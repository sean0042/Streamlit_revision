1,2,16993438,What interventions were applied to treat the patient's right lower extremity claudication?,Vancomycin IV and oral clindamycin for severe skin infection,Blood transfusion due to severe anemia,Femoral artery stent placement in left lower extremity,Right lower extremity angiogram with angioplasty and stent placement in the SFA/Popliteal,Warfarin and Atenolol medication adjustment for atrial fibrillation,D,"The right lower extremity claudication in the patient was treated with an angiogram followed by angioplasty and stent placement in the SFA/Popliteal according to note 2. Though A implies an intervention, it was for left lower extremity cellulitis, not for the right lower extremity claudication. Option B doesn't apply as the notes don't mention any severe anemia or need for blood transfusion. Choice C is incorrect because it refers to a prior intervention in the left extremity, not a current intervention in the right extremity. Option E refers to the adjustment of medications for Afib, not for treating the right lower extremity claudication. Therefore, D is the correct answer."
2,2,12530274,What was the change in the patient's left lower extremity condition from her first to second admission?,The swelling and erythema of her left leg completely disappeared.,There was no notable change in the patient's left lower extremity from her first to second admission.,"The erythema and burning pain in the shin persisted, and an open blister on the lateral part of the left heel began to develop.",A deep venous thrombosis developed in her left lower extremity.,A significant fracture of her left tibia occurred between the first and second admission.,C,"From the information given in the medical notes, we can see that the patient's left lower extremity condition worsened from her first to the second admission. While erythema and edema were present during the first admission, the patient returned with these symptoms persisting along with an open blister on the left heel during the second admission. This makes option C the correct answer.   Option A is incorrect because the records show that her condition did not fully resolve. Option B is not correct as there was a development of a blister on the left heel. Option D is not correct as the ultrasound reports provided indicate there was no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity. Finally, option E is false because there was no occurrence of a significant fracture to the patient's left tibia between the two admissions."
3,2,15334900,What type of obstruction was observed according to the notes from patient's previous doctor visit and did patient's condition improve during the present visit?,A partial small bowel obstruction was diagnosed in the previous visit and the patient's condition deteriorated in the present visit.,The patient was diagnosed with a full small bowel obstruction in the previous visit and there was no change in her condition in the present visit.,A pseudo obstruction was diagnosed in the previous visit and the patient's condition was similar in the present visit.,The patient was diagnosed with a partial small bowel obstruction in the previous visit and her condition improved in the present visit.,A large bowel obstruction was diagnosed in the previous visit and the patient's condition declined in the present visit.,D,"According to the provided notes, the patient was diagnosed with a partial small bowel obstruction in the previous visit. During the follow-up visit, the patient's condition had improved. She was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and voiding without assistance. While options A, B, and C contain information that appears in the notes, they are incorrect as they do not accurately represent the type of bowel obstruction diagnosed or the change in the patient's condition during the follow-up visit. Option E is wrong as the notes do not mention any large bowel obstruction."
4,2,19287786,What was the initial presentation and management approach for this patient's episode of diverticulitis?,"The patient presented with lower right leg pain, erythema, and swelling and was given oral antibiotics.","The patient's symptoms comprised severe headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, and congestion, and was treated with intravenous fluids.",The patient complained about constant left lower abdominal pain experiencing fevers and chills. She was managed in the ED with cipro/flagyl and admitted for her diverticulitis.,"The patient exhibited signs of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was given a high protein diet.",The patient visited with symptoms of urinary complaints and was managed with prescribed hydration.,C,"The patient complained of constant left lower abdominal pain for three days, including fevers and chills, and found to have sigmoid diverticulitis based on an abdominal CT scan. In the ED, she received treatment with cipro/flagyl and was admitted for further management of diverticulitis as mentioned in the discharge summary. The rest of the options are incorrect as A, D, and E are symptoms not related to diverticulitis and were not observed in this case. Option B has symptoms that do not match the discharge summary, making it a good distractor."
5,2,19298760,"What were the surgical procedures conducted during the first hospital admission, and were there any complications post-operation?",The patient underwent a Percutaneous fixation of anterior column fracture with supra-acetabular screw and Left tube thoracostomy without any post-operational complications.,The patient had a stent placement in the heart during the first hospital admission and had to be re-admitted after complications developed.,The patient had a kidney transplant during the first hospital admission and later developed sepsis.,"The patient was treated for traumatic aortic dissection with St Jude valve and CABG, but had vitamin deficiencies post-surgery.",The patient underwent a colonoscopy and endoscopy procedures on the first admission and had some bleeding post-procedure.,A,"The correct answer is derived from the ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure"" section of the first note where two procedures are mentioned - Left tube thoracostomy and Percutaneous fixation of anterior column fracture with supra-acetabular screw. It is stated in the ""Brief Hospital Course"" section, there were no intraoperative complications. Option B, C, D, and E are incorrect as these procedures or complications are not mentioned in the record of the first hospital admission. While it is noted that the patient has had aortic dissection repair surgery in the past, this was not conducted during the referenced hospital admission."
6,2,15079271,What were the patient's main symptoms and the previous treatments that led to the decision for her to undergo an abdominal myomectomy and removal of likely benign left ovarian tissue on her first admission?,The patient came in with symptoms of colonic inertia and had previously undergone a subtotal colectomy.,The patient had been dealing with constipation and was undergoing treatment with sennas.,The patient exhibited symptoms of worsening pelvic pain due to a fibroid uterus and had been previously treated with Depo-Provera and oral contraceptive pills.,Previous treatment with escitalopram oxalate and bupropion led to the decision for the procedure.,The patient demonstrated worsening abdominal pain due to a fibroid uterus and was previously treated with antibiotics.,C,"The patient had a fibroid uterus that got worse over time, resulting in increased pelvic pain. Previous treatments included Depo-Provera and oral contraceptive pills, which caused weight gain and weren't successful in mitigating the pain. Thus, the decision was made for an abdominal myomectomy and to remove likely benign left ovarian tissue. The other answer choices (A, B, D, E) are from other parts of the patient's history and treatments, but they do not directly connect to the decision for the abdominal myomectomy and removal of likely benign left ovarian tissue. Therefore, they serve as good distractors."
7,2,12517485,"What was the primary concern of the patient's second admission after his first discharge, and what medical intervention was carried out to address this issue?","The patient was admitted due to complications from diabetes, and was treated with MetFORMIN and glimepiride","The patient was admitted due to hemochromatosis, and was put on a regimen of iron-chelating medications","The patient was admitted for midepigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting and underwent ERCP for the removal of a partially obstructing CBD stone","The patient was admitted because of GERD symptoms, and was therefore put on a diet management and medication plan","The patient was admitted for persistent abdominal pain after previous gallbladder surgery, and a repeat cholecystectomy was performed.",C,"The note from the patient's second admission shows that the main reason for his readmission was midepigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Upon examination, he was found to have a partially obstructing CBD stone. The medical intervention that was carried out to address this issue was Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which resulted in the successful removal of the stone. Answer choices A, B, D, and E outline conditions or interventions that do pertain to this patient, but are not directly related to his second admission or the corresponding intervention for that admission. Choice A pertains to his ongoing diabetes management, B refers to his ongoing hemochromatosis condition which is a chronic issue, D mentions his GERD which wasn't the cause for the second admission, and E incorrectly mentions a repeat cholecystectomy which wasn't performed."
8,2,15541241,What was the clinical outcome of the patient's acetaminophen overdose and how did this affect her progression and ultimate discharge from her initial medical admission?,"The patient experienced acute liver failure due to the acetaminophen overdose, resulting in a prolonged hospital stay.",The patient's acetaminophen overdose led to permanent damage to her nervous system and required neurologic rehabilitation services.,"The patient's acetaminophen ingestion was effectively treated. It did not result in any physiological sequelae, and she was discharged to a psychiatric facility.","The patient required several surgical interventions due to complex acetaminophen toxicity, which extended her hospital admission.",The patient passed away in the hospital due to complications from the acetaminophen overdose.,C,"The discharge summary shows that the patient's acetaminophen overdose was effectively treated with no observable physiological sequelae (as mentioned in the briefing note). This facilitated her transfer from the medical floor to psychiatry, and ultimately to 'Extended Care'. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they contradict this information. Option A is incorrect because the patient did not experience acute liver failure. Option B is incorrect because there was no permanent damage to her nervous system. Option D is incorrect because there's no mention of surgical interventions. Option E is incorrect because the patient did not pass away. Hence, these options serve as good distractors as they provide outcomes typically feared with acetaminophen overdose but are not correct in this particular case."
9,2,17851073,What was the patient's primary complaint during the visit recorded on 2165-04-09 and how was it managed?,"The patient's primary complaint was severe neck pain related to a herniated disc in the cervical spine and it was managed conservatively with medications including acetaminophen, dilaudid, gabapentin, and ativan.",The patient presented with abdominal pain associated with GERD and was managed with PPI medications.,The patient had chronic shoulder pain that was managed with a combination of physical therapy and medication.,The individual complained of acute weakness or numbness which were managed by running a series of tests including an MRI.,The patient suffered intense headaches and migraines managed by administration of ativan.,A,"The patient's chief complaint during the visit on 2165-04-09 (note 2) was abdominal pain which was discovered to be related to an isolated celiac artery dissection, unrelated to his previous neck pain. So option A is incorrect. Option B is incorrect because the GERD was part of his past medical history, not the chief complaint for the visit on this date. Option C and D is also incorrect as there was no mention of chronic shoulder pain and acute weakness or numbness on this given date. The same applies to option E, there was no mention of intense headaches and migraines during this visit. Hence, none of the options provided are correct answers."
10,2,16899219,"What medication was the patient advised to potentially restart in the outpatient setting once her Liver Function Tests (LFTs) normalize, following the possible adverse drug reaction during her admission charted on 2167-01-26?",The patient was advised to restart Aspirin.,The patient was advised to restart Atorvastatin.,The patient was advised to restart Vitamin D.,The patient was advised to restart Hydrocerin.,The patient was advised to restart B Complex.,B,"The patient's discharge summary reveals that the healthcare team considered the possibility of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome resulting from her consumption of Atorvastatin. Upon discharge, the patient was urged to consider retaking a different, more generally tolerated statin such as Pravastatin once her liver function tests normalize in an outpatient environment. This implicates that it is Atorvastatin which is the possible culprit behind the patient's drug reaction. The other medications mentioned in the options (Aspirin, Vitamin D, Hydrocerin, and B Complex) were either continued during the patient's hospital stay or were not implicated in the reaction, and thus they are incorrect."
11,2,12969720,What was the key preliminary finding from the liver mass biopsy conducted as per the note charted on 2181-09-14 and how did it influence the course of medical care near the end of the said hospital stay?,"The liver mass biopsy showed that the patient had cholangiocarcinoma and indications of cirrhosis. Consequently, he was scheduled for a follow-up with oncology for further deliberation, and transplant surgery and hepatology were contacted for appointments.","The liver mass biopsy revealed the presence of non-hodgkins lymphoma which was related to the patient's earlier treatment, and he was scheduled for chemotherapy.","The liver biopsy exhibited signs of acute liver failure and hence, a liver transplant was arranged for the patient to improve his condition.","Findings from the liver mass biopsy indicated signs of hepatitis C and as such, the patient was placed on antiviral therapy to manage the condition.","The liver mass biopsy indicated a benign liver tumor and as such, the patient was scheduled for a regular monitoring of the mass every six months.",A,"From the discharge summary, it can be gleaned that the preliminary result of the liver mass biopsy was consistent with cholangiocarcinoma and showed a background of cirrhosis. This guided the course of medical care near the end of the hospital stay by necessitating scheduling with oncology as well as contacting transplant surgery and hepatology to discuss the case. The other options (B, C, D, E) present incorrect but plausible distractors based on information present in the discharge summary or common liver conditions."
12,2,13587041,"What is the reason for the patient's diagnosis with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during the hospital visit marked by the note charted on 2175-11-07, and how does it compare to his previous visit as per the note charted on 2175-10-13?","The patient was diagnosed with DKA due to high levels of magnesium in the blood, similar to his previous visit.","The patient's DKA resulted from missed insulin doses during his current visit, whereas during the previous visit, the cause was unclear.","The patient's DKA was caused by hypertensive complications, consistent with the previous visit.","During both visits, the patient's DKA was triggered by excessive alcohol intake.","The patient's DKA diagnosis was a result of poor dental hygiene, just like his previous visit.",B,"The notes from both visits indicate that the primary factor leading to the patient's DKA in the second visit was not taking insulin as prescribed. In contrast, during the patient's prior visit, the cause of the DKA was not clearly identified. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they include elements of the patient's health history but they are not directly linked with the cause of the DKA for the specific visits."
13,2,14108194,What precautionary measures were taken to ensure fetal lung maturity in the patient's second admission due to PPROM?,The fetus was given infant vitamins to support growth.,The administration of Nifedipine for preterm labor was done.,Administration of betamethasone to accelerate the development of fetal lungs.,The fetus was monitored with ultrasound to ensure fetal lung development.,Antibiotics were given to the patient to treat infection and protect the fetus.,C,"Betamethasone was given to the patient to promote fetal lung development, as mentioned in the note 2 where it states ""She received latency antibiotics as well as betamethasone for fetal lung maturity."" Betamethasone's proven effects on accelerating fetal lung maturity made it the correct choice. Option A is incorrect as there was no mention of infant vitamins given to the fetus. Option B is incorrect as Nifedipine was used to treat preterm labor, not to ensure fetal lung maturity. Option D is incorrect as ultrasound was not used specifically for lung maturity. Finally, option E is incorrect because while antibiotics were administered, that was to treat GBS bacteriuria, not specifically for fetal lung maturity."
14,2,12879899,What kind of surgery did the patient undergo during her first admission and what anticoagulant was she prescribed on discharge for DVT prophylaxis?,Patient underwent a heart valve replacement surgery and given Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.,Patient had a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and was prescribed Warfarin as a preventive measure for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).,"The patient had an Open Reduction and Internal Fixation for left distal femur fracture. After the procedure, Enoxaparin (Lovenox) was prescribed as a precautionary measure for DVT.",The patient underwent cataract surgery and was prescribed Rivaroxaban as a preventive measure for DVT.,Patient had a hip replacement surgery with Aspirin administered as a prophylactic for DVT.,C,"The note mentioned that during her first admission, the patient underwent Open Reduction and Internal Fixation for a left distal femur fracture. For the prevention of DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis), she was prescribed Lovenox (Enoxaparin) at the time of discharge. Even though options A, B, D, and E state procedures and medications that could be used in a health care setting, they are not applicable to the context of this patient and her condition or treatment."
15,2,18876822,What was the main reason for the patient's admission on the date 2147-03-11 and what were the primary surgical measures undertaken to address it?,The patient was admitted due to recurrent incisional hernia and treated with a craniotomy for resection of parasaggital meningioma.,"The patient was admitted due to left leg tingling and weakness, and was treated with a right craniotomy and resection of the mass.",The patient was admitted due to parasagittal meningioma and treated with craniotomy and resection of the tumor.,"The patient was admitted due to the recurrent incisional hernia and treated with lysis of adhesions, component separation, and ventral hernia repair with retrorectus mesh.","The patient was admitted due to chronic renal insufficiency and was treated with lysis of adhesions, component separation, and ventral hernia repair with retrorectus mesh.",D,"The patient’s chief complaint upon admission on 2147-03-11 was a recurrent incisional hernia as per note 2. The primary surgical measures undertaken were lysis of adhesions, component separation, and ventral hernia repair with retrorectus mesh. Options A, B, and C refer to a different patient's admittance according to note 1 and therefore are incorrect. Option E mentions an incorrect reason for admission (chronic renal insufficiency) which is a past medical history from note 1 and 2, but it was not the chief complaint on the given date."
16,2,16410990,What medication changes were made to manage the patient's sudden catatonic like symptoms and were these medications continued at discharge?,"The patient was given a dose of timolol maleate for her catatonic symptoms, which was continued at discharge.","The patient was given trial of Lorazepam 2mg IV and she didn't receive more Lorazepam at discharge. At psychiatrist unit, she was started on mirtazapine, olanzapine, and lorazepam and was discharged with these medications.","The medications for the catatonic symptoms were not altered, and she was discharged on her original medication regime.",The patient was given a dose of indamethacin to manage her catatonia and this was continued upon discharge.,The patient was not given any medication for her catatonic symptoms.,B,"The mentioned medication, Lorazepam, was chosen to manage the patient's catatonic symptoms and result in improvement of her mood and talkativeness, but it wasn't continuous at discharge. When she was admitted to the psychiatric ward, she was started on mirtazapine, olanzapine, and lorazepam and these were continued upon discharge. The other options (A, C, D, E) mention drugs that either weren't used (timolol maleate, indamethacin) or weren't revised (none done, or no medication). Although she was on other drugs (like timolol maleate), these weren't specifically administered to handle her catatonic symptoms, hence they are incorrect distractors."
17,2,16703304,Did the patient have any complication due to her UTI and Right Groin Infection that were diagnosed on her second admission?,She had surgical complications due to her UTI and Right Groin Infection.,The patient's Right Groin Infection led to significant pain and erythema.,The patient's UTI led to a cardiac arrest.,She had no complications related to her UTI and Right Groin Infection.,Her UTI and Right Groin Infection led to severe renal failure.,B,"Based on the notes (specifically note 2), the patient had a UTI and a right groin infection during her second admission. There was mention that her right groin wound was tender with a palpable mass, showing erythema confined to the wound edges. This suggests there were complications, specifically in the form of physical discomfort and localized inflammation due to the infection. The other options are incorrect. Option A suggests surgical complications which is not indicated in the notes. Option C implies the occurrence of a cardiac arrest related to her UTI, which was also not indicated. Option D is incorrect as the patient had complications related to the infections - inflammation and tenderness at the groin wound site. Option E refers to severe renal failure that didn't occur according to the notes."
18,2,10819027,What combination of medications did the patient leave the hospital taking after his recent stroke event?,"Aggrenox, Enoxaparin, and Montelukast","Naprosyn, Ambien, and Viagra","Pravastatin, Warfarin, and Enoxaparin","ASA EC, Pravastatin, and Aggrenox","Tylenol, Motrin, and Enoxaparin",C,"Based on the discharge summary present in note 2, the patient was discharged with the medications Pravastatin, Warfarin, and Enoxaparin. This makes option C correct. The remaining options are distractors. Option A includes Aggrenox which according to the notes was discontinued due to headaches. Option B includes Naprosyn, Ambien, and Viagra, which are 'as-needed' medications and weren't mentioned as discharge medications. Option D lists ASA EC, but this medication was replaced by Warfarin. Finally, option E includes Tylenol and Motrin, which were not listed in the patient's discharge medications."
19,2,15903067,"How many times has the patient undergone a penile prosthesis surgery due to prior failures, as documented in the discharge summaries?",The patient has not undergone any penile prosthesis surgeries due to prior failures.,The patient has undergone one penile prosthesis surgery due to prior failures.,The patient has undergone three penile prosthesis surgeries due to prior failures.,The patient has undergone two penile prosthesis surgeries due to prior failures.,The patient has undergone four penile prosthesis surgeries due to prior failures.,D,"The discharge summaries mention that the patient has had two instances of ""removal and replacement of penile prosthesis"" due to failures. This is documented in both note 1 and note 2. Options A, B, C and E are incorrect as they do not align with the number of instances documented in the discharge summaries. Although the summaries discuss other medical procedures and conditions, the specific question is pertaining to the number of times the patient has had a penile prosthesis replacement due to failure."
20,2,14864471,What changes were made to the patient's medication regimen following her hospitalization in 2139 for atypical chest pain as compared to the previous admission in 2137 for coronary vasospasm?,The patient was given ibuprofen to take daily.,Aspirin was discontinued from the patient's medication regimen.,"The patient was started on dual calcium channel blocker therapy with Diltiazem and Amlodipine and the dosage of existing medication, Isosorbide Mononitrate, was updated.",The patient was prescribed Prednisone to manage chest pain.,Atenolol was reintroduced to the patient's medication regimen.,C,"During the patient's hospital stay in 2139 outlined in note 2, the patient was started on a dual calcium channel blocker therapy with Diltiazem and Amlodipine, and was also continued on the long acting nitrate isosorbide mononitrate. This is a change compared to her stay in 2137 (in note 1), when she was discharged on Amlodipine and aspirin, but no Diltiazem or modified dosage of Isosorbide Mononitrate was mentioned. Therefore, option C is correct. The patient being given ibuprofen (Option A) or being prescribed Prednisone (Option D) was not mentioned in the notes, making these options incorrect. Option B is incorrect as the patient was not discontinued from Aspirin, it was continued in both hospital stays. Atenolol, mentioned in Option E, was discontinued in the patient's updated medication regimen in 2137 and was not reintroduced in 2139."
21,2,18549646,"What were the cardiac-related surgical procedures performed on the patient in the most recent encounters, prior and post the AVR replacement with a 25mm valve, as per the discharge summaries?",The patient underwent Right CFA PSA thrombin injection and had a permanent pacemaker placed.,The patient had an AVR using a 21mm paramount pericardial valve/CABG in the latest encounter.,The patient was treated with carvedilol and vitamin D for cardiac relaxation.,The patient had her aortic valve stenosis managed with pharmacological therapies like asprin.,The patient had a minor surgery to manage the side effects of the major cardiac procedure.,A,"In the provided notes, there was a record of the patient undergoing a Right CFA PSA thrombin injection [note 1], which is a cardiac-related surgical procedure. It was also noted [note 2] that after the AVR replacement with 25mm valve, a permanent pacemaker was placed. Therefore, Answer A is correct. Answer B is not correct because the AVR/CABG procedure was done using the 21mm valve, not after the AVR replacement with the 25mm valve, which was the specific period asked in the question. Answer C is not a surgical procedure but rather a medical treatment. Answer D is incorrect because the patient underwent surgical procedures rather than purely pharmacological management for her aortic valve stenosis. And Answer E is wrong because no minor surgery was taken to manage the side effects of the mentioned surgical procedure in the ""recent encounters, prior and post the AVR replacement with a 25mm valve""."
22,2,12359958,"What was the initial cause of the patient's bladder rupture, as mentioned during the patient's first hospital admission?",His liver cirrhosis caused the bladder rupture.,It was due to his alcohol abuse causing high ethanol levels in the blood.,The rupture occurred due to an underlying malignancy in the bladder.,The patient's bladder ruptured due to a fall followed by worsening abdominal pain.,The patient's high blood pressure caused the bladder to rupture.,D,"According to the discharge summary, the patient was initially admitted to the hospital after a fall and experienced worsening abdominal pain. Imaging results revealed a bladder rupture (Careful reading points to a fall as the potential cause of the rupture). The presence of alcohol, blood ethanol levels, does not cause bladder rupture, they only explain the behavior of the patient (falling in the liquor store). Liver cirrhosis, high blood pressure, or underlying bladder cancer, mentioned in the summary, are not the cause of bladder rupture, they are a part of the patient's medical history. Hence, ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" and ""E"" are incorrect options."
23,2,11296133,What was the reason for the patient's second admission and did her conditions and medications change from the first to second admission?,She was admitted the second time due to right hip pain and her medications remained the same.,"The patient was admitted for breast cancer treatment, and her condition got worse from the first admission.",The patient was admitted due to left intertrochanteric femur fracture and her medication changed.,She was admitted the second time due to a detached retina and her condition improved from the first admission.,The patient was admitted for a hernia repair and her medications changed from the first admission.,C,"The patient was admitted the second time due to ""left intertrochanteric femur fracture"" as stated in the chief complaint of note 2, and her medications did change from the first to the second admission. The other choices, A, B, D, and E, are not correct as they don't present the correct reason for her second admission or the accurate change in her condition and medication."
24,2,13151494,What was the impression from the CT scan on the patient's first admission and was it addressed in the subsequent visit?,"The CT scan suggested the presence of lymph nodes near the subcarinal area, possibly related to a neoplastic process, metastatic disease, lymphoma, or Castleman disease.",The CT scan hinted at evidence of pulmonary embolism.,An 8-cm abscess was detected in the gallbladder fossa leading to chronic cholecystitis.,"It pointed towards the presence of hepatic steatosis, a condition of fatty liver.",The CT scan revealed abnormalities in the aortic pathway.,A,"On the patient's first admission, the CT scan suggested an 8-cm abscess in the gallbladder fossa and the presence of subcarinal lymph nodes, hinting at a possible neoplastic process, metastatic disease, lymphoma, or Castleman disease (Option A). Both these findings were addressed when she was re-admitted. The subcarinal lymph node was later evaluated, and the abscess in the gallbladder fossa was drained. Option B, D, and E are incorrect as they refers to conditions that were not found in the CT scan during her first admission. Option C is incorrect because while the 8-cm abscess in the gall bladder fossa was mentioned, it did not result in chronic cholecystitis - the patient was already diagnosed with it before the CT Scan."
25,2,19547843,"What were the clinical manifestations and signs of the patient's recurrent, metastatic adenosquamous lung cancer during his second admission, as outlined in the 'discharge summary' of the chart date of 2143-04-14?","The patient presented with shortness of breath, fatigue, malaise, decreased oral intake.",The patient experienced persistent 1cm pneumothorax and air leak from chest tube after right upper lobe wedge resection.,The patient was admitted for evaluation and management of suspected infected pleural fluid.,The patient had a hematocrit drop from 42 to 22 preoperatively and required blood transfusions.,"The patient was seen in clinic for an urgent appointment due to cough, inability to tolerate food or liquids, abdominal pain and distension.",A,"In the discharge summary dated 2143-04-14, it is mentioned that the patient with recurrent, metastatic adenosquamous lung cancer presented with 4 days of fatigue, malaise, decreased oral intake, and shortness of breath. Option B is incorrect as it refers to the patient’s first admission and not the second one. Option C is incorrect as suspected infected pleural fluid is not a clinical manifestation or sign of lung cancer. Option D is incorrect as a drop in hematocrit level and need for blood transfusions are not manifestations of lung cancer, but complications related to surgery. Option E includes symptoms that the patient did not experience such as inability to tolerate food or liquids, abdominal pain and distension."
26,2,16792119,What was the major surgical procedure conducted during the patient's second admission to the hospital and why was it performed?,The patient underwent an ERCP procedure to extract gallstones obstructing the biliary duct.,The patient was treated for cholecystitis through medication and therapeutic diet.,The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to manage acute cholecystitis.,The patient was subjected to a sphincterotomy to manage pancreatitis.,The patient underwent a laparotomy to manage transaminitis symptoms.,C,"In the second admission note, it's stated that the patient underwent a major surgical procedure of ""Laparoscopic cholecystectomy."" This was performed to manage the patient's acute cholecystitis, a severe gallbladder inflammation, often caused by gallstones.   Even though options A, D, and E also mention surgical procedures, they were not conducted during the patient's second admission. Option A describes the ERCP procedure, which was actually conducted during the patient's first admission, not the second one. Option D describes the procedure of a sphincterotomy which, even though it was conducted as a part of the ERCP during the first admission, it's not the surgical procedure that was performed in the second admission.   Option E, mentioning laparotomy to manage transaminitis, is incorrect because no such procedure was performed during the second admission. Lastly, option B is incorrect as the patient was not treated merely with medication and diet, but significant surgical intervention was performed."
27,2,11986523,What was the reason for the patient's second hospital admission and what major surgical procedure was performed during this admission?,The patient was admitted for symptomatic aortic stenosis and underwent a cardiac catheterisation.,The patient was admitted for symptomatic coronary artery disease and underwent a drug eluting stent.,The patient was admitted for an evaluation of aortic stenosis that had progressed over the year and underwent an aortic valve replacement.,The patient was admitted for chest pain and underwent AVR.,The patient was admitted for hyperlipidemia and undergone a coronary artery bypass graft.,C,"The second hospital admission was due to a progression in the patient's aortic stenosis. The surgical procedure performed was an aortic valve replacement. Although Options A, B, D, and E mention conditions or procedures the patient has experienced, they do not correctly answer the question about the second admission."
28,2,14674146,"What were the differences in symptom presentations in the patient's hospital visits on 2132-03-29 and 2135-04-03, and what were the diagnoses in these cases?","The patient presented with the same symptoms during both visits, specifically abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and the diagnosis in both instances was gastroenteritis.","The patient's 2132-03-29 visit was characterized by symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and dizziness, leading to a diagnosis of gastroenteritis. Meanwhile, the second visit in 2135-04-03 exhibited similar symptoms but without diarrhea, leading to a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis and dehydration.","In the 2132-03-29 visit, the patient complained about heartburn and indigestion, and was diagnosed with acid reflux. In the 2135-04-03 visit, the patient complained about nausea and vomiting, and was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis and dehydration.","During the 2132-03-29 visit, the patient reported experiencing headaches and a fever, and was diagnosed with influenza. The 2135-04-03 visit resulted in a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis and dehydration based on reported symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.","In the first visit in 2132-03-29, the patient suffered from seizures and was diagnosed with epilepsy. In the second visit in 2135-04-03, they complained about nausea and vomiting and were diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis and dehydration.",B,"During the patient’s visit on 2132-03-29, they complained about nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and dizziness. After evaluation and tests, the patient was diagnosed with gastroenteritis (as indicated in the discharge diagnosis). On the patient's second visit on 2135-04-03, they reported symptoms of nausea, vomiting, but no mention of diarrhea. This led to a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis and dehydration. The other options clearly mismatch the symptoms with diagnosis or don’t match the symptoms or diagnosis at all from the discharge summary notes."
29,2,19116441,What were the past medical history of the patient noted on the previous discharge summaries and was there any changes in the patient's condition that could relate to her past medical history?,"Past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation while current condition includes palpitations.",The patient's past medical history includes a-fib and RUQ pain and the current condition is deteriorated mental condition.,The patient's past medical history includes an allergy towards statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors and the current condition shows abnormal albumin levels.,The patient's past medical history includes COPD and MI while the present condition indicates inflamed lungs.,The past medical history is limited to hyperlipidemia and the current condition reflects elevated lipase levels.,A,"The correct answer choice comes from the fact that the patient's past medical histories of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are enumerated in both note 1 and note 2, and the current condition of palpitations could be related to the past history of atrial fibrillation. The other answer choices are incorrect because:  - Choice B, while the mental condition is checked during discharge, there is no indication of a deteriorated mental state.  - Choice C is incorrect because while she does have an allergy to statins, there's no clear relation to her current condition related to albumin levels.  - Choice D is incorrect due to the fact that COPD and MI are part of the patient's family history, not personal medical history. - Choice E is incorrect because lipase is not elevated and hyperlipidemia is just part of her past medical history but no relations to current conditions are explained."
30,2,18448526,What was the treatment plan provided for the patient's condition of urinary retention and what changes were made to his home medications during his second visit to the hospital?,"The patient was given IV Ondensetron 4mg, 2L of NS IVF, and Simethicone 80 mg, and retained the foley catheter deposited during his previous visit. His home medications were kept the same.","The patient was placed on CBI, and all home medications were resumed except for his Coumadin. Instead, the patient is to begin taking 81mg of aspirin daily.",The patient was put on Simvastatin and also provided with a Folic acid supplement. No changes were made to his home medications.,The patient was given medications to treat his hypercholesterolemia. The doses of his home medications were increased.,The patient was offered counseling to manage his hypertension. There were no adjustments made to his current prescriptions.,B,"According to the second note, during the patient's second hospital visit, he was placed on Continuous Bladder Irrigation (CBI) as a treatment for his urinary retention. Additionally, all his home medications were resumed except for his Coumadin. Instead, he was advised to start taking 81mg of aspirin daily. The options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they either reference treatments from the first hospital visit or mention changes to home medications that were not stated in the second note."
31,2,15375104,What is the new medication allergy added to patient's medical records during the latest hospital stay and how was it handled during her hospital stay?,The new allergy labelled was to 'adhesive tape' which was adjusted by discontinuing its usage.,The new allergy added was to 'Aspirin' which was managed by switching to an alternate anticoagulant.,The new allergy was 'Neurontin' and its use was discontinued during her stay at the hospital.,The allergy to 'Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)' was newly listed and was treated with antihistamines.,The allergy to 'Ciprofloxacin' was found and dealt with by switching to another antibiotic.,C,"The discharge summary mentions about an addition to the allergy list which includes 'Neurontin' which was not present in the previous discharge summary. Hence, it was added during the latest hospital stay. There is no explicit mention of how this newly found allergy was handled, but since this medication does not appear in the discharge medication list, it can be inferred that its usage was discontinued during her hospital stay.  Option A is incorrect as 'adhesive tape' was already in the allergy list. The allergies to 'Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)' and 'Ciprofloxacin' were pre-existing, thus options D and E are incorrect. Even though 'Aspirin' is mentioned in the discharge medications list, there is no indication that the patient is allergic to Aspirin, making option B incorrect as well."
32,2,19978718,"What was the primary reason for the patient's readmission to the hospital on 2157-09-14, and what steps were taken to manage her key issues?","The patient was readmitted due to severe headaches related to hypertension, and a Cesarean section was performed.","The patient was readmitted for post-operative management after her Cesarean section, and her blood pressure was closely monitored.","The patient was readmitted due to hypertensive urgency and an associated headache, and she was given antihypertensive medications and monitored by the Nephrology department.","The patient was readmitted for anxiety and depression, and her regular medications were continued alongside consultations with a psychiatrist.","The patient was readmitted for chronic renal insufficiency; various tests were conducted, including a renal ultrasound, but no specific treatment was given.",C,"The discharge summary in note 2 clearly identifies hypertensive urgency as the chief complaint on admission. The patient's condition was managed by adjusting her blood pressure medications and consultations with the Nephrology department due to her renal complications. The other options are incorrect as they either refer to conditions that were managed during her previous admission (Options A, B, and E) or are secondary issues that were continued rather than being the primary reason for readmission (Option D)."
33,2,19783346,"Has the patient experienced any allergic reactions to antibiotics and if so, which specific antibiotics are listed in his clinical history?",The patient has a known allergy to Doxazosin.,The patient has a known allergy to Amoxicillin.,The patient has a known allergy to Pantoprazole.,The patient has a known allergy to Sertraline.,The patient has no known allergies to any antibiotics.,B,"In the discharge summary, it is indicated that the patient has allergies to Codeine, Latex, and Amoxicillin (an antibiotic). All the other options list medications or substances to which the patient is not recorded as being allergic, though they are mentioned elsewhere in his medical notes. As such, only option B is correct."
34,2,16683251,"What was the patient's suspected diagnosis based on the event that occurred at her ophthalmology appointment in September 2114, and how does it relate to her past medical history?",The patient was diagnosed with increased nasopharyngeal secretions due to recent intubation.,"The patient was suspected of having a syncopal episode, possibly connected to reported vomiting.",The patient was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse as a result of her event.,The patient was diagnosed with an acute arterial abnormality in the neck.,The patient was suspected of having an epileptic seizure due to her past history of epilepsy.,B,"The suspected diagnosis based on the September 2114 ophthalmology appointment event is a syncopal episode (a temporary loss of consciousness typically caused by a drop in blood pressure). This is stated in the ""Brief Hospital Course"" section of the admission dated 2114-09-02. This is related to her past medical history as she has had prior traumatic brain injury and both epileptic and non-epileptic seizures. The other answer choices represent elements of her medical history or symptoms experienced in the hospital, but not her suspected diagnosis based on the event at the ophthalmology appointment. Although the patient in question has a history of seizures, it was deemed by neurologists that the event at the appointment was more consistent with syncope rather than a seizure."
35,2,10723150,What is the major surgical or invasive procedure the patient underwent during his hospital stay in 2145?,"Patient was put on medication trials, which included celexa and campral.",Patient had his amoxicillin-clavulanic acid medication adjusted.,Patient underwent perineal/scrotal abscess drainage and debridement.,Patient was treated with a dose of Diltiazem for shaky symptoms.,Patient went through psychotherapy to address his depression and anxiety.,C,"In note 2, taken from the chartdate in 2145, it states that the major surgical or invasive procedure the patient underwent was perineal/scrotal abscess drainage and debridement.   Option A is incorrect as it refers to the medication trials the patient was put on during his admission under psychiatry in 2142, and not a surgical procedure. Option B is incorrect because adjustment of medication is not a surgical or invasive procedure. Furthermore, this took place upon discharge. Option D is wrong because the administration of Diltiazem is a medication intervention and not a procedure. Lastly, option E is a distractor with information taken from note 1, where the patient did undergo therapy, but it is not a surgical or invasive procedure and took place in a different year."
36,2,15400964,What was the change in the patient's left knee condition from the first hospital admission to the second one?,The patient's left knee remained infected and required additional procedures.,The patient had a spacer inserted into the left knee and there were no changes in condition during the second admission.,"The patient underwent resection arthroplasty, an antibiotic spacer placement during the first admission, and during the second admission, this spacer was removed and a complicated total knee arthroplasty was performed.",The patient didn't show any sign of improvement following the procedures during the two admissions.,The condition of the left knee became complicated and the situation became worse gradually.,C,"As per notes from the first and second admissions, the patient's knee condition changed as he underwent a resection arthroplasty and an antibiotic spacer placement during the first admission (as indicated under ""Chief Complaint"" and ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure"" in note 1). In the second admission (as seen in note 2), the antibiotic spacer was removed and the patient underwent a complex total knee arthroplasty. Option A is incorrect, since it is not mentioned that the patient's left knee remained infected in the second admission. The statement in option B that there were no changes in condition during the second admission is incorrect because the patient underwent a surgery to replace the antibiotic spacer with a complex left total knee arthroplasty. Options D and E are incorrect as the notes do not suggest any lack of improvement or worsening condition in the patient's knee."
37,2,15575167,What were the major surgical or invasive procedures performed during both hospitalizations and can you explain how these procedures were related?,The patient underwent two sessions of rectal dilation and a sigmoidoscopy during the hospitalizations. They are related because the rectal dilation makes the sigmoidoscopy procedure easier.,"The patient underwent a cystoscopy, right retrograde pyelography, right ureteral stent exchange, and right dismembered pyeloplasty during both hospital stays. These procedures are directly related to treating his major diagnosis of right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.",The major surgeries performed on the patient were two instances of a tonsillectomy during both hospitalizations. These procedures are related as they were repeated due to complications from the first operation.,The patient had a colonoscopy and a polypectomy during his hospital stays. Both procedures are related to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.,"A dental extraction and a sinus surgery were performed on the patient in the hospitalizations. They are related, as a dental infection may have contributed to the sinus infection.",B,"The discharge summary for both admissions clearly outlines the major surgical or invasive procedures performed. The right ureteral stent exchange, right retrograde pyelography, cystoscopy, and right dismembered pyeloplasty were the major procedures carried out on both instances. These procedures are related as they all pertained to the same causative condition - right ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which was causing the right hydronephrosis diagnosed in the patient. The other options while drawn from possible terms within the discharge note, are not applicable to the specific medical situation of the patient."
38,2,11685894,What was the treatment plan employed to manage the patient's mood disturbances that were reported as a side effect of Keppra during the patient's second admission on 2133-01-10?,"Increased Lamictal dose from 150mg to 200mg BID, continued Keppra at 1000mg BID, and added Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) at 50mg BID","Decreased Lamictal dose to 150mg BID, ceased Keppra, and introduced Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) at 50mg BID",Ceased the Keppra therapy and substituted it with Lamictal at a dose of 200mg BID and Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) at 50mg BID,"Continued Lamictal at 150mg BID, increased Keppra to 1500mg BID, and added Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) at 100mg BID",Keppra treatment was stopped due to the mood disturbances and was replaced by Temodar treatment and the continuation of Dexamethasone at current dosing,A,"Based on the patient's chart from the second admission on 2133-01-10, the correct answer is A. The patient was continued on Keppra 1000mg BID. Lamictal was increased from 150mg to 200mg BID. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) at a dose of 50mg BID was added to combat the mood side effects of Keppra. All other options are incorrect as they don't align with the exact changes made to the patient's medication regime during the second admission. The changes as stated in options B, C, D, and E were not recorded. It's worth noting that Temodar and Dexamethasone as mentioned in option E were indeed continued, but as part of the ongoing therapy for GBM, rather than as part of the management for mood disturbances hence option E is also incorrect."
39,2,14044103,"What was the presenting complaint of the patient on their second visit to the hospital, and what was the treatment provided?",The patient came in with complaints of left breast pain and fever and was treated with Kefzol 1g IV followed by outpatient follow-up.,The patient presented with symptoms of mastitis and was subjected to a major surgical procedure.,The patient reported vaginal bleeding and was treated with cytotec and 2 units of blood for transfusion as well as iron supplements upon discharge.,The patient complained of abdominal cramping and was prescribed DiCLOXacillin 500 mg.,The patient presented with a large amount of blood in her bed and was prescribed ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain management.,C,"In the second note, it is indicated that the patient presented with vaginal bleeding, which landed her readmission into the hospital. The treatment provided included Cytotec administration, 2 units of blood for transfusion, and iron supplements upon discharge, after her bleeding normalized. Options A and D refer to the symptoms and treatment during the patient's first visit to the hospital, not the second one. Option B is incorrect because no major surgical procedures were carried out during either of the patient's hospital visits. Option E, although hinting at the patient's symptom of bleeding, does not correctly detail the treatment provided at the second visit."
40,2,18844607,Did the patient have any known allergies and did it change between the two hospital admissions?,The patient is allergic to Levothyroxine Sodium and Metoprolol Succinate XL.,The patient's allergies to alendronate sodium were noted only in the second hospital admission.,The patient's allergy to alendronate sodium was consistently recorded in both hospitalizations.,The patient does not have any known allergies.,The patient was allergic to alendronate sodium in the first admission but not in the second one.,C,"The patient's allergy to alendronate sodium is noted in both the first and second set of medical notes, indicating that this did not change between the two hospital admissions. The other options are incorrect because option A is false as the patient is not allergic to Levothyroxine Sodium and Metoprolol Succinate XL, but is allergic to alendronate sodium. Similarly, options B and E are false because the patient's allergies to alendronate sodium were consistently recorded in both hospital admissions. Option D is incorrect because the patient does have a known allergy."
41,2,17416730,"What are the conditions leading to the patient's cirrhosis, and what factors might have contributed to the developing duodenal ulcer?","The patient's cirrhosis was caused by hypertension, and duodenal ulcer developed due to cholecystitis.","The patient's cirrhosis was primarily due to excessive alcohol intake (EtOH), and the development of the duodenal ulcer could be attributed to the usage of certain medications and potential Helicobacter Pylori infection.","The patient developed cirrhosis due to his morbid obesity, and the duodenal ulcer occurred as a result of an inflamed gallbladder.","Hepatic encephalopathy led to the patient's cirrhosis, and the duodenal ulcer was a result of abnormal liver function.","Cirrhosis was caused by severe abdominal pain, and the duodenal ulcer was developed due to fever and chills.",B,"As per notes, the patient's medical history indicates that the cirrhosis was due to excessive alcohol intake (EtOH cirrhosis) and potentially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The development of the duodenal ulcer could be attributed to multiple factors such as the patient's overall poor health status, use of certain medications, and potential infection with Helicobacter Pylori (as there is a mention of checking serum pylori antigen). Choices A, C, D, and E mention factors that are present in the patient's symptoms or history but do not directly cause cirrhosis or duodenal ulcers. This makes them incorrect but plausible distractors."
42,2,18855630,What surgical procedures did the patient undergo and what were the reasons for these procedures as described in the patient's discharge summaries?,The patient had an Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) procedure to fixate his bilateral mandibular fractures caused by an assault with a brick.,The patient underwent a craniectomy with a titanium mesh placement for a frontal calvarium fracture induced by a car accident.,The patient had a neurosurgical operation to repair a depressed cranial fracture prompted by a blunt head trauma.,The patient got surgical treatment for a right frontal craniectomy and pneumocephalus due to a violent altercation.,The patient underwent emergency surgery for bilateral mandibular and skull fractures following significant head injury during a robbery incident.,A,"The correct answer is A because according to the second discharge summary, the patient underwent an Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) for his bilateral mandibular fractures (jaw fractures), which were due to an assault with a brick.  Options B, C, and D involve surgical procedures that the patient did undergo, notably craniectomy, but these options incorrectly state the causes of these procedures. Option E is incorrect as it mentions the incorrect reason for the patient's fractures."
43,2,10658377,"What was the patient's discharge diagnosis at the end of her first hospital visit, charted on 2192-01-15?",Severe abdominal pain with suspected gastrointestinal conditions.,History of seizures along with hypertension.,Prolonged hematochezia leading to consitpation.,Diagnosed with ischemic colitis with a secondary indication of diverticulosis.,Regular episodes of BRBPR (Bright Red Blood Per Rectum).,D,"The patient's discharge summary dated 2192-01-15 states that the primary discharge diagnosis was ischemic colitis and diverticulosis. Option A is incorrect because although the patient came in with abdominal pain and a suspicion of gastrointestinal conditions, it was not the final discharge diagnosis. Option B is incorrect even though the patient has a history of seizures and hypertension, these conditions were not part of the discharge diagnosis for this specific visit. Option C is wrong because even though the patient reported BRBPR symptoms and constipation, these were symptoms, and not the final diagnoses. Option E is wrong because, BRBPR (Bright Red Blood Per Rectum) is a symptom and not a diagnosis."
44,2,16735649,What changes in medications were noticed between the patient's two hospital admissions and what were their reasons?,"The first hospitalization saw the inclusion of multivitamins and docusate sodium in the discharge medication, and the second hospitalization included lisinopril and pregabalin.","In-between the two hospital admissions, the patient stopped taking alprazolam and started taking lidocaine patches.",The patient's medication was changed from jpratropium-Albuterol inhalation spray to Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus for asthma control between the two hospital admissions.,The second hospitalization introduced a regimen of PredniSONE with varying dosages designed to taper down.,The patient stopped taking clotrimazole 1% cream and was introduced to Lidocaine 5% patch and pregabalin for pain management.,D,"The patient was put on a PredniSONE taper during the second hospitalization, which was not a part of the original medications listed at the time of the first hospital admission. This indicates a change in medication. The reason mentioned in the notes is that she was being treated for an asthma exacerbation. This steroid is typically used to reduce inflammation in conditions like asthma. The prescription mentioned a tapering schedule, indicating that it was likely a temporary treatment for the acute issue. The other options are incorrect as there are no mentions of jpratropium-Albuterol inhalation spray, clotrimazole 1% cream been stopped, and alprazolam been stopped which are used as distractors. A multivitamin and docusate sodium were included in the first hospitalization but there was no mention of them being discontinued in the second admission, which makes it irrelevant to the question."
45,2,16009507,What was the significant postoperative observation from the patient's first admission and how was it managed?,"After the operation, the patient developed a low-grade fever from a urinary tract infection, which was managed with antibiotics.","Following the surgery, a boil was observed on the patient's right thigh that was treated with daily packing and dressing changes.","The patient was noticed to have high blood pressure post surgery, which was controlled with intravenous fluids.","After the surgery, the patient complained of severe pain which was managed with a combination of intravenous and oral pain medications.",The patient became hypotensive after the operation which was controlled with a 1L bolus of IV fluid.,A,"As per the discharge summary of the first admission, post-operatively, the patient had an elevated temperature and heart rate. Urinalysis confirmed a urinary tract infection that was treated with Cipro (an antibiotic). Options B-E, while containing information from the discharge summaries, are incorrect because they refer either to management strategies that weren't significant observations (like pain management - D), observations and treatments from the second admission (like treatment of a boil - B, and management of hypotension - E), or non-existent observations (like high blood pressure - C)."
46,2,10128171,What were the changes in medication dosage or medication type as observed in the two admission records?,The patient's Divalproex Sodium intake was changed to twice a day from TID.,The patient's Furosemide was increased from 40 mg to 80 mg per administration,The patient stopped taking Plavix due to his subdural hematoma and his Lasix was decreased to 40 mg daily,The patient was prescribed a higher dosage of Digoxin to stabilize his condition.,The patient was instructed to double his intake of Lisinopril.,C,"On discharge (referencing note 1), it is indicated that the patient's dosage of Lasix was decreased from 80mg to 40mg daily for patient's fluid balance. Also, medication Plavix was stopped due to the subdural hematoma that the patient had. None of the other options are accurate based on the information given in both notes. The distractors A, B, D and E are incorrect because they represent medicines and dosages that are listed in both notes and there is no indication of any changes. Only option C accurately reflects changes in medication between the two hospital admissions."
47,2,15754497,"What significant post-operative complications did the patient experience between her first and second admission, and what medical steps were taken to manage these complications?",The patient developed rashes from nylon sutures used during the surgery.,The patient experienced dizziness and a significant drop in her hemoglobin count.,"The patient experienced abdominal pain and distension, which was managed by monitoring and conducting CT scans to check for blockage.",The patient had allergic reactions to antibiotics administered post-surgery.,The patient showed signs of infection at the site of the surgical incision.,C,"The correct answer is (C), which refers to the post-operative issues noted in both the first and second admission. The patient developed post-operative ileus, abdominal distension and was readmitted due to abdominal pain. Medical management included monitoring, placement of an NG tube, keeping the patient NPO till bowel function returned, and conducting CT scans to check for blockages. Options A, B, D and E are incorrect as those complications were not mentioned in the patient's discharge summary."
48,2,10395376,What was the fluctuation in the patient's presurgical bilirubin levels during his cholecystectomy procedure and how did it change post-surgery?,The presurgical bilirubin levels remained consistent at 2.3.,The presurgical bilirubin levels increased from 2.3 to 3.0.,"The presurgical bilirubin levels initially were at 2.3, then spiked to 10, and then reduced to 0.8 post-surgery.",The presurgical bilirubin levels were 1.3 and increased to 3.0 post-surgery.,The presurgical bilirubin levels were always 0.8.,B,"In this patient's case, according to the discharge summary, it is mentioned that the patient's bilirubin level was 2.3 during his admission to the Emergency Department and increased to 3.0 prior to the cholecystectomy procedure. After the surgery, it was found that the bilirubin levels had normalized to 0.8 at the time of discharge. Hence, option B is correct. The remaining options are incorrect but all are plausible because they contain numbers or concepts included in the note, which helps them serve as suitable distractors."
49,2,10490754,"What treatments were administered to the patient after her aspirin overdose, as per the discharge summaries charted on 2185-05-06 and 2185-05-11?",The patient was given antihistamines to alleviate allergic reactions.,The patient underwent a major surgical procedure to remove overdosed aspirin from her system.,"Intravenous fluids and activated charcoal were given, along with sodium bicarbonate to promote excess aspirin excretion through urine.",The patient was administered an extensive antibiotic regimen to counteract possible infections.,The patient was given insulin-based treatment to regulate her blood sugar levels.,C,"The discharge summaries indicate that the patient was initially given activated charcoal— often used in drug overdoses to bind the substance and keep it in the stomach and intestines. This prevents the substance from being absorbed into the body. From there, the patient was put on a sodium bicarbonate drip to alkalinize the urine, which assists in clearing salicylates from the body. Options A, B, D, and E are mentioned in the notes but are not relevant to the treatment of the patient's overdose. The patient does have a known allergy to antihistamines, so option A would likely have caused further harm. Moreover, there's no mention of a major surgery (Option B), antibiotics (Option D), or insulin-based treatments (Option E) in the context of treating her aspirin overdose."
50,2,18841084,What were the main reasons for the patient's re-admission on 2138-10-10?,Patient was re-admitted due to chest pain and signs of a heart attack,Patient was re-admitted because of surgical infection and complications related to surgery,Patient was re-admitted due to the exacerbation of her diabetes,Patient was re-admitted for further evaluation of shortness of breath,Patient was re-admitted due to complications related to her ESRD and requirement for a new dialysis schedule,D,"In note 2, under ""History of Present Illness,"" it is stated that the patient presented to the ER with shortness of breath. It's mentioned that she was re-admitted for further evaluation of these symptoms. In options A and B, the notes don't mention the patient experiencing chest pain or surgical complications. As for option C, though the patient does have diabetes, it wasn't listed as a reason for her re-admission. Lastly, option E is incorrect because while patient has ESRD and on Hemodialysis, there was no requirement for a new dialysis schedule mentioned in the notes. Therefore, these distractors are plausible because they relate to the patient's medical history but aren't supported by the specifics of the given hospital notes."
51,2,13800033,What surgical procedures were conducted on the patient during her second visit and what were they indented to address?,Left hip hemiarthroplasty to treat a pathological fracture of her left hip.,Underwent an operation to mend a fracture in her left femoral neck.,Received an injection to alleviate her diabetes mellitus.,Liquid volume was administered to rectify her low blood pressure.,Open Cholecystectomy and pelvic mass resection to resolve acute cholecystitis and an unknown pelvic mass.,E,"The correct answer is E as during the patient's second visit, she underwent an open cholecystectomy and a pelvic mass resection. The procedures were performed to treat acute cholecystitis and an unidentified pelvic mass. Answer choice A is incorrect because the left hip hemiarthroplasty was conducted during her first visit. Option B is a rephrase of option A and is also incorrect. C and D are incorrect as they are related to conditions mentioned in her medical history and not the surgical procedures conducted during her second visit."
52,2,18023211,What was the identified cause for the patient's frequent falls during her previous hospital stay as per the note charted on 2142-01-22?,The patient was showing symptoms of dilantin toxicity.,The patient had a history of dementia which caused her balance issues.,The patient suffered from hypothyroidism causing her muscles to weaken and resulted in falls.,The patient's falls were primarily due to orthostatic hypotension.,"The falls were multi-factorial: the patient showed impatience and often did not wait for assistance, there was an elevated phenytoin level in her blood, and she suffered from peripheral neuropathy.",E,"In the provided notes charted on 2142-01-22, it is explicitly stated that the frequent falls were due to multiple factors. This includes impatience, elevated phenytoin levels and peripheral neuropathy. While Options A, B, and D are potentially contributing factors, they are not given as the primary reasons in the notes. Option C, while present in the patient's medical history, is not referenced as a cause for her falls in the specific hospital stay the question refers to."
53,2,13843093,"Did the patient have any electrolyte imbalance during her first visit to the hospital? If yes, what were they?",The patient had low magnesium levels that required augmentation.,The patient had elevated hemoglobin levels that called for treatment.,The patient had lower-than-normal sodium levels that needed adjustment.,The patient had high potassium levels which needed treatment.,There was an imbalance due to high glucose levels that required moderation.,D,"From the details given in note 1, during the patient's first visit to the hospital, the labs were notably high for potassium (6.3). The other electrolytes mentioned in the answer choices (magnesium, hemoglobin, sodium, and glucose) were all within the normal range, and there is no mention of treatment being required for these elements. Hence, options A, B, C, and E would be incorrect."
54,2,11854719,"Did the patient have any complications after the left total knee replacement surgery, and if so, how was it managed?",The patient showed no sign of complications after surgery and was discharged to home in stable condition.,"The patient suffered from severe pain, which was managed through IV and oral pain medications.","The patient faced complications of hypotension and dizziness on Day 1 post-operation, which was managed by giving 500cc of LR bolus.",The patient developed an infection at the surgical incision site which was treated with antibiotics.,The patient had abnormal discharge from the surgical wound which was managed by changing the surgical dressing.,C,"From the notes, it is clear that the patient faced complications of hypotension and dizziness on the first day post-operation, this condition was managed by giving him a 500cc LR bolus. The other options are incorrect but act as good distractors. Option A is incorrect as the patient did face a complication post-surgery. Options B, D, and E are incorrect because the medical notes do not mention the patient experiencing severe pain, infection at the surgical site, or abnormal discharge from the wound post-surgery."
55,2,17908992,What major surgical procedures has the patient undergone on her left leg and why were they performed?,Application of multilateral ex-fixator and ORIF bicondylar tibial plateau fracture were performed due to a right leg osteomyelitis.,Left medial tibia closing wedge osteotomy and removal of hardware were performed due to the left clavicle fracture.,"LLE external fixation placement and removal, and ORIF L. tibial plateau fracture were performed due to a left tibial plateau fracture resulted from a motor vehicle accident.",LLE external fixation placement and removal were performed due to valgus deformity of the left lower extremity.,ORIF L. tibial plateau fracture was performed due to a chin laceration.,C,"In Note 1, it's stated the patient sustained a left tibial plateau fracture from a motor vehicle accident and had procedures ""LLE external fixation placement and removal,"" and ""ORIF L tibial plateau fracture"". The other options are incorrect as ""left medial tibia closing wedge osteotomy and removal of hardware"" was performed for valgus deformity of the left lower extremity (option B&D are incorrect); the leg osteomyelitis was a medical history and it was on the right leg, not contributing to the left leg's surgery (option A is incorrect); also, the patient's chin laceration is unrelated to the left leg surgery (option E is incorrect). These four distractors are from the contents of the provided notes but are not correct answers to this question."
56,2,17070596,"What was the final pathology report identified from the pleural biopsy of the patient's repeat admission, and what was the follow-up plan for this condition?","The final pathology report identified benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), and the follow-up plan was to schedule an appointment with the primary care doctor for a chest x-ray.","The final pathology report identified Varicose Veins, and the follow-up plan was to keep the patient under regular observation.","The final pathology report identified Metastatic Lung Malignancy consistent with a lung primary Adenocarcinoma, and the follow-up plan included a brain MRI, consultation with Oncology as an outpatient, and a following up appointment with the primary care doctor.","The final pathology report identified Cystitis, and the follow-up plan was consultation with Urology.",The final pathology report identified Bronchiectasis and follow-up plan was a consultation with his Pulmonologist.,C,"Choice C is correct because, according to note 2, the final pathology from the pleural biopsy confirmed Adenocarcinoma consistent with a lung primary. The follow-up plan included a brain MRI to check for brain metastasis, seeing Oncology as an outpatient to discuss next steps in management, and having sutures removed at an Interventional Pulmonary appointment. Choices A, B, D, & E are incorrect, as the conditions mentioned (BPH, Varicose Veins, Cystitis, Bronchiectasis) were a part of the patient's medical history and not the results of the recent biopsy. The follow-up plans mentioned in these choices have been deliberately mismatched and are not in line with the care plans for those specific conditions."
57,2,16873303,"What were the primary and secondary diagnoses for the patient's visit charted on 2110-04-14, and how were they related to the visit charted on 2110-04-03?","Primary diagnosis: Stage III colon cancer; Secondary diagnoses: Neuropathic pain, lower back injury, insomnia, depression, cirrhosis, hypertension; These diagnoses were carried over from the visit charted on 2110-04-03.","Primary diagnosis: Malignant polyp; Secondary diagnoses: Post-op tachycardia, low urine output, urine retention, cholelithiasis; The surgical procedures performed on the visit charted on 2110-04-03 were related to these diagnoses.","Primary diagnosis: Wound infection; Secondary diagnoses: Depression, abdominal ascites; These diagnoses were new conditions developed after the visit charted on 2110-04-03.","Primary diagnosis: Sigmoid neoplasm; Secondary diagnoses: Diabetes Mellitus type II, alcohol abuse, neuropathic pain, cirrhosis; These were ongoing diagnoses unrelated to the visit charted on 2110-04-03.","Primary diagnosis: Liver cirrhosis; Secondary diagnoses: Stage III colon cancer, alcohol abuse; The cirrhosis diagnosis was an escalation from the visit charted on 2110-04-03 where the patient was diagnosed with colon cancer.",C,"The primary diagnosis for the patient's visit charted on 2110-04-14 was wound infection and the secondary diagnoses included abdominal ascites and depression. These diagnoses were a result of complications from the patient's previous visit charted on 2110-04-03, where major surgeries were performed. The other options, although they include conditions present in the patient, were not the primary and secondary diagnoses for the visit charted on 2110-04-14."
58,2,14918528,"What was the final diagnosis and completed treatment plan for the patient's hand abscess situation when she was admitted on the 6th of January, 2164?",The patient was diagnosed with left hand pain and treated with levaquin and vanco.,"The patient was diagnosed with a hand infection/abscess which was treated through the surgical debridement of the wound, IV antibiotic treatment, wound soaking, and a discharge prescription for ciprofloxacin and clindamycin.",The patient was diagnosed with suicidal ideation and given a 1:1 sitter until she was deemed safe.,The patient was diagnosed with Hepatitis C however treatment was not initiated as an inpatient due to low viral load.,The patient was diagnosed with IVDU cocaine and was transferred for further management.,B,"The correct answer is B. The patient was diagnosed with a hand infection/abscess. The treatment plan included wound debridement, IV antibiotics (levaquin and vancomycin), and a discharge prescription for ciprofloxacin and clindamycin. The patient was also given wound soaking and dressing changes three times a day. Despite options A, C, D, and E being part of the patient's overall health status, they do not answer the specific question regarding the final diagnosis and treatment plan for the patient's hand abscess."
59,2,13958023,Did the patient experience any complications following either their Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy and Laparoscopic total abdominal hysterectomy procedures?,The patient experienced a surgical complication in the form of an anastomotic leak.,The patient had slight abdominal pain and increased heart rate resulting in an exploratory laparoscopic surgery.,The patient had an allergic reaction to a drug taken post-surgery.,The patient experienced a complication in the form of bandemia post-surgery.,The patient developed blood clot in her leg post-surgery.,B,"According to the details mentioned in the discharge summary, the patient did face complications of abdominal pain, rapid heart rate, and fever post-surgery. These symptoms led to an exploratory laparoscopic surgery. Hence, Option B is correct. Options A, C, D and E are incorrect as the summary does not provide any evidence of an anastomotic leak, allergic reaction to drugs, bandemia, or develop blood clot. However, these are good distractors as such complications can occur post-surgery."
60,2,15036658,What was the outcome of the patient's colonoscopy as described in the discharge summary from the stay starting on 2113-09-30?,The colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis in the transverse colon.,The patient was found to have gastrointestinal hemorrhages during the colonoscopy.,The colonoscopy detected sigmoid colon diverticulosis without other abnormalities.,The colonoscopy showed increased internal hemorrhoids.,The colonoscopy found malignant adenoma in her colon.,C,"The discharge summary from the stay that started on 2113-09-30 described colonoscopy findings as ""unremarkable"" with the exception of ""diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon"" (choice C). Choice A is incorrect because it mentions diverticulosis but in the wrong location of the colon. Choice B is incorrect as there were no gastrointestinal hemorrhages mentioned in the results. Choice D is incorrect because internal hemorrhoids were mentioned in her past medical history, not the result of this colonoscopy. Choice E is incorrect as there was no mention of a malignant adenoma being detected in this colonoscopy."
61,2,19898631,"What was the chief complaint leading to the patient's hospital readmission shortly after being discharged from his robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with left pelvic lymphadenectomy, and what interventions were taken to address this during his stay?","The patient was readmitted due to a severe urinary tract infection after surgery, and the treatment was aggressive antibiotic therapy.",The patient was readmitted because of severe uncontrollable pain after surgery. Pain medication was accordingly administered and adjusted.,The patient was readmitted due to thrombocytopenia and treated with blood transfusions.,"The patient was readmitted because of post-operative ileus, and the treatment included intravenous hydration, nasogastric tube placement, and diet modifications.",The patient was readmitted because of post-operative anemia and treated with iron supplements.,D,"From the information provided in note 2, the patient was readmitted due to post-operative ileus following the surgery. To address this, the patient was given intravenous hydration, a nasogastric tube was placed, the patient was kept nil per oral (NPO) until the passing of flatus and bowel movement, and the diet was gradually resumed as the patient's condition improved.  The rest of the options (A, B, C, E) while they contain bits of medical information present in the notes, they do not correctly answer the main question. They thus serve as good distractors."
62,2,18537350,What was the patient's diagnosis upon discharge after his second admission?,Fibromyalgia,Seizure disorder and Polysubstance abuse,Corrosive substance abuse,Epilepsy,Coronary artery disease,B,"In the discharge summary noted in [note 1 end], it mentions that the patient was diagnosed with 'seizure disorder not otherwise specified' and 'polysubstance abuse'. Hence, option B is the correct answer. Although other options appear in the patient's history, context indicates these were not the primary discharge diagnoses. Options A, C, D, and E are not correct as they were not stated as the diagnosis upon discharge after his second admission, they either appear in medical history or were not mentioned at all on discharge."
63,2,15698381,What medication adjustments were made concerning the patient's psychotic symptoms throughout the two hospital admissions and what was the patient's final prescription upon the last discharge?,"The patient was initially prescribed Abilify 15 mg, then the dosage was increased to 20 mg in the first admission with no changes in the second hospital admission.","The patient was first given Abilify 5 mg, the dosage was increased to 15 mg and augmented with 2 mg Haldol PO BID. In the second admission, the Abilify dosage was further increased to 20 mg per day and supplemented with Risperdal 1 mg PO BID along with Ativan 0.5 mg once a day.","The patient was started on an antipsychotic, and then was shifted to Haloperidol without any changes in the second admission.",The patient was given Abilify 15 mg with no changes in the second admission. Haldol and Risperdal were added in the second admission.,"The patient was first prescribed Haldol 2 mg, and then switched to Abilify 5 mg in the second hospital admission.",B,"The correct answer is B because it correctly summarizes the patient's medication journey across the two hospital admissions. The patient was initially started on Abilify 5 mg, which was increased to 15 mg and then augmented with 2 mg Haldol. In the second admission, the Abilify was further increased to 20 mg per day and Risperdal 1 mg PO BID and Ativan 0.5 mg were added. This is supported by text in the discharge summaries. All the other options are incorrect because they either omit or incorrectly mention the medication changes. But, they are good distractors as they include other medications mentioned in the discharge summaries."
64,2,15420554,What were the surgical procedures carried out during the patient's second stay and what was the rationale behind them?,The patient underwent a procedure of ERCP where a stent was placed to open up bile ducts.,"The patient was undertaken for exploratory laparoscopy, robot-assisted arteriolysis of common hepatic, splenic, celiac, left gastric, and aorta as well as division of median arcuate ligament.",The patient underwent surgery to resolve obstructive sleep apnea.,The patient underwent surgery removing a benign tumor from the neck.,The patient carried out a surgery procedure for the removal of gallstones.,B,"The correct answer is B because the patient's second stay surgical methods included ""Exploratory laparoscopy and Robot-assisted arteriolysis of common hepatic, splenic, celiac, left gastric and aorta as well as division of median arcuate ligament"". These measures were taken as part of the strategy to restore flow in his celiac trunk, to allow for safe execution of a radical pancreaticoduodenectomy, without causing liver and bile duct ischemia or needing arterial reconstruction. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect but are good distractors. Option A is from the first note and not the second. Options C, D, and E were written with similar length to the correct answer to maintain consistency and they don't appear in either notes, which is why they are incorrect."
65,2,18825120,What procedures had the patient undergone for fecal incontinence initially and what were the complications that further led to the creation of an ileostomy and its subsequent reversal?,"The patient underwent an ovarian cyst removal due to fecal incontinence. Complications from this procedure led to an ileostomy, which was later reversed due to continuous pain.","The patient had a fistula takedown, overlapping sphincter repair, and a gracilis interposition flap conducted initially. The resultant complications included a large perineal defect and an ongoing fistula from the mid-anal canal to the perineal defect, which necessitated the creation of an ileostomy. The ileostomy was later reversed.","Fecal incontinence in the patient was first treated with a hip replacement. Due to complications of the hip replacement procedure, the patient had to undergo an ileostomy, which was later reversed due to poor recovery.","The patient first underwent a tonsillectomy because of fecal incontinence which led to infection complications, leading to ileostomy. This was later reversed due to chronic post-operative pain.","The patient had a lung transplant due to fecal incontinence. As a result, the patient had a complication of shortness of breath that led to the creation of an ileostomy, which was later reversed due to unnecessary overhydration.",B,"The correct answer is the one that accurately states the initial procedures for fecal incontinence, which are mentioned in note 1 as a fistula takedown, overlapping sphincter repair, and a gracilis interposition flap. The complications that led to the creation of an ileostomy were a large perineal defect and ongoing fistula. This is stated in both notes 1 and 2. Eventually, note 2 states the ileostomy was reversed. The other options are incorrect as they mention procedures like ovarian cyst removal, hip replacement, tonsillectomy, and lung transplant which are not mentioned in the notes. Therefore, these options are good distractors as they seem plausible procedures but are not based on the information given in the notes."
66,2,17791695,"What was the final diagnosis on discharge by the Psychiatry team for the patient's condition, and what changes were made, if any, to the patient's medication regimen during their stay at Psychiatry?","The final diagnosis was pneumonia and rib fractures, and Abilify was added to the patient's medication regimen.","The final diagnosis was severe delirium, and Depakote 1000mg was eliminated from the patient's medication regimen.","The patient was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder type I, most recent episode manic, severe, with psychotic features and the Psychiatrist increased the dose of Depakote and Abilify during their stay.",The diagnosis was mechanical fall and the patient was prescribed Levaquin 750mg by mouth daily.,The patient was diagnosed with COPD and was prescribed albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler.,C,"The correct answer choice is C because, the patient had been diagnosed with ""Bipolar disorder type I, most recent episode manic, severe, with psychotic features"" by the psychiatry department and Depakote (divalproex) and Abilify (aripiprazole) were adjusted during the patient's stay. The patient was on 1000mg Depakote BID and Abilify 5mg PO Daily on admission and the dosages were increased to Depakote delayed release was increased to 1000mg daily and 1500mg QHS, and Abilify to 5mg daily and 10mg qhs. Answer choices A, B, D, and E are incorrect, as these diagnoses and medications were either not provided by the psychiatric team or there were no changes noted to the medication regimen for the patient's specific condition in those areas."
67,2,11388457,What was the patient's heart condition diagnosed during their second hospital visit which warranted treatment with metoprolol and apixaban?,The patient was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation.,The patient was diagnosed with Hypertension.,The patient was diagnosed with Type II diabetes.,The patient was diagnosed with Osteoarthritis.,The patient was diagnosed with Atrial Flutter.,E,"While notes from the second hospital visit (Note 2) indicate that the patient had multiple conditions such as Hypertension and Type II diabetes, the correct answer is Atrial Flutter. The medical note indicates that the patient was diagnosed with Atrial Flutter and prescribed metoprolol and apixaban, establishing a direct link between the illness and the prescribed treatment, fulfilling the requirements of the question. The other options, while they are conditions noted in the patient's medical history, do not correlate with the specifics of the question, as neither of these conditions require treatment with metoprolol and apixaban."
68,2,19508930,What were the results of the patient's post-operative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after her surgery for parathyroid adenoma in her left mediastinum?,The patient's PTH levels showed an increase.,The patient's PTH levels were 35 post-operation and 54 at last check.,The patient's PTH levels were normal pre-operation.,The patient's PTH levels were not measured after the surgery.,The document does not provide information on the patient's PTH levels post-operation.,B,"The information provided in the discharge summary reveals that the patient's post-operative PTH was 35 and the last measurement yielded a 'normal' result of 54. Choice A is incorrect because the notes indicate a decrease, not an increase, in PTH levels after surgery. Choices C and D are incorrect because the document explicitly mentions the measurement of PTH levels post-surgery, and does not provide any information on pre-operative PTH levels. Choice E is incorrect as information about the patient's PTH levels post-operation is explicitly mentioned in the notes."
69,2,10800710,What was the reason for the patient's AKI during the admission documented on 2163-07-30 and how was it managed ?,The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) during the 2163-07-30 admission was primarily due to dehydration caused by nausea and high blood pressure. The AKI was handled with fluid replacement therapy and discontinuation of hypertension medications.,The patient’s AKI was due to the surgical procedure performed and it was managed using antibiotics and pain medications.,The patient's AKI was primarily because of pulmonary embolism and was managed by blood thinning medications.,The patient's AKI was due to an epidural abscess and was managed through surgical intervention.,The patient's AKI was due to advanced degenerative disc disease and was managed by sophisticated disc replacement therapy.,A,"In the discharge summary from 2163-07-30 (Note 2), it is mentioned that the patient's AKI was due to hypertension and dehydration. Fluid therapy was administered and the hypertension medications were stopped to manage the AKI. Option A correctly paraphrases this information from the text. The other options (B-E) provide details that were documented in the patient's medical records but do not correctly address the question as they are about other conditions or treatments not directly related to the AKI during the 2163-07-30 admission."
70,2,18394610,What changes were made to the patient's medication regimen during the hospitalization in 2148 to deal with her hyponatremia and acute renal failure?,The patient's dosage of tacrolimus was increased.,The patient was put on an IV lasix regimen.,Antibiotics were discontinued after 9 days.,The patient was started on a higher dose of insulin.,Invasive surgical procedure was performed to correct the abnormalities.,B,"The patient was admitted to the hospital in 2148 with hyponatremia and acute renal failure, among other issues. Modifications to her medication regimen included the introduction of intravenous lasix to aid in fluid removal. The higher dose of lasix was continued upon discharge. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. While other changes were made to her medication regimen, such as ceasing antibiotics after 9 days (Option C), these modifications were not related to her hyponatremia and acute renal failure. Options A and D mention changes in the patient's tacrolimus and insulin management, but these alterations were not associated with the ongoing acute medical conditions. Lastly, there's no mention of invasive surgery being performed during her hospital stay (Option E), and not at all connected to manage her hyponatremia and acute renal failure."
71,2,18383270,"What was the patient initially admitted for at the hospital, and what medical procedures did the patient undergo during their subsequent stay?",The patient was initially admitted for abdominal aortic aneurysm and underwent a fenestrated endovascular aortic repair with angioplasty of the renal arteries.,The patient was initially admitted for R hip pain and large R psoas hematoma and underwent a surgery for the same.,"The patient was initially admitted for a fall leading to a hematoma, and no major surgical or invasive procedure was performed.","The patient was originally admitted for a fall, hitting his right hip, leading to R hip pain and a large R hip hematoma, and the AAA repair was performed during the very same admission.",The patient was initially admitted due to hypertension and diabetes mellitus and a surgery was performed to manage these conditions.,C,"The patient was initially admitted due to a fall that resulted in R hip pain and a large R psoas hematoma. No surgeries were conducted during this admission, as indicated by the note: ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None"". Every other choice involves a surgery, making them incorrect. Though the AAA repair did occur during a subsequent stay (noted in the second note), it did not occur during the initial admission. Hence, the correct answer is C."
72,2,19480802,What were the two primary surgical interventions that the patient underwent for the management of his sigmoid diverticulitis and when were these performed?,The patient underwent a colostomy surgery on 2126-05-24 and an appendectomy on 2126-08-11.,The patient had two abdominal drain placements on 2126-05-24 and a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy in 2126-08-11.,The patient had an abdominal drainage performed on 2126-05-24 and another one on 2126-08-11.,The patient underwent a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy on 2126-05-24 and a colonoscopy on 2126-08-11.,The patient was treated with medication on 2126-05-24 and underwent a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy on 2126-08-11.,B,"From the given notes, we can infer that the two primary interventions were the abdominal drainage and a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. The first notes mention that two guided abdominal drains placements were performed to treat diverticulitis with abscess. The second notes show that a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy was performed on a later date due to continued diverticulitis. Thus, option B is correct. Options A, C, D, and E are not correct. The patient did not undergo a colostomy, appendectomy, second abdominal drainage, colonoscopy, or purely medication-based treatment. However, these are good distractors as they all involve procedures that could be related to gastrointestinal issues."
73,2,10449006,What was the reason for the patient's second admission to the hospital as per the note charted on 2170-10-08 and what were the findings during the operation?,"The patient was admitted due to hypertension and during the operation, two small nodules were found near the gastroepiploic artery.","The patient was admitted due to a gastric cancer which was on the greater curvature of the stomach and during the operation, it was found that the cancer had metastasized with numerous, very small peritoneal implants on the serosa of the small and large bowel.",The patient was admitted due to anemia and it was found during the operation that there were evidences of metastatic disease.,"The patient was admitted for a left Achilles tendon repair and during the operation, an obstructing tumor was found.","The patient was admitted due to presyncope and during the operation, carcinomatosis was found.",B,"The patient was admitted to the hospital on the second instance because of gastric cancer. During the operation, it was discovered that the cancer had metastasized across various peritoneum on the serosa of both the small and large bowels. Option A isn't correct as there's no mention of nodules near the gastroepiploic artery being discovered during an operation in link with hypertension. Option C isn't correct because anemia wasn't the reason for the second admission and no evidence of metastatic disease was found during operation due to this. Option D isn't correct because the Achilles tendon repair was a past medical history, not a reason for the second admission. Lastly, option E isn't correct because the patient was admitted for presyncope in the first note, not the second one and no mention of discovering carcinomatosis during the operation was made."
74,2,10523295,"From the provided discharge summaries, can we conclude that the patient presented any positive leukocyte or nitrate urine test result?",The patient showed positive leukocyte and positive nitrate results in her urine test.,Both leukocyte and nitrate tests in the urine were negative.,The urine tests displayed moderate levels of leukocytes and negative nitrate results.,The patient's urine tests were inconclusive for leukocyte and nitrate presence.,Only nitrate levels were elevated in the patient's urine test while leukocyte test was negative.,B,"In the first discharge summary, the results for leukocyte and nitrate presence in the patient's urine were explicitly stated as negative. While these clinical markers are mentioned in the provided notes, no other options indicate that the leukocyte and nitrate tests came back positive. This is why option B is the correct answer. The other options are good distractors because they all involve information about leukocyte and nitrate tests in general, which can be confusing, especially given the extensive clinical details involved in the discharge summaries. However, these options are incorrect simply because they do not accurately reflect the results of the patient's test as described in the notes."
75,2,13480254,What were the major clinical interventions administered during the patient's last two hospital admissions and how did the patient react to these interventions?,"In the patient's last two hospital admissions, he underwent a knee replacement surgery and an AAA Endovascular repair, but had persistent sternal pain.","The patient underwent AAA endovascular repair and right total knee replacement during his last two hospital visits, but he developed atrial fibrillation after the surgeries.","The patient underwent a Coronary Artery Bypass and thoracentesis in his last two admissions. He responded well to these procedures, reporting an immediate improvement in his shortness of breath and was stable in both situations.","In the last two hospital visits, the patient was treated for high blood pressure and hypercholesterolemia. However, he was readmitted due to worsening chest pain.","During the previous two admissions, the patient had a Coronary Artery Bypass and a Right Total Knee Replacement. However, he had to be readmitted due to worsening heart failure.",C,"Option C is correct because during the patient's first site visit, a coronary artery bypass was performed due to exertional angina which the patient tolerated well. In the subsequent visit due to shortness of breath, a left thoracentesis was performed for a pleural effusion, leading to an immediate improvement in symptom. Other options mention interventions (AAA endovascular, knee replacement surgery) which were not a major part of the treatment plans at the last two admissions, hence are incorrect."
76,2,13265318,"Did the patient have a history of Atrial Fibrillation prior to their visit in 2187, or was this the first instance of the condition?","The patient had atrial fibrillation before 2187, identified during a surgery.",The patient's first instance of atrial fibrillation was during their visit in 2187.,"The patient had atrial fibrillation, but the exact time of diagnosis is unknown.",The patient does not have any record of atrial fibrillation.,The patient was suspected to have atrial fibrillation but it was never confirmed.,B,"From the notes, we can see that the patient had a new onset of atrial fibrillation recorded during the period of the second note in 2187. Option A is incorrect because atrial fibrillation was not identified during the patient's surgery described in the first note. Option C and D are not correct as we have a clear record of atrial fibrillation in 2187, and it was not mentioned at all in his history in the first note. Option E is also incorrect, as atrial fibrillation was confirmed in the second note. This leaves Option B as the correct answer: the patient's first recorded instance of atrial fibrillation started during their visit in 2187."
77,2,17412466,What is the patient's state of consciousness and mental status upon discharge as noted on his second visit?,The patient was confused and unable to remember what medications to take.,The patient was in a state of lethargy and exhibited signs of hepatic encephalopathy.,"The patient was mentally clear and coherent, but not very interactive.",The patient was exhibiting symptoms of distress and was coping poorly with his prognosis.,The patient was showing signs of a flat affect due to profound clinical decompensation.,C,"With reference to the ""Discharge Condition"" listed in the second discharge summary (note 2), the patient's mental status upon discharge was ""clear and coherent"" and his level of consciousness was indicated as being ""alert but not very interactive"". Option C accurately mirrors this information. Option A is incorrect as it only refers to his status upon admission, not discharge. Option B is incorrect because it refers to a condition the patient had during his stay, not his state upon discharge. Option D is wrong because it refers to his general affect and emotional state rather than his cognitive state upon discharge. As for Option E, it speaks to the patient's overall clinical prognosis, not his mental and consciousness state at discharge."
78,2,19634294,What medications were stopped during the patient's second visit as mentioned in the note charted on 2174-08-15 and why?,Aspirin was discontinued due to a suspected allergy.,Albuterol Sulfate was stopped because of its ineffective treatment of the patient's wheezing.,Lexapro was discontinued although the reason is not explicitly stated.,Hydrochlorothiazide was stopped to manage the patient's hypokalemia.,Vitamin D was discontinued due to the patient's increased risk of kidney stones.,C,"In the discharge summary dated 2174-08-15, it was stated that Lexapro (escitalopram) was discontinued. Though the reason isn't explicitly provided, this is the only medication that was mentioned as being stopped in the notes from the patient's second visit. Other answer options like Aspirin, Albuterol Sulfate, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Vitamin D were stated to be continued in the same discharge summary. Therefore, these cannot be the right answers."
79,2,11081971,What were the main findings in the renal ultrasound conducted on the patient during her second visit and what was her diagnosis as per the discharge summary charted on 2115-03-06?,The renal ultrasound revealed she had mild left hydronephrosis which resolves postvoid and was diagnosed with a tibial fracture.,The renal ultrasound showed signs of the ovarian cyst and was diagnosed with ovarian cyst.,The patient showed a slightly enlarged spleen in the renal ultrasound and was diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia.,The renal ultrasound showed mild left hydronephrosis that resolves postvoid and she was diagnosed with pyelonephritis.,The renal ultrasound showed abnormalities of her right kidney and was diagnosed with Asthma.,D,"According to the discharge summary charted on 2115-03-06, the findings of the renal ultrasound showed mild left hydronephrosis which resolves postvoid, which aligns with choice D. Also, the patient was diagnosed with pyelonephritis as per the same discharge summary. The other choices mention correct information from the discharge summary, but they do not correctly answer the question. Therefore, only option D correctly answers the question entirely."
80,2,12701907,What was the progression of treatment for the patient's right distal tibia fracture?,The treatment started with oral medications and progressed to surgical procedures.,"The first step of the treatment involved a splint, followed by antibiotics and then surgical intervention.","The patient started with a right ankle external fixator followed by progression to a regular diet and oral medications, and then had a removal of external fixator and open reduction internal fixation surgery.",The patient underwent various surgical procedures without any medication.,"Immediately after the injury, the patient underwent open reduction internal fixation surgery.",C,"Based on the patient's history in both notes, the patient's treatment for the right distal tibia fracture began with a right ankle external fixator as mentioned in 'note 1'. It also mentioned that the patient was initially given Intravenous (IV) fluids and IV pain medications and progressed to a regular diet and oral medication by the post-op day#1. After the first surgery, 'note 2' mentioned that the external fixator was removed and an open reduction internal fixation surgery was performed on the patient. This concludes that choice C is correct.   Option A is not correct because the treatment started with the patient undergoing surgical procedures prior to the administration of oral medications. Option B is not correct as the treatment didn't start with a splint. Option D isn't correct because at the beginning of the treatment, IV fluids and pain medications were administered to the patient before the surgical procedures. Option E isn't correct as it mentioned that the open reduction internal fixation surgery was the immediate action after the injury. According to the notes, this procedure only happened after the external fixator on the right ankle."
81,2,13742684,What changes have been made in the patient's medication regimen between the first and the second hospital admission?,Amlodipine dosage was decreased from 10mg to 5mg.,Trazodone dosage was doubled from 50mg to 100mg.,"Addition of pain, constipation, and nausea medications to the regimen.",The frequency of Pantoprazole administration changed from daily to every 12 hours.,Cessation of Prednisone and Flomax medications.,C,"The question is asking for changes in the patient’s medication regimen during the two hospital stays. In the note 1, there is no mention of pain, constipation, and nausea medications whereas in the note 2, Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Senna, Bisacodyl, and Ondansetron have been added to manage pain, constipation, and nausea. Option A is incorrect because Amlodipine dose remained consistent between the two hospital stays. Option B is incorrect because the dose of Trazodone stays the same in both admissions. Option D is incorrect as Pantoprazole administration frequency is daily in both admissions and Option E is incorrect as Prednisone and Flomax medications are present in the list of discharged medication in both admissions."
82,2,19403719,What was the cause of the post-operative fever during the patient's second hospital visit after the Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH)?,The fever was due to atelectasis or signs of pneumonia.,The fever resulted from an allergic reaction to medications.,The fever was due to a urinary tract infection or inflammation from surgery.,The fever was a result of pulmonary embolism.,The fever was due to an infection in the surgery incision.,C,"During the patient's second hospital visit post-Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH), a raised temperature or fever was reported. According to the discharge summary previously provided, this fever wasn't due to atelectasis or pneumonia as the CXR findings were negative (Option A) and also no allergic reaction to medications had been reported (Option B). An inflammation from the surgery or a urinary tract infection were identified as the most probable causes of the fever (Option C). The summary also rules out pulmonary embolism (Option D), and there was no infection in the surgical incision reported (Option E). Hence, Option C is the correct answer."
83,2,15206416,What were the significant finding from the patient's second hospital admission that led to change in her treatment plan and what was the rationale behind it?,The patient was found to have a slightly elevated WBC count leading to an appendectomy and subsequent treatment with antibiotics.,"The patient's abdominal pain persisted and her stool tested positive for C. difficile, leading to treatment with metronidazole.",The patient was diagnosed with bilateral bad knees leading to a change in her pain medication regime.,Elevated blood glucose levels signified the onset of diabetes and her medication was adjusted accordingly.,"The patient experienced rapid heartbeat, a potential symptom of congestive heart failure, resulting in cardiac medication intervention.",B,"In the second hospital admission note, it is mentioned that the patient's symptoms improved significantly during the admission but her stool was sent for culture and tested positive for C. difficile. As a result, metronidazole was prescribed. Choice A references the findings from the first admission which led to an appendectomy. Although this is somewhat correct, it does not answer the question about the second admission. Choices C, D, and E are incorrect as they contain information either not relevant to the question or not found in the provided notes. The finding of bilateral bad knees is part of the patient's past medical history and does not drive the current treatment plan. The reports of elevated blood glucose levels and rapid heartbeat are not mentioned in the discharge notes."
84,2,13205591,What was the change in the patient's medication list from the first admission on 2188-12-29 to the second admission 2195-01-16?,There was an addition of doxazosin in the patient's medication.,The patient started taking cimetidine.,There was removal of calcium carbonate from the medication list.,Levetiracetam was discontinued.,The patient was no longer taking baclofen.,B,"Between the first admission (2188-12-29) and the second admission (2195-01-16), the new medication that was added to the patient's regimen was cimetidine.  Option A is incorrect as the patient was already taking doxazosin during the first admission.  Option C is incorrect as calcium carbonate was a part of the patient's medication list for both the admissions.  Option D is also wrong because levetiracetam was prescribed during both the admissions. Option E is incorrect as baclofen remains on the list during both admissions."
85,2,14285807,What medical procedure was performed on the patient during their second visit with the indication of abdominal pain and elevated liver function tests (LFTs)?,The patient was treated for hepatic steatosis through medication.,A laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed on the patient.,The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and stone extraction.,The patient underwent a psychiatric evaluation for her depression.,The patient had a surgery for extraction of wisdom teeth.,C,"During the second visit mentioned in note 2, the patient presented with abdominal pain and elevated LFTs and the procedure performed was an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and stone extraction, as clearly indicated in the provided discharge summary. Other options, such as option A, suggesting treatment for hepatic steatosis; option B, indicating a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; option D, implying a psychiatric treatment for depression; and option E, signifying a wisdom teeth extraction are all events or treatments mentioned in the notes but were not the procedure performed during the patient's second visit with abdominal pain and elevated LFTs. Therefore, these are incorrect but serve as plausible distractors."
86,2,12763879,What changes were made to the patient's prescription to manage his orthostatic hypotension and hypertension between his visits in 2161 and 2168?,The medication Irbesartan was increased from 150 mg daily to 37.5 mg daily.,Hydralazine was discontinued and labetalol and amlodipine doses were not changed.,Folic Acid dosage was increased to manage orthostatic hypotension and hypertension.,Calcium Acetate was replaced by a new medication to manage blood pressure.,The medication Labetalol was discontinued.,B,"According to the discharge summaries for 2161 and 2168, the patient was on the same dose of Labetalol and amlodipine on both visits, and Hydralazine was stopped between these visits [2161 (note 1) - hydralazine 25mg four times a day; 2168 (note 2) - hydralazine not listed in the discharge medications]. Therefore, answer B is correct. Answer A is incorrect because the Irbesartan dosage was not increased but decreased from 150mg to 37.5mg. For C, there was no change in Folic Acid dosage to manage orthostatic hypotension and hypertension. For D, Calcium Acetate was not replaced by any new medications for blood pressure management. For E, Labetalol was not discontinued but continued in the same dose. These distractors could be true as the patient had multiple medications, but they are not correct in relation to managing orthostatic hypotension and hypertension."
87,2,19482818,"What were the significant changes noticed in the patient's condition and treatment from her first hospital visit on the 30th of September, 2139 to her second hospital visit on the 21st of October, 2143?","The patient stopped experiencing urinary incontinence, started a new round of cardiac medications, and had a thyroid removal procedure.",The patient underwent surgery for a cervical mediastinoscopy and resumed treatment with Zonegran.,"The patient was diagnosed with a cecal volvulus which required surgical intervention, had a change in her medication regimen, and her previously diagnosed enuresis was no longer a major concern.","The patient experienced increased frequency of seizures, developed a new allergy to a given medication, and started undergoing treatment for colon polyp.","The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer, started new treatment with Tarceva, and had an echocardiogram test.",C,"During the second visit in 2143, the patient was diagnosed with cecal volvulus and underwent surgery for it, there were changes in her admission and discharge medications, and the chief complaint shifted from nocturnal urinary incontinence to abdominal pain, which signifies changes in the patient's condition and treatment approach. Option A is incorrect as the patient didn't stop experiencing urinary incontinence nor underwent thyroid removal and didn't start cardiac medications. B is incorrect as the patient didn’t undergo surgery for cervical mediastinoscopy nor resumed Zonegran treatment.  D is also incorrect because the patient didn’t experience increased seizures, develop a new allergy, or start undergoing treatment for a colon polyp. Option E is incorrect because even though the patient was on Tarceva for metastatic bony lesions from her lung cancer, this was not a new diagnosis nor the chief complaint during the second visit, also there is no mention of an echocardiogram test."
88,2,12326969,"What were the crucial points in the patient's medical history that lead surgeon to consider EVAR, and how the patient had recovered from the procedure as per the discharge summary charted on 2132-05-14?","The patient was diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and underwent EVAR. She further suffered from ischemic colitis and was administered antibiotics. After recovery, she was able to tolerate a regular diet and walk with assistance.","The patient suffered from breast cancer before undergoing EVAR. After the procedure, she did not show any signs of recovery.","The patient was reported to have the prior history of ischemic colitis only, which led to the consideration of EVAR. After the procedure, she was in a critical condition.","The patient was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia, which were reasons for EVAR. Her recovery post-procedure was successful as she resumed her home medications.",The patient's increasing abdominal pain led to the exploration of EVAR. She did not show any signs of recovery after the procedure.,A,"The reason A is the best choice is because it recognizes the patient's rising abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) as the crucial point in her medical history leading to the EVAR procedure. Furthermore, it correctly details her recovery process post-procedure as mentioned in the discharge summary.   Option B fails to acknowledge the AAA as the reason for EVAR while not providing correct information about her recovery. Option C wrongly emphasizes ischemic colitis as the reason for EVAR and provides incorrect information about her post-procedure condition. Option D inaccurately suggests hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia as reasons for EVAR and option E incorrectly suggests the patient's increasing abdominal pain as the primary reason for considering EVAR. Both options D and E further provide incorrect details about her condition post-procedure."
89,2,10618771,"What were the significant improvements in the patient's symptoms and her overall condition during the hospitalization after her ischemic stroke, as per the note charted on 2117-07-12?",The patient's speech and physical mobility improved significantly.,"The patient's blood pressure steadily increased, enhancing cerebral perfusion.",Her aphasic symptoms significantly improved due to intensive speech rehabilitation.,The patient's edema and intracranial pressure were considerably reduced.,The patient showed improved digestive discomfort due to her intake of oral contraceptive pills.,B,"The correct answer is B. As per the note, the patient's symptoms improved due to her blood pressure being raised from low levels (100-110 systolic) to a safer, more stable level (around 120 systolic) without the use of any pressor agents. This improved her cerebral perfusion, aiding her recovery. Though the document mentions several treatments and indications of symptom improvement, this is the one significant improvement that occurred during hospitalization. Option A is incorrect as the patient's speech and weakness improved but did not return back to normal during hospitalization. Option C is incorrect because while speech rehabilitation was recommended, it did not happen during the hospitalization. Similarly, option D is incorrect because the patient didn't have any reported issues with edema and intracranial pressure in the first place. Option E is wrong because this particular symptom pertains to the patient's past bloating discomfort, and not her ischemic stroke."
90,2,18634404,What were the findings of the MCMI-III personality inventory performed on the patient during his stay in 2141-04-13?,"The inventory demonstrated low scores in antisocial traits, ETOH and drug abuse tendencies, anxiety, trauma hx, depressive personality type and a self-defeating personality type.","The inventory found that the patient had extremely high scores in all areas, classifying him as a psychopath.",No MCMI-III personality inventory was performed on the patient.,The MCMI-III personality inventory revealed the patient to be a perfectly healthy individual with no mental health issues.,"The inventory highlighted high scores in self-efficiency, emotional stability, and positivity, indicating a healthy mental state.",A,"The inventory results indicated high scores in the mentioned areas for the patient (antisocial traits, ETOH and drug abuse tendencies, anxiety, trauma hx, depressive personality type, and a self-defeating personality type), suggesting struggles with antisocial behaviors, substance abuse, anxiety, past trauma, a depressive personality, and self-defeating behavior. Answer B is incorrect as the report does not label the patient a psychopath. Answer C is incorrect as the MCMI-III personality inventory was conducted. Answer D and E are incorrect as the inventory did not suggest a mentally healthy individual."
91,2,12949905,What was the patient's diagnosis and medical administration during the last admission to the hospital?,The patient was diagnosed with a cough and underwent a robotic-assisted right lower lobe basal segmentectomy.,The patient was diagnosed with right lower lobe lung cancer and heart enlargement was observed.,"The patient was diagnosed with Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia, and was given Lisinopril and Metoprolol.",The patient was diagnosed with Coronary artery disease and underwent a Coronary artery bypass graft x 4.,The patient was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux and was prescribed ranitidine HCl tablets.,D,"The patient's diagnosis during his last admission was Coronary artery disease, as per note 1, not lung cancer or Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia which were his past medical history. The patient underwent a Coronary artery bypass graft x 4 as a major surgical procedure. Answer choice D is correct, while the rest of the answers are not. Choices A and B are wrong as the patient was not diagnosed with a cough or right lower lobe lung cancer during his last admission but in previous admissions. Choice C is incorrect because the prescriptions relate to his historical health conditions, not the disease in the most recent admission. E is wrong as gastroesophageal reflux was part of his past history, not his latest diagnosis."
92,2,18454397,"What is the patient's renal and cardiac history, including surgical treatments and their current status?","The patient has a history of heart disease, specifically a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI), and has undergone two cardiac catheterizations with drug-eluting stents inserted. As for renal history, a renal mass has been discovered incidentally with a recommendation for further investigation through an MRI assessment.",The patient has a history of renal failure and has undergone dialysis treatments. Their cardiac history includes a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) and two cardiac catheterizations.,"The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, treated with medications. They have undergone a kidney transplant due to renal failure.",The patient has a history of anxiety and migraines and has been managed with medications. Their cardiac history includes a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) treated with medications.,The patient has a history of cardiac arrest treated with a surgical implantation of a pacemaker. Their renal history is unremarkable with no past surgical treatments.,A,"The patient was presented with a history of NSTEMI as indicated in the discharge summary. She has been treated with two cardiac catheterizations where drug-eluting stents were placed for the cardiac issues. On the renal side, a mass in the right kidney was identified incidentally, implying a need for an MRI for further examination (note 1 and 2). Option B incorrectly states the patient has a history of renal failure and dialysis, option C mistakenly states the patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes and kidney transplant, option D wrongly includes anxiety and migraines as a significant part of the cardiac history, and option E inaccurately relates a history of cardiac arrest and pacemaker implementation to the patient."
93,2,12034421,How was acute heart failure managed during the patient's first admission as mentioned in the discharge summary charted on 2166-11-25?,The patient was given Atenelol and Felodipine for her heart failure.,The patient's heart failure was managed through a dietary change.,An emergent permanent pacemaker was implanted in the patient to manage heart failure.,Increased doses of Simvastatin were administered to manage the patient's heart failure.,The patient underwent a surgery to place a stent in her heart to manage heart failure.,C,"According to the discharge summary charted on 2166-11-25, the patient's acute heart failure condition was managed by the implementation of an emergent permanent pacemaker. Therefore, option C is correct. Options A, D, and E are incorrect as Atenelol and Felodipine were adjusted to address a low BP concern, not heart failure (A), Simvastatin was continued for the patient's hyperlipidemia, not for heart failure (D), and there was no mention of a stent placement for heart failure in the given document (E). Option B is not correct as there was no information mentioned regarding a dietary change to manage the patient's heart failure. These incorrect options are plausibly distracting as they are all actions or interventions that are often used in the management of various heart conditions."
94,2,17818938,"What surgical procedure did the patient undergo to manage his erectile dysfunction, and what were the specific discharge instructions related to that particular surgery?",The patient underwent a bypass surgery for his erectile dysfunction and was asked to avoid driving or consuming alcohol for one week post-surgery.,"The patient had an Insertion of an inflatable penile prosthesis and was instructed to gently pull the bulb in the scrotum at least once to twice daily, avoid using the prosthesis for six weeks, complete a 10 day course of antibiotics, and not to immerse the incision in water.",The patient was given a pacemaker and asked to take daily walks and monitor his heart rate.,The patient received a hip replacement surgery and was expected to participate in physical therapy sessions.,The patient was treated for erectile dysfunction through radiotherapy and was guided to maintain a balanced diet and rest properly.,B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient's erectile dysfunction was managed by the insertion of an inflatable penile prosthesis. The discharge instructions for this specific surgery were numerous, including gentle movement of the bulb in the scrotum one to two times daily, not to use the prosthesis for six weeks, to complete a 10 day antibiotics course, and not to immerse the incision in water. Options A, C, D, and E, although mentioned in the notes, are not relevant to the surgical procedure carried out to manage the patient's erectile dysfunction or the related discharge instructions."
95,2,10001217,What were the causative organisms identified from the brain abscess culture during the patient's first admission and what antimicrobial therapy did the patient receive following this information?,The brain abscess culture showed presence of Streptococcus anginosus and the patient was treated with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.,The culture results showed the presence of Pneumococci and the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin.,The culture from brain abscess showed presence of gram positive cocci and the treatment given was Vancomycin and Meropenem.,The abscess culture revealed the causative organism to be E.coli and the patient was treated with Penicillin.,The abcess culture showed Fusobacterium and the treatment given was Ampicillin and Ceftriaxone.,A,"The discharge summary reveals that the brain abscess culture results showed the presence of Streptococcus anginosus as the causative agent. According to the prescribed medication list, the patient was treated with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl following the culture result, the bacteria identified is susceptible to these two antibiotics. Options B,D and E are incorrect as the cultures did not show presence of Pneumococci, E.coli or Fusobacterium, nor was the patient treated with Ciprofloxacin, Penicillin or Ampicillin. C is a distractor as it contains truth, in that vancomycin and meropenem were initially given until cultures were available, but the statement ignores the identification of the final organism and subsequent therapy adjustments."
96,2,14079153,"What was the cause of the patient's worsening pain after his first discharge which led to a second admission to the hospital, and what procedures were carried out during the second admission to resolve this issue?","The cause was the patient's recurrent hypertension, and he was treated with antihypertensive drugs during the second admission.","The patient had an adverse reaction to the medication CeleBREX (celecoxib), and the treatment during the second admission was shifting to another anti-inflammatory drug.","The patient's worsening pain was due to an epidural hematoma after the first surgery, and further lumbar laminectomy and spinal decompression was performed during the second admission.",The patient developed pneumonia and needed IV antibiotics during the second admission.,"The patient's pain was caused by asthma-related issues, and the treatment during the second admission was adjusted asthma medications.",C,"In the second medical note, it's described that the patient experienced increasing pain after the first discharge and was readmitted. An MRI revealed an epidural hematoma and increased lumbar stenosis as the cause of the worsening pain. Therefore, in the second admission a further L2-L4 laminectomy and spinal decompression were performed to treat the issue (choice C). Other choices are not correct as they present different medical conditions or treatment actions that weren't mentioned in the notes as related to the patient's increased pain or the procedures performed during the second admission."
97,2,10324282,What was the patient's main complaint during his second admission to the hospital on 2148-10-05 and how was it managed?,"The patient complained of a fever when they were admitted, and it was managed with stress management interventions.","The patient complained of nausea, and it was dealt with by maintaining dietary restrictions.","The patient was admitted because of severe abdominal cramping, which was treated with painkillers.","The patient complained of severe diarrhea, and it was managed with fluid resuscitation.","The patient expressed concern over sudden weight gain, which was managed by reducing high-calorie foods.",D,"The discharge summary from the patient's second admission on 2148-10-05 (note 2) specifies that the chief complaint was diarrhea. Management included the administration of IV fluids to combat dehydration attributed to excessive bouts of diarrhea. This interpretation rules out answer choices A (fever), B (nausea), C (abdominal cramping), and E (weight gain) as these symptoms are not stated to be the chief complaint during the patient's second admission."
98,2,14608145,What was the nature and resolution of the patient's abdominal pain during her second admission?,The abdominal pain was due to bilateral breast hypertrophy resolved post-operation.,The abdominal pain was due to pneumonia and improved after antibiotic therapy.,The abdominal pain was a consequence of a Right Lower Lobe consolidation.,The abdominal pain was attributed to an elevated troponin level.,The abdominal pain was resulting from abdominal bloating and mild pain associated with anemia.,B,"The patient's abdominal discomfort during her second admission was associated with 1 week of abdominal pain and bloating. It was thought that this was due to Right Lower Lobe pneumonia as her abdominal symptoms resolved following antibiotic therapy (levofloxacin 750mg daily) and she was able to eat a full diet by the time of her discharge. The options A, C, D, and E are good distractors as they include other symptoms or conditions the patient experienced during her admissions but they were not the cause of her abdominal pain during her second admission."
99,2,11871035,"How did the patient's kidney function evolve throughout her treatment, and which factors likely contributed to this evolution?",The patient's kidney function showed a slight progressive deterioration after a right VATs lower lobectomy operation.,"The patient's kidney function deteriorated following a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia which required the administration of multiple nephrotoxic anti-infectives, exacerbating an earlier instance of uric acid nephropathy.",The kidney function of the patient improved significantly after the removal of a right-sided lung nodule.,The patient's kidney function remained stable throughout her treatment for lung cancer and was unaffected by her medications.,"The operations and medications from her past medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, have significantly improved the patient's kidney function over time.",B,"The patient's kidney function went through a progressive deterioration following her diagnosis and treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia. Initially, her kidney function improved after the episode of uric acid nephropathy. However, during her leukemia treatment, she had to be administered multiple nephrotoxic anti-infectives as a response to being febrile neutropenic. Other nephrotoxic drugs were held, but her kidney function continued to deteriorate. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect as they either imply the kidney function improved or remained stable, or attribute the changes in kidney function to incorrect causes based on the information provided in the medical notes."
100,2,16399934,What was the procedure carried out to manage the invasive squamous cell carcinoma on the patient's right shin during his second visit?,Surgical removal of lymph nodes in the groin area,A dental extraction to remove an infected tooth,A treatment with antibiotics and antiviral drugs,Wide excision of the carcinoma along with a skin graft,Routine examination and monitoring with noninvasive methods,D,"The data from note 2 indicates that the patient underwent ""wide excision right groin, sentinel lymph node biopsy, split-thickness skin graft,"" which was performed to manage the squamous cell carcinoma on his right shin. This makes D the correct answer. Option A only mentions a part of the procedures, which doesn't give the complete answer. B is incorrect because the dental extraction was related to a separate condition (odontogenic infection) disclosed in note 1. C is also incorrect since the patient's treatment included a surgical procedure and not just medical therapy. The treatment was more than just a routine examination and monitoring mentioned in E."
101,2,15582213,What modifications were made to the patient's diabetes management due to her hypoglycemia during her two hospital admissions?,The patient's medication was switched from insulin to oral hypoglycemic drugs.,The patient was instructed to decrease her usual lantus insulin dose from 8 units twice daily to 4 units twice daily.,The patient's humalog insulin was completely discontinued.,The patient was asked to increase her dosage of insulin to manage her hypoglycemia.,No changes were made in the patient's diabetes management.,B,"The correct answer is B. From the information in the notes, the patient's lantus insulin dose was decreased from 8 units twice a day to 4 units twice a day during the first hospital admission because of her decreased oral intake and recurrent hypoglycemia. In the second hospital admission, it is noted that the dose was further refined to 9 units in the morning and 4 units in the evening. Answer A is incorrect because the patient was never switched to oral hypoglycemic drugs. Answer C is incorrect as the notes mention that her humalog insulin was altered, but never discontinued. Answer D is incorrect because her insulin dose was decreased, not increased. Answer E is incorrect because modifications were definitely made to the patient's insulin regimen due to her hypoglycemia."
102,2,15367259,What is the dosage of enoxaparin prescribed to the patient on discharge according to the second discharge summary and how does it differ from the first discharge summary?,"The dosage of enoxaparin prescribed to the patient on discharge according to the second discharge summary is 40 mg/0.4 mL subcutaneously daily for 4 weeks, which is similar to the first discharge summary.","The dosage of enoxaparin prescribed to the patient on discharge according to the second discharge summary is 40 mg/0.4 mL subcutaneously once a day at bedtime for 5 days, which is less frequently than the 4 weeks daily dosage in the first discharge summary.","The dosage of enoxaparin prescribed to the patient on discharge according to the second discharge summary is 90 mg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Q6H, which is less frequently than the 4 weeks daily dosage in the first discharge summary.","The dosage of enoxaparin prescribed to the patient on discharge according to the second discharge summary is 100 mg per capsule two times a day for 3 weeks, which is less frequently than the 4 weeks daily dosage in the first discharge summary.","The dosage of enoxaparin prescribed to the patient on discharge according to the second discharge summary is 325 mg tablets two times a day every 6 hours, which is more frequently than the 4 weeks daily dosage in the first discharge summary.",B,"The correct answer is B because according to the second discharge summary, the patient is prescribed enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL subcutaneously once a day at bedtime for 5 days. This differs from the first discharge summary where the enoxaparin was prescribed for daily use for 4 weeks. Options C, D, and E are incorrect as they don't pertain to the medication enoxaparin, but to other medications prescribed to the patient. Option A is incorrect as it inaccurately states that the dosages prescribed in the two summaries are the same."
103,2,19781142,What was the cause of the patient's abdominal distention and worsening shortness of breath during her first admission as per the note charted on 2126-01-26 and what treatment was administered?,The patient's abdominal distention and worsening shortness of breath were due to metastatic breast cancer in liver/bone that caused developing of tense ascites. The patient was treated with the medication furosemide and lassix.,The patient's abdominal distention and worsening shortness of breath were due to a urinary tract infection and she was put on antibiotics.,"The patient's abdominal distention and worsening shortness of breath were due to a sinus infection, and she was given nasal sprays and steroids.",The patient's abdominal distention and worsening shortness of breath were due to liver failure and she was put on a liver transplant waiting list.,The patient's abdominal distention and worsening shortness of breath were due to pneumonia and she was treated with oral antibiotics.,A,"The medical records from 2126-01-26 indicate that the patient was suffering from abdominal distension and shortness of breath due to metastatic breast cancer in her liver and bone, resulting in tense ascites. The treatment plan included paracentesis and adjustment of her medication. The patient was given fresh frozen plasma prior to her paracentesis due to her INR index, and continued her medication Coumadin afterwards. Lasix was also administered, and her home dosage was adjusted. Choices B, C, D, and E mention different conditions and treatments that were not specified in the said medical records, making them false distractors for this question."
104,2,16714362,What allergic reaction does the patient have and what major surgical procedures has she undergone according to the discharge summaries?,The patient is allergic to penicillin and has undergone a partial gastrectomy.,The patient is allergic to atenolol and has undergone a gastric outlet operation.,The patient is allergic to oxycodone and has undergone knee surgery.,The patient is allergic to docusate sodium and has undergone an operation for a patella fracture.,The patient is allergic to diazepam and has undergone a heart surgery.,A,"According to the discharge summaries, the patient is allergic to penicillins. She has undergone several major surgical procedures including ORIF Left patella fracture as mentioned in the first note and Distal partial gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy (Billroth II) as mentioned in the second note. The other options are not correct because those allergies and procedures are not stated in the given notes. With some choices mentioning incorrect allergies or surgical procedures undergone by the patient, this makes for effective distractors."
105,2,11039251,What was the significant change in the patient's medications during the two visits and why?,The patient stopped taking loratadine between two visits due to the management of a new allergy.,The patient was given Cipro between two visits due to an incidence of Urinary Tract Infection.,The patient was prescribed Foradil Aerolizer during the second visit due to worsening COPD.,Lasix was prescribed between two visits to manage fluid overload condition.,Albuterol was discontinued during the second visit due to reduction in the symptoms of shortness of breath.,D,"The correct answer is D, as the discharge summary from the second visit mentions the introduction of Lasix (furosemide) for managing fluid overload, which wasn't part of the patient's medications on the first visit. The other options, A, B, C, and E are incorrect. In option A, Loratadine was a constant in both visits, while in option B, Cipro was indicated as finished and not sent out during the second discharge. Option C is incorrect as Foradil Aerosolizer was included in both discharges. Option E is wrong, as Albuterol was continued between two visits."
106,2,14680532,What is the primary reason for the patient's second admission to the hospital according to the note charted on 2140-06-23?,The patient had a mechanical fall leading to an injury in her left arm.,The patient has been experiencing urinary tract infection symptoms.,The patient agreed to go to rehabilitation as she realized her inability to transfer from bed to wheelchair.,The patient was struggling with severe anemia.,The patient had dermatological issues as she was found covered in urine.,C,"The patient being admitted for the second time, as per the note charted on 2140-06-23, was primarily due to her understanding that she could not safely move from her bed to her wheelchair, and agreed to go to rehab for assistance. Option A was the reason for her first admission, not the second. Although the patient had symptoms of a urinary tract infection (Option B), it was not the primary reason for admission. Her anemia (Option D) was a condition managed during her admission but was not the reason she was admitted. Option E is incorrect as during her second admission, she had not urinated frequently, but this was not the cause for her admission."
107,2,14329908,"What were the clinical presentations concerning the patient's severe hiatal hernia and what were the treatment steps taken based on the medical history, clinical findings, and related interventions?","The patient presented with episodes of coffee ground emesis, diffuse esophagitis, and patches of black discoloration in the esophagus. The treatment included abdominal surgery, a liquid diet, and continuous intake of pain medications.","The patient came in with a chief complaint of hiatal hernia, accompanied by symptoms like vomiting blood and esophagitis. The chosen treatment steps involved a laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair operation followed by medication and diet adjustments.","The patient's symptoms were hematemesis and paraesophageal hiatal hernia which persisted despite medication. Intervention then followed with a surgical operation, laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair.","The patient came in for gastric ulcers and abdominal pain. The treatment was the administration of medications, followed by minor surgical procedures.","The patient reported experiencing nausea and dizziness, which were indicative of severe hiatal hernia. The treatment involved medication administration and close monitoring over time.",B,"The patient did present with coffee ground emesis, diffuse esophagitis, and black discoloration in the esophagus. However, instead of abdominal surgery, a laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair was done (option A). The patient did not come in for gastric ulcers or abdominal pain; these were part of the patient's medical history (option D). The patient also didn't complain of dizziness (option E). The symptoms presented in option C are partly correct, but the treatment included more than just the surgical operation. Option B accurately presents both the clinical signs and treatment steps taken."
108,2,16728260,"What was the main cause of the patient's recurrent abdominal pain, intractable nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, and how was it managed?",The primary cause was an ulcerative colitis and the patient was managed with Prednisone and sucralfate.,"The patient had a hernia causing her recurrent symptoms, which was managed with a diet and follow-up with gastroenterologist.","The main reason for the patient's symptoms was an active CDIFF infection, which was treated with a 10 day course of oral vancomycin and supportive measures including fluid replacement, pain management, and antiemetics.",The cause was an unidentified inflammatory disease managed with a steroid responsive process which was concluded with a colonoscopy.,"The patient was suffering from pancreatitis, which was managed with a diet and medications for pancreatitis.",C,"In the summary, it is noted that the patient had a CDIFF infection and that the symptoms were suggestive of an active CDIFF infection. Although there was initially uncertainty about whether the CDIFF was causing her symptoms, the decision was still made to treat her for CDIFF with oral vancomycin. Other care measures included fluid replacement, antiemetics for nausea, and managing her pain with medication. Option A is incorrect because even though the patient was initially placed on Prednisone and sucralfate for an ulcer, it is reported that no active ulcers were found upon investigation. The same applies to option B; while a hernia was initially suggested as a possible cause, no supporting evidence was found. Option D mentions an unidentified inflammatory disease as the cause, but while the doctors noted the CRP was normal, making severe inflammatory disease less likely. Lastly, option E is incorrect because there is no mention of pancreatitis at all in the patient's summary."
109,2,18633146,What was the primary cause of the patient's readmission to the hospital on 2195-04-24 and how was it managed during the hospital stay?,The patient was readmitted due to progressive ischemia and was managed with L carotid to subclavian transposition surgical procedure.,The patient was readmitted due to swelling of the left leg and was managed by leg elevation and regular check up.,"The patient was readmitted due to a syncope episode and recurrent falls; management involved intravenous fluids, physical therapy and monitoring for abnormal heart rhythm.","The patient was readmitted due to rheumatoid arthritis exacerbation, and was managed with Methotrexate.","The patient was readmitted due to GI bleed, which was managed with close monitoring and dietary adjustments.",C,"The patient in note 2 was readmitted to the hospital due to a syncope episode and recurrent falls. This is the reason for his admission rather than issues related to ischemia, leg swelling, rheumatoid arthritis, or GI bleed. The management during the hospital stay included administering intravenous fluids to improve symptoms of orthostasis, monitoring the heart rhythm for any abnormality and involvement of physical therapy. Though Choices A, D, E are based on information contained within the patients' notes, none are the primary cause of the readmission on 2195-04-24, and thus are incorrect. Although swelling management techniques were mentioned in the patient's discharge instructions in note 1, there's no evidence of the patient being readmitted due to leg swelling in note 2, making choice B incorrect."
110,2,14980590,What changes were made to patient's immunosuppressive medications prior to each hernia repair surgeries?,The patient's medication was switched from Myfortic to Prograf before the surgeries.,Tacrolimus was replaced with Rapamune before the surgeries.,"Before both surgeries, Rapamune was replaced with Tacrolimus.",No changes were made to the patient's immunosuppressive medications before the surgeries.,The patient's immunosuppressive medication was discontinued before the surgeries.,C,"The provided notes mention that before both hernia repair surgeries, the patient's immunosuppressive medication was switched from Rapamune to Tacrolimus (note 1: ""...Note, the patient had been maintained on Rapamune, which was changed over to tacrolimus prior to repair."" and note 2: ""...Of note, he is maintained on Rapamune due to poor renal function on tacrolimus. Patient was transitioned off Rapamune about 3 weeks ago, and is currently on tacrolimus.""). Various indications about the other medications mentioned in the alternatives A, B, D, and E can be found in the notes, but none describe a change in the patient's immunosuppressive drugs in the context of their surgical procedures."
111,2,16993512,What surgical procedures did the patient undergo in her two admissions and what were the reasons for those procedures?,"In the first admission, the patient underwent laparoscopy due to nausea and vomiting. In the second admission, she underwent trachelectomy due to the persistent inability to tolerate food orally.","In both admissions, the patient underwent a UAE consult because of the size of her uterine fibroids.","Supracervical Hysterectomy was performed during the first admission because of menorrhagia and uterine fibroids. In the second admission, she was treated for nausea and vomiting post surgery but no surgery was performed.","In the first admission, the patient had laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies, trachelectomy, limited diagnostic cystoscopy because of pelvic pain and a cervical fibroid. In the second admission, she was treated for nausea/vomiting but no surgery was undertaken.","The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy in her first admission due to her options being explored. In the second admission, she didn't undergo any surgeries because her conditions have improved.",D,"- Option A: The patient had laparoscopy during her second admission, not the first one, due to pelvic pain and a cervical fibroid. Also, trachelectomy operation wasn't done because of her inability to tolerate PO but due to pelvic pain and a cervical fibroid. - Option B: The patient had a UAE consult examination in her first admission, but she didn't have it in her second one. - Option C: No surgery was performed during the second admission. - Option D: All the information here is correct. The patient had a Supracervical Hysterectomy during the first admission due to menorrhagia and uterine fibroids. During the second admission, she had laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies, trachelectomy, a limited diagnostic cystoscopy due to pelvic pain and a cervical fibroid but not due to nausea/vomiting. - Option E: The exploratory laparotomy wasn't one of the surgeries the patient undergoes in her admissions."
112,2,17962792,What were the major surgical procedures performed for this patient and what was the primary diagnostic condition for both procedures?,The patient underwent a robot-assisted laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy and an open kidney transplant due to renal cell carcinoma.,Procedures performed were laparoscopic left renal cyst decortication and full kidney removal owing to uncontrolled hyperglycemia.,The patient had a right robot-assisted laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy and a laparoscopic right renal cyst decortication due to a right renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma.,The surgeries involved hemodialysis treatment and laparoscopic right renal cyst decortication on account of acute nephritis.,A laparoscopic adrenalectomy and robot-assisted laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy were performed as the patient had acute abdominal pain and persistent vomiting.,C,"In note 1, it is mentioned that the patient underwent a robot-assisted laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy and a laparoscopic right renal cyst decortication. The condition these procedures were for is mentioned as the right renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, option C is correct.  Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they describe medical procedures and conditions not consistent with the ones from the notes. A - Open kidney transplant and renal cell carcinoma weren’t mentioned in the notes. B - A left renal cyst decortication wasn’t performed and the patient doesn’t have uncontrolled hyperglycemia. D - No dialysis was performed nor was acute nephritis diagnosed. E - The patient didn’t undergo an adrenalectomy nor were abdominal pain and persistent vomiting mentioned. They are good distractors because they refer to plausible medical procedures and conditions related to the urology field, thus requiring careful reading of the patient's notes."
113,2,16118306,"What surgical procedure was done for the patient during her first hospital visit, and what was discovered during surgery?",The patient underwent a cesarean section where it was discovered that she had an ovarian torsion.,"The patient had an exploratory laparoscopy performed, where it was found that she had normal-appearing tubes and ovaries, a normal appendix, and a uterus of the size consistent with a 17-week pregnancy.","The patient went through a hysterectomy operation, and doctors found a large, edematous right ovary.","The doctors performed a laparotomy on the patient, and identified dilated, engorged blood vessels on the right aspect of the uterus' fundus.","The patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery, with a finding of leukocytosis.",B,"In the first hospital visit, patient underwent an exploratory laparoscopy (as mentioned in the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section of note 1), findings of which included normal-appearing tubes and ovaries, a normal appendix, and a uterus of the size consistent with a 17-week pregnancy (as specified in the 'Brief Hospital Course' section of note 1). Options A, C, D and E are incorrect because cesarean section, hysterectomy, laparotomy and spontaneous vaginal delivery were not performed on the patient during her first hospital visit and the corresponding findings mentioned in these options were also not discovered during the first hospital visit."
114,2,11823339,"What was the cause of the swelling in the patient's neck, as documented in the second note and what was the treatment approach?",The patient had an incisional hernia that was treated through laparoscopic hernia repair.,"The patient's neck swelling was due to a staphylococcus infection or abscess and was treated with an incision, drainage, and antibiotics.","The patient's neck swelling was due to a pneumonia infection, and was treated with immunizations.",The patient's swelling was a result of hypertension and managed through daily medication.,"The patient had photosensitivity that caused the swelling, managed through avoidance of sun exposure.",B,"The second note indicates a diagnosis of 'abscess/phlegmon, posterior neck'. This indicates an infective cause of the swelling, with mention of a staph infection in the discharge instructions, though the exact organism is not clarified in the note. The treatment involved an Incision and Drainage (I&D) procedure, along with antibiotics, as evidenced by 'sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim' and 'cephalexin' in the discharge medications.  Choices A, C, D, and E are incorrect. Although they are mentioned within the discharge reports, they are not directly related to the question inquiring about the cause and treatment of the neck swelling."
115,2,16332808,What were the discharge medications prescribed to the patient after the second hospital visit and did they change from the first visit?,"The patient was given Keppra, Acetaminophen, Bisacodyl, Docusate Sodium, Levetiracetam, Oxycodone, and Senna.",The patient was only prescribed LevETIRAcetam 250 mg PO BID and Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN fever or pain after the second visit.,The discharge medications were the same during the first and second hospital visits.,The patient was given Keppra 250mg bid and Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H: PRN fever or pain after the second visit.,"The patient was discharged with LevETIRAcetam 250mg PO BID, Oxycodone, Bisacodyl and Senna during the first visit.",A,"The correct answer is A because after the second hospital visit, the discharge medications included Keppra, Acetaminophen, Bisacodyl, Docusate Sodium, Levetiracetam, Oxycodone and Senna, as stated in the discharge note 2. This is a change from the first hospital visit where the discharge medications were only LevETIRAcetam 250 mg PO BID and Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H: PRN fever or pain (note 1).  Option B is incorrect as it excludes Bisacodyl, Docusate Sodium, Oxycodone, and Senna from the list of drugs. Option C is false since the discharge medications indeed changed between the first and second visits. Similarly, option D is incorrect because it is missing several medicines prescribed on discharge after the second hospital visit. Option E is incorrect as it says that the Oxycodone, Bisacodyl, and Senna medicines were given on the first hospital visit which is not true as per the provided notes."
116,2,11102902,What were the reasons for the patient's previous admissions and what were the major surgical procedures performed during each?,The patient was admitted for hypertension and underwent a tonsillectomy.,"The patient was admitted due to left hip implant failure along with the sudden dissociation of prothesis and underwent a revision of her left total hip replacement during the first admission. During the second admission, the patient suffered from severe degenerative changes in her right hip and underwent a right total hip arthroplasty.",The patient was admitted for thyroid-related issues and underwent treatment for hypothyroidism.,The patient was admitted due to high cholesterol and underwent treatment for hypercholesterolaemia.,The patient was admitted for tonsil issues and underwent an appendectomy.,B,"The answer choice B is correct because it accurately answers the doctor's question based on the information provided in the notes. According to [note 1], the patient was admitted due to a failure in her left hip implant, which resulted in the sudden dissociation of the prothesis, leading to a revision of her left total hip replacement. In [note 2], the patient was admitted due to degenerative changes in her right hip and underwent a right total hip arthroplasty. The other answer choices (A, C, D, E) are incorrect because they either mention incorrect reasoning for the admission or misrepresent the surgeries undergone, according to the provided discharge summaries."
117,2,11771886,"What major surgical or invasive procedure was conducted during the patient's second visit and what post-operative complications, if any, did the patient face?","During the patient's second visit, she underwent a total thyroidectomy without any post-operative complications.","For the patient's second visit, a total thyroidectomy was performed with post-operative complications like vertigo and GERD.",The patient's second visit involved a completion thyroidectomy and no post-operative complications occurred.,"On her second visit, the patient underwent a robotic supracervical hysterectomy as well as a sacral colpopexy. She experienced difficulty urinating post-operatively.","During the patient's second trip, she had a robotic supracervical hysterectomy with postoperative complications such as severe abdominal pain and swelling.",D,"According to note 2, the patient's second visit involved a robotic supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sacral colpopexy, TVT, posterior colporrhaphy, and a cystoscopy. The note also confirms that she had difficulty urinating post-operatively (as indicated by the need for a Foley catheter), thus making option D the correct choice.  Options A and B incorrectly attribute the completion thyroidectomy to the second visit, which, according to the notes, is from the patient's first visit. Equally, they mention complications that weren't listed on the notes for the second visit. Option C inaccurately presents the thyroidectomy as the surgical process from the second visit. Lastly, option E suggests a postoperative complaint (severe abdominal pain and swelling) which was not mentioned in note 2."
118,2,18207779,What was the recommendation following the patient's hospital readmission for increasing pain that was unresponsive to medication despite having undergone an L5 laminectomy previously?,The patient was advised to continue with their current pain medication regimen and see a physiotherapist.,The physician recommended an additional surgery to improve the patient's condition.,The doctors suggested the patient start a new therapy routine on their own at home.,The treating team advised the patient to strictly control his diet and exercise regularly.,The patient was told to avoid lifting any heavy objects and maintain bed rest.,B,"The correct answer is B because during the patient's second admission after the first L5 laminectomy it's mentioned that the pain was not responding to medications and ""on ___, patient underwent L3-S1 decompressive laminectomy"" which means a second surgery was done to alleviate the pain. The other options are incorrect, although they were mentioned in the notes, they were not the main action taken following the patient's readmission for uncontrolled pain. Option A is wrong because though the patient was on a pain medication regimen, it wasn't controlling the pain hence the second surgery. Option C is incorrect because self-therapy at home wasn't suggested by the doctors. Option D appears in the notes under discharge instructions but was not the main action taken for the unresponsive pain. Option E is stated in the notes but it was given as part of the discharge instructions after surgery and not as the main solution to the unmanaged pain."
119,2,15479525,What are the changes made to the patient's medication regimen upon his last discharge compared to his previous discharge?,The patient was prescribed Muscle relaxants upon last discharge.,Diovan was added to the patient's medication regimen upon last discharge.,The patient was given Oxycodone and Colace upon his last discharge.,The patient was prescribed psychiatric medications upon last discharge.,Antihistamines were added to the patient's medication regimen upon last discharge.,C,"Upon the patient's last discharge, Oxycodone 5 mg and Colace 100 mg were added to his medication regimen, which were not present in his previous discharge. Although other medications were added, such as Cipro, this wasn't a permanent addition as it was only for 5 days. The incorrect answers are good distractors as they mention medicines or medicine classes but not ones that are mentioned in the discharge summaries provided. Combined with the patient's extensive medication regimen from previous discharges, it can be confusing to keep track of which medicines were prescribed upon the last discharge."
120,2,11550263,"What was the suspected cause of the patient's symptoms at each of her two hospital visits on 2184-02-14 and 2189-05-13, and how were they managed?",The patient was suspected to have viral meningitis during her first visit and stomach ulcer during her second visit. They were managed with analgesics and antacids.,"Aseptic Meningitis was suspected during her first visit and was managed with pain relief and hydration. On the second visit, food poisoning was suspected and the patient was provided fluid administration.","On her first visit, the patient was thought to have a migraine which was managed with anti-inflammatory drugs. On her second visit, she was suspected to have food poisoning and was given intravenous fluids.",The patient's symptoms during the first visit were suspected to be asthmatic attacks managed by bronchodilators. The second visit's symptoms were suspected to be a stomach infection managed by antibiotics.,The patient was suspected cases of appendicitis in both visits. They were managed through analgesics and surgical consulting.,B,"On the patient's first visit the notes indicated that she was suspected of having Aseptic Meningitis which was managed with pain control and fluids noted in the discharge summary. For the second visit, based on the history and brief hospital course, the healthcare provider suspected food poisoning, and it was managed by fluid administration. Though options A, C, D, and E contain elements of truth from the provided information, they do not correctly answer the question regarding the cause of the patient's symptoms during the two hospital visits and their management."
121,2,18503592,What is the medical history of the patient including surgical procedures?,The patient underwent right L4 laminotomy.,The patient does not have any medical history.,"She has a medical history of fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, and inflammatory bowel disease.",The patient had left L5 radiculopathy followed by left L5 laminectomy.,The patient has never undergone any surgical procedure.,C,"In the discharge summaries, it is stated that the patient has a record of illnesses that include fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, and inflammatory bowel disease. This makes option C the correct answer. Option A is incorrect as the surgery the patient underwent was a right L5 laminectomy, not an L4 laminotomy as mentioned. Option B misrepresents the notes as the patient does have a considerable medical and surgical history. Option D is incorrect because the patient's issue was with the right side (L4-L5 disc herniation, Right L5 radiculopathy), not the left. Option E is inaccurate because the patient has clearly undergone multiple surgical procedures, including a right L5 laminectomy, L4-5 discectomy, IDET, two times rhizotomy, cortisone injections, bursal shots, and Botox in the neck."
122,2,15111504,Did the patient had any surgical intervention for his condition of perforated appendicitis during his first hospital visit or was this discussed during his second visit?,The patient underwent surgery for his perforated appendicitis condition during his first admission.,The treatment plan for perforated appendicitis for the patient included surgery during the first hospital visit.,A surgical intervention for the perforated appendicitis condition was carried out during the patient's second hospital visit.,The patient went through a surgical procedure for a different condition during his first hospital visit.,An interval appendectomy was discussed for future consideration during the patient's second hospital visit.,E,"Answer choice E is correct. In the course of the second hospital visit, an interval appendectomy was discussed for potential future consideration. This is evident from the last paragraph of the 'Brief Hospital Course' in note 2, while there was no surgical intervention carried out during either the first or the second visit. Choices A, B, C, and D are incorrect because during both hospital visits, no surgical intervention took place in response to the patient's perforated appendicitis condition, evidenced by 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None' in both notes."
123,2,17382208,What was the result of the patient's pathology report following her left total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy noted in the discharge summary on 2125-09-20?,"The pathology report showed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, ER/PR positive, HER2 negative.",The report showed signs of syncope due to dehydration.,The report confirmed the presence of a partial mastectomy with left axillary lymph node biopsy.,The report detailed the presence of RA and HLD.,The pathology report was pending at the time of discharge.,E,"The correct answer is E because, per the discharge summary, the pathology report was still pending at the time of discharge. Answer choice A is incorrect because it describes the results of a biopsy, and not the pathology report. Answer B is not correct because it describes a diagnosis made during another admission and not the outcome of the mentioned pathology report. Answer C is only describing a prior surgical procedure, not the results of the pathology report following another surgery. Answer D is not accurate because it refers to the patient's medical history, not the result of the pathology report. These are good distractors because they refer to other medical details present in the patient's notes."
124,2,10404814,What is the source of sudden shortness of breath and tongue swelling incident post the repair of a recurrent Zenker's diverticulum in our patient with a previous documented history of angioedema?,The patient has a new allergy to a medicine introduced during hospitalization.,The shortness of breath and tongue swelling is a postoperative complication of the Zenker's diverticulum repair.,The patient was exposed to a known allergen in the hospital which triggered the angioedema.,The patient's angioedema was triggered by a reaction to an antibiotic administered postoperatively.,"The patient's angioedema was spontaneously triggered, with no identifiable cause.",D,"The discharge summary in note 2 reports that the patient developed tongue swelling associated with the administration of Unasyn, an antibiotic, after the surgery. This was most likely an angioedema reaction triggered by the medication. Options A are not correct as no new allergies were identified during the hospitalization. Option B is incorrect since there's no evidence in the discharge summaries to suggest that the Zenker's diverticulum repair itself was the cause of the angioedema. Option C and E are incorrect as it is specifically reported that the angioedema incident was temporally related to Unasyn administration, making it the most probable cause."
125,2,11158071,"What was the primary discharge diagnosis from the patient's second admission on February 26, 2132?",Influential colitis,Omental infarction,Severe constipation,Small bowel inflammation,Myotonic dystrophy,B,"The primary discharge diagnosis from the patient's second admission on February 26, 2132, was an ""Omental infarction"" as listed under 'Discharge Diagnosis' in note 2. Incorrect choices A, C, D, and E are effective distractors because although these health conditions appear in note 2, they were either a symptom the patient was experiencing or part of the patient's extensive medical history and were not the primary discharge diagnosis."
126,2,10146033,What was the patient's blood uric acid level on his first admission?,Uric Acid level was 8.1,Uric Acid level was 6.8,Uric Acid level was 7.1,Uric Acid level was 9.6,Uric Acid level was 7.5,C,"In note 1, it is mentioned that the uric acid level was 7.1. Choices A, B, D, and E are incorrect although they could be perceived as believable distractors because they fall within the general range of uric acid levels. However, they don't reflect the precise data from the note. Choice C is the correct answer because it matches the data from the care note. This demonstrates the necessity of preciseness in reviewing and assimilating clinical data."
127,2,11465117,What is the final diagnosis and the recommended treatment for the patient mentioned in the note charted on '2169-10-08' ?,The final diagnosis is intestinal obstruction and the recommended treatment is implementation of a Fentanyl patch and pain medication as needed.,The patient was diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma and postoperative ileus and the treatment suggested involved high-dose antibiotics and ureteral stent placement.,"The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease, and was recommended a treatment plan involving proton pump inhibitors and dietary adjustments.","The conclusion is that the patient has MALT lymphoma, and she was advised to proceed with radiation therapy.","The patient was diagnosed with breast microcalcs (benign), and suggested treatment was routine monitoring and assessment.",A,"In the note from '2169-10-08', the final diagnosis for the patient is metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and intestinal obstruction. The recommended treatment, based on the discharge instructions, was to implement a Fentanyl patch and monitor the pain carefully, allowing for self-reported adjustments in the medication regimen. B is incorrect because while ureteral stent placement was mentioned in the note, it was not part of the final treatment recommendations. The diagnoses in options C, D, and E, while listed in the patient's medical history, were not the primary issues mentioned in the note from the mentioned chartdate. These options were all mentioned in the patient's medical history which makes them suitable distractors."
128,2,12699594,What is the final treatment plan for the patient's left heel wound post-debridement and discharge from the hospital?,"Continue administration of daily IV Vancomycin, engage in weight bearing and physical activities depending on tolerance in lower extremities.",Stop all medication treatments and switch to natural herbal remedies.,Discontinue intake of blood thinners such as Coumadin and increase fluid intake to hasten healing of the wound.,Start a high-protein diet to facilitate skin regeneration and perform regular wound cleaning with saline solution.,Immobilize the foot and abstain from physical activity completely to hasten healing of the wound.,A,"The correct answer is shared within the discharge instructions of the summary note 1. It asks the patient to continue with the administration of daily IV Vancomycin as well as to be weight-bearing and continue activities as tolerated in both lower extremities. Option B is incorrect since there is no mention of stopping medications and switching to herbal remedies. Option C is also incorrect as there is no advice for discontinuing the use of blood thinners like Coumadin and increasing fluid intake. Answer D is inaccurate as high-protein diet is not prescribed and saline solution for wound cleansing is not mentioned. Lastly, option E is incorrect due to evidence in the notes suggesting patient be weight bearing and continue with physical activities as tolerated, not to immobile the foot."
129,2,18480730,"What procedures were done on the patient during her first hospital stay to address her Liver Laceration, Splenic laceration and Left Tibia Fracture, and what was her condition at the time of discharge?","The patient underwent a laparoscopic liver resection, splenic repair and surgical fixation of left tibia, and was discharged in stable condition.","The patient received exploratory laparotomy with packing, intramedullary nail for the left tibia, and was stable when discharged.","The patient had an abdominal washout and draining, exploratory laparotomy with closure and surgical penciling of left tibia, and was in critical condition at discharge.","The patient underwent angiogram, exploratory laparotomy, temporary abdominal closure, and left tibial fracture repair, and was stable at discharge.","The patient had a liver transplantation, splenectomy and left tibia fracture reduction, and was in a life-threatening condition at discharge.",B,"The discharge summary under note 1 confirms that the patient underwent several procedures for her liver lacerations, splenic laceration and left tibia fracture. These included exploratory laparotomies with packing, closure, and a washout and dressing change, as well as the insertion of an intramedullary nail in the left tibia. At discharge, the patient was in a stable state, as she was able to ambulate and control her pain. Options A, C, D, and E all include procedures not mentioned in the patient's notes or incorrect status at discharge, making B the correct answer. However, these options serve as good distractors as they include elements of the patient's treatment (e.g. laparotomy or tibia fracture repair)."
130,2,10846378,What was the complication reported on pod#1 during the patient's first admission and what treatment was administered to address it?,The patient had a skin reaction to the medications and was given corticosteroids,The patient had calf tenderness along with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower leg and was commenced on Xarelto and Aspirin was discontinued.,The patient experienced chest pressure and was treated with beta-blockers,The patient got an infection post-surgery and was given antibiotics for treatment.,The patient had high blood pressure and was given antihypertensive drugs.,B,"Based on the 'discharge summary' in the notes, on post-operation day 1 the patient reported calf tenderness and an ultrasound revealed a partial deep vein thrombosis in the right lower extremity. The Hematology department was consulted and the patient was started on Xarelto (anticoagulant) 15 mg twice daily. Aspirin, which the patient was on for DVT prevention, was discontinued at this time. Options A, C, D, E are incorrect but good distractors as they all refer to other complications that could occur in this type of patients, but they are not mentioned in the 'discharge summary' as actually occurring. This makes them incorrect for this particular question."
131,2,14932945,What was the treatment provided for the patient's left breast cellulitis during her second admission and what were the medications prescribed at discharge?,The patient was treated with vancomycin upon her admission and prescribed Dilaudid IV/PCA at discharge.,"Upon her second admission, the patient underwent a bilateral tissue immediate tissue expander placement and was prescribed Oxycodone-Acetaminophen at discharge.","The patient was given vancomycin and cipro upon admission and was discharged with prescriptions for Ciprofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, and Ondansetron.","The patient received IV clindamycin and upon discharge, she was given Bisacodyl and Senna.","During her second admission, the patient received bilateral total mastectomy with right level I and II axillary lymph node dissection and was prescribed Clindamycin HCl at discharge.",C,"Option C is correct because on the second admission due to left breast cellulitis, the patient was given treatment via vancomycin and cipro, and upon discharge was prescribed Ciprofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, and Ondansetron. Option A is incorrect because while the patient received vancomycin during her second admission for the cellulitis, Dilaudid IV/PCA was provided post-operatively during the earlier admission for the bilateral mastectomy. Options B, D, and E are all referring to treatments and medications from the first admission relating to the patient's breast cancer procedure and not the second admission for cellulitis, thus they are incorrect but still plausible because they are based on the patient's overall medical history."
132,2,10363313,What was the patient's diagnosis after her evaluation for potential Ischemic Colitis based on note charted on 2158-12-06?,The patient was diagnosed with Severe Liver Disease.,The patient was diagnosed with Total Heart Failure.,The patient was confirmed to have Ischemic Colitis.,The patient was not diagnosed with Ischemic Colitis.,The patient was diagnosed with Severe Kidney Disease.,D,"The note charted on 2158-12-06 indicates that after evaluation for potential Ischemic Colitis, it was concluded that the patient did not suffer from this condition. As such, option D is correct. Option E is incorrect because, while the patient did have End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or severe kidney disease, this was not the result of the evaluation for Ischemic Colitis. Option C is incorrect because Ischemic Colitis was not confirmed in the patient. Option B is also incorrect because, while the patient did have Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), this was not the diagnosis after the evaluation for Ischemic Colitis. Lastly, option A is not correct because there is no mention of a diagnosis of Severe Liver Disease in the summary."
133,2,15953096,"What is the rationale behind the persistent hypoxia of the patient noted on an arterial blood gas sample, despite not having any perfusion defects on the V/Q scan or a cardiac shunt on the transthoracic echo?","The patient had active symptoms of Behcet's Syndrome, leading to elevated leukocytes and ensuing systemic inflammation, which interfered with oxygen transportation.",The hypoxia was due to pulmonary vein stenosis resulting from a recurrent pulmonary vein thrombosis the patient had experienced.,"The patient's microcytic, iron-deficient anemia caused a decrease in hemoglobin and thus lower oxygen-carrying capacity.","The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can cause transient hypoxia post-arrhythmia.",The hypoxia was attributable to an untreated lung infection noted in his medical records.,B,"Based on the discharge summary, it is deduced that the patient's hypoxia is related to the pulmonary vein stenosis that the patient previously experienced. This stenosis could create a low-flow state and in turn lead to persistent hypoxia as a chronic state. The remaining options, despite being plausible distractors based on information found in the provided notes, do not sufficiently explain the patient's condition. Option A is incorrect because there was no active flare of Behcet's Syndrome. While Option C pertains to the patient's anemia, it was deemed less likely to be causing rest hypoxia and wouldn't explain why hypoxia was found only in the arterial blood gas sample and not throughout the oxygen saturation. Option D is incorrect as the patient was in sinus rhythm during his stay. Finally, option E is incorrect because the patient was treated for a lung infection, making it an obsolete cause of the current hypoxia."
134,2,19612309,What was the key surgical procedure the patient underwent during the first provided admission and how did the patient respond to it?,The patient went through a laparoscopic liver biopsy and recovered instantly.,"The patient was subjected to a thoracotomy with intrathoracic anastomosis, reinforced with intercostal muscle without any residual complications.",The patient's key procedure was an umbilical hernia repair and he managed to heal promptly.,The patient experienced an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and was discharged promptly with no complaints.,The patient underwent laparoscopic jejunostomy feeding tube procedure and handled the surgery well.,B,"The primary surgical procedure performed on the patient during the first admission was a thoracotomy with intrathoracic anastomosis, which is bolstered with intercostal muscle. This procedure was the most significant due to the patient's condition (Esophageal cancer). The patient managed the surgery well, improved over time, and was discharged in a coherent mental state and ambulatory condition necessitating support, reflecting a positive response. The other choices, while they are procedures identified from the same note, were not the core procedures performed on this patient during the first admission, and are thus incorrect."
135,2,18122852,What are the findings and impressions from the MRI spine and EMG tests done for this patient to explain his bilateral proximal leg weakness?,The patient has exhibited signs of metastasis or cord compression as shown in the MRI scan.,The tests indicate the patient's weak leg strength is due to his lung cancer.,The MRI indicated that there were neurophysiological signs of a mild or early motor neuropathy and neurophysiological evidence of a proximal myopathy.,The tests reveal the patient is suffering from paraneoplastic syndromes including Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and polymyositis.,The MRI and EMG tests findings suggest that the patient has developed a mild ulnar neuropathy.,C,"The correct answer is C, as according to Note 2, MRI of the spine showed no evidence of metastasis or cord compression, and the EMG test was indicative of proximal myopathy and distal neuropathy. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect: A and D are false as no evidence of metastasis, cord compression, or paraneoplastic syndromes was found; B is not directly supported by the tests; E includes the presence of a mild ulnar neuropathy found in the EMG results, although it was likely an incidental finding and would not explain bilateral proximal leg weakness."
136,2,18665332,What was the suspected cause behind the patient's fall that led to her left femur fracture as noted in the first discharge summary on 2144-10-23?,The patient's fall was due to a minor head trauma she sustained after getting out of bed.,The patient fell due to her left-sided weakness from her previous stroke episode.,The patient had a fever and chills which caused her to lose balance and fall.,"The patient experienced dizziness due to orthostatic hypotension when she stood up, leading to her fall.","The fall was a result of the patient's rheumatoid arthritis, causing joint instability.",D,"The discharge summary indicated that upon standing, the patient experienced dizziness, a common symptom of orthostatic hypotension, which caused her to fall and fracture her left femur (choice D). Choice A is incorrect because although the patient mentioned a bump on her head, she did not remember any trauma to the head that caused her fall. Choice B is not accurate since the patient's past stroke left her with mild left-side weakness, but there were no indications that this caused her fall. Choice C is incorrect as the patient denied experiencing fever or chills, and choice E is also incorrect as her rheumatoid arthritis was not identified as a direct cause of her fall."
137,2,12124979,"What were the treatments the patient received during their first recorded admission (chart date: 2170-01-05) concerning the right breast cancer diagnosis, and what was the history of present illness described during the second admission (chart date: 2172-04-14)?","During their first admission, the patient received treatments of right mastectomy and insertion of tissue expander and was described as having stomach and back pain because of a sinus infection in the second admission.","In their first recorded admission, the patient was given treatment for hypertension and sinusitis, and during the second admission, breast cancer symptoms were recorded.","Treatments of right mastectomy and insertion of tissue expander were administered during the first admission, and in the second admission, the patient has a breast cancer diagnosis of stage IIA (T2, N0, Mx), and a series of symptoms including feeling lightheaded, nausea, vomiting, and lower quadrant tenderness were reported.","During the first reported visit, the patient had a sinus surgery and C- section as treatment procedures, with symptoms of recurrent episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody bowel movements in the second admission.",The patient received an uncomplicated previous pregnancies treatment during their first stay and presented with symptoms of a sinus infection during their second admission.,C,"According to note 1, the treatments administered to the patient were the right mastectomy and the insertion of a tissue expander for the right breast cancer. In note 2, the recorded symptoms upon the second admission were succinctly described as feeling a little bit lightheaded, feeling like passing out, losing consciousness, vomiting, and having lower quadrant tenderness. Choices A, B, D, and E are incorrect as the mentioned treatments or symptoms did not align with the patient's medical history included in the two notes."
138,2,12438257,What surgery did the patient undergo during her second admission to the hospital as documented on 2125-01-16?,The patient underwent an OR debridement of L axilla cellulitis with wound vac.,The patient had medical management for her right shoulder dislocation.,The patient underwent a reverse right total shoulder arthroplasty.,The patient underwent a surgery for her Systemic lupus erythematosus.,The patient had surgical management for an infection of skin and soft tissue underneath her left armpit and breast.,C,"During the patient's second admission to the hospital, as documented in note 2 on 2125-01-16, the patient underwent a 'Reverse right total shoulder arthroplasty'.  This surgical procedure was performed because of a chronic right shoulder dislocation. The other choices are incorrect but are good distractors because:  A: The patient indeed had 'OR debridement of L axilla cellulitis (wound vac)' but this was done during her first hospital visit as documented on 2124-06-05 in note 1.  B: While it is true that the patient had medical management for a right shoulder dislocation, she never underwent surgery for this condition during her first admission. D: No surgery was performed for the patient's Systemic lupus erythematosus. E: During her first admission, the patient had a procedure on her skin and soft tissue under her left armpit and breast. This was not a surgery but an invasive procedure, and it was not done on her second admission."
139,2,14113477,What was the reason for discontinuation of the patient's antihypertensive medication (Atenolol) at the end of his second admission?,The Atenolol was causing adverse side effects.,The patient had an allergic reaction to Atenolol.,The medication was not effective in controlling the patient's blood pressure.,The patient's blood pressure readings were consistently lower than usual.,The Atenolol was interfering with the treatment of the patient's ulcerative colitis.,D,"The passage from note 2 states, ""his blood pressures were lower than usual while you were in the hospital. We therefore recommend that you stop taking you blood pressure medication (atenolol) for a few days"". This implies option D is true. A, B, C, and E are incorrect but plausible distractors. The patient's allergy to NSAIDs (from note 1) could potentially be misinterpreted as Atenolol. Quetiapine, a psychoactive drug can occasionally raise blood pressure, but there was no direct indication from the passage that this was the reason for discontinuation of Atenolol (option C). Option E was invented but sounds plausible, given the several mentions of ulcerative colitis and his medication regimen for it."
140,2,15046746,What was the medical intervention made to treat the patient's adnexal mass issue on her first visit?,A laparoscopic tubal ligation was done.,"The patient was put on a regimen of Nabumetone, Fluoxetine, Clonazepam, Trazodone, and Baclofen.",A partial thyroidectomy was performed.,She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.,The patient was given discharge medications like Trazodone and Clonazepam.,D,"The correct answer is D because it mentions that the patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to tackle her adnexal mass issue. Although all of the choices are incidents or treatments mentioned in the discharge summary, answer choices A, B, C, and E are incorrect as they are non-related to the adnexal issue or are measures taken for other pre-existing conditions of the patient. A laparoscopic tubal ligation (Choice A) and partial thyroidectomy (Choice C) were executed in the past but are not related to the adnexal mass. The medicines (Choice B & E) given to the patient were for relieving symptoms related to other medical conditions like anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and not for the treatment of the adnexal mass."
141,2,11166200,What was the presumed diagnosis for the patient's multiple pulmonary nodules?,Nasal polyps,Chronic sinusitis,Ovarian cyst,Sarcoidosis,Pneumonia,D,"The patient's multiple pulmonary nodules were suspected to be a result of sarcoidosis as mentioned in note 2. Sarcoidosis is a condition characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) in different parts of the body. Nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis, and ovarian cyst are parts of the patient's past medical history and not the presumed diagnosis for the nodules. The pneumonia was treated as an immediate condition and not the cause of the pulmonary nodules."
142,2,18924984,What was the final diagnosis and recommended follow-up procedure for the cardiac condition observed during the patient's first hospital admission?,The final diagnosis was One vessel coronary artery disease and the recommended follow-up procedure was repeat CT in 3 months.,The patient was diagnosed with stable angina and was prescribed an aspirin regimen.,"The patient was found to have Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction, and the suggested follow-up procedure was cardiac stress test.",The final diagnosis was Gastroesophageal reflux disease and the recommended follow-up procedure was to start on Prilosec PRN.,"The patient was diagnosed with a benign pulmonary nodule, and the suggested follow-up procedure was to have it followed by a primary care doctor in 3 months.",A,"The discharge summary [note 1 end] mentions that the patient was diagnosed with 'One vessel coronary artery disease' and underwent 'Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal right coronary artery'. The patient was also found to have a lung nodule and was recommended a repeat CT scan in a few months' time for follow-up. Although option E is about a follow-up procedure, this is not related to the patient's cardiac condition. Options B, C, and D are incorrect as they refer to conditions and treatments not mentioned with respect to the cardiac condition observed during the patient's first hospital admission."
143,2,18753609,"What were the therapeutic interventions applied for the patient's left lower extremity pain, numbness and difficulty with ambulation during his admissions outlined in the discharge summaries?",The patient was given atorvastatin and gabapentin.,The patient was put on an insulin sliding scale and erythromycin eye drops.,"Underwent L5 partial laminectomy and L4 laminotomy, and received physical therapy.",Microwaved ablation of liver masses was performed.,Applied topical erythromycin ointment and artificial tears.,C,"The patient's left lower extremity pain, numbness, and difficulty with ambulation were managed during his first admission with an L5 partial laminectomy and L4 laminotomy, both surgical procedures carried out to relieve pressure on the spinal nerves. Physical therapy was also provided to aid rehabilitation (choice C). Choices A and B are wrong because, although the patient was given these medications, these were primarily to manage his diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and eye symptoms, not his leg symptoms. Choice D is related to a different admission where his liver masses were being treated, and not related to his leg symptoms. Choice E is wrong as the ointment and tears were for his eye symptoms not his leg symptoms."
144,2,13359350,What were the two significant operative findings during the patient's laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure performed on his second admission as per the discharge summary charted on 2132-07-04?,Diagnosed with HIV and diverticulitis several years ago.,Normal vital signs throughout the admission.,Acute cholecystitis identified as the reason for hospital admission.,Substantial inflammation of the gallbladder and a tear in the infundibulum leading to dropped stones.,He had a history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain for six days.,D,"The correct answer was chosen from the operative notes of the second hospital admission, which charted the patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure. This procedure revealed two significant findings: substantial inflammation of the gallbladder and a tear in the infundibulum leading to dropped stones.  Option A is incorrect as these are details from the patient's past medical history, not findings from the cholecystectomy.  Option B is incorrect as it references the patient's stable vital signs and does not bear relevance to the operation's findings.  Option C is incorrect because it refers to the diagnosis that prompted the operation, not the findings during the operation. Option E is incorrect as it denotes the symptoms leading to hospital admission, not the findings from the operation."
145,2,14659442,What were the treatment recommendations provided to the patient for chronic venous stasis post the second hospitalization?,Use of IV Vancomycin and wound cultures,Staying admitted for cellulitis treatment,Applying a mild steroid for pruritus,"Ongoing usage of moisturizers, fluocinolone for pruritus, compression stockings, elevating legs and biannual PCP check ups",Completion of six-month interferon treatment course for chronic HCV,D,"The correct answer is D, as these recommendations appear in the discharge summary following the second hospitalization [note 2]. It's stated that the patient was recommended to continue moisturizing his legs, use fluocinolone for pruritus, wear compression stockings to prevent further ulcers, and elevate his legs. He was also advised to maintain regular check-ups with his primary care physician.  Option A: IV Vancomycin and wound cultures were used as part of the patient's treatment during their hospital stay, rather than a recommendation post discharge. Option B: The patient was admitted for cellulitis treatment, which is not an ongoing recommendation.  Option C: The use of a mild steroid was mentioned, but discontinued as it was thinning the patient's skin and making it more susceptible to infections. Option E: The patient was indeed recommended to finish a six-month course of interferon for his chronic HCV, but this is not related to his venous stasis treatment."
146,2,13405160,"What were the invasive procedures performed on the patient during the two hospital admissions, and what were the reasons for these procedures?",Thoracentesis and thoracoscopy with talc pleuradesis were performed due to gastroenteritis.,"The patient underwent endometrial biopsy, and robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy because of metastatic endometrial cancer.",A pleural biopsy was conducted due to a suspected skin infection.,The patient had a right thoracoscopy due to a knee injury.,Thoracentesis was conducted due to a chronic migraine condition.,B,"During the patient's first hospital admission, they underwent thoracentesis, thoracoscopy with talc pleuradesis, and endometrial biopsy due to dyspnea and suspicion of metastatic disease. Subsequently, the patient was admitted again and underwent a robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to metastatic leiomyosarcoma. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect as these procedures weren't carried out, nor were the reasons mentioned in the discharge summaries."
147,2,13421014,"Given the patient's history with High-grade Dysplasia, did he experience any complications post his laparoscopic right colectomy?",The patient suffered from severe abdominal pain post-operation.,The patient experienced extreme lightheadedness and dizziness after the surgery.,The patient had no complications following the laparoscopic right colectomy.,The patient showed symptoms of an infection after the procedure.,The patient faced mental instability after the procedure.,C,"The correct answer is option C. This is confirmed by the note stating ""He tolerated the procedure well without complications."" The other options are incorrect. Option A is wrong as the patient did not suffer from severe abdominal pain post-surgery, as mentioned in this section ""abdomen: soft, slightly distended, appropriately tender."" Option B is incorrect because it mentions the patient experiencing lightheadedness and dizziness, but these symptoms are not linked to his surgical procedure. Option D mentions an infection, but the patient's notes do not indicate any signs of infection post-surgery. Finally, option E is incorrect as the patient did not face mental instability after the procedure, rather he was described as ""alert and oriented x 3"" in the discharge notes."
148,2,16278683,What medical intervention and diagnostic was done for the patient during the second admission to address the chief complaint?,The patient was given IV fluids and made nil per os.,The patient underwent sphincterotomy and multiple stones and sludge were removed from the CBD via balloon sweep.,The patient went through a rigorous health examination and consultation.,The patient had his liver labs checked regularly.,The patient was discharged to home on hospital day 9.,B,"The key words in the physician's question are ""medical intervention"" and ""diagnostic"". The medical intervention was a sphincterotomy and the removal of multiple stones and sludge from his common bile duct via balloon sweep, which was executed to address the patient's ""chief complaint"" of abdominal pain. Although all other options encapsulate activities undertaken during the patient's stay, including the initiation of IV fluids and making him NPO (option A), a rigorous health examination and consultations (option C), regular liver labs checking (option D), and discharge to home (option E), they are not specifically medical interventions to directly address the abdominal pain."
149,2,11166070,"What were the potential complications faced by the patient post surgical procedure as detailed in the second note, and how were they addressed?",The patient developed a severe leukocytosis and was transferred to the GYN service for care.,The patient experienced an outbreak of Keflex allergy noted on admission which required immediate attention.,"The patient experienced intense pain in the right lower quadrant due to a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, which was handled conservatively with medication.",The patient experienced difficulty urinating post surgery which was managed with a catheter.,The patient was diagnosed with a small hiatal hernia which was surgically rectified during the stay.,C,"The second note indicates that the patient developed right lower quadrant pain due to a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, a complication post-total abdominal hysterectomy which was managed successfully with medication. The pain evolved, thereby causing the patient to seek medical attention. The patient remained stable, with pain managed by medication and was tolerating oral intake. The choice C is correct because it is consistent with the information provided in the discharge summary.  Option A is incorrect as the patient was afebrile and had no leukocytosis. The allergy to Keflex was noted upon admission and not developed during her stay (option B). Choice D is invalid as the discharge notes inform that the patient had no difficulty in urinating. The patient was diagnosed with a small hiatal hernia (option E), but she was not admitted for this reason and there's no report of surgical treatment during her stay. The entire complexity of the discharge note was to determine the cause of the RLQ pain, which happens to be a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst."
150,2,15415344,"On which medication was the patient discharged, following his first and second admission?",The patient was discharged on Ativan treatment for base control of seizures.,The patient was discharged while on Zonisamide 400mg at bedtime.,The patient was discharged without any medication for the seizures.,The patient was discharged under Phenytoin Sodium treatment for control of seizures.,The patient was discharged having taken Zonegran medications.,D,"According to the first discharge summary, the patient was discharged on Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig and Zonisamide 100 mg Capsule Sig. However, the second discharge summary clarifies that the patient was discharged on Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig after Zonegran was discontinued due to side effects observed during the hospital stay. This justifies Choice D being the correct answer. The other choices are incorrect but serve as good distractors since they are all part of the medication history in the reports. But the question asks for the medication used at the time of discharge, which only Phenytoin Sodium applies to."
