Index,Num_Notes,Patient_ID,Question,Choice_A,Choice_B,Choice_C,Choice_D,Choice_E,Answer,Reason
1,3,13931284,What was the major surgical procedure performed on the patient during the third hospital stay?,The patient underwent intravenous antibiotic treatment.,The patient received Unasyn for his infection.,The patient received a split-thickness skin graft from the right side of his right lower leg.,The patient was treated with hydralazine.,The patient was professionally fitted with wraps or stockings up to 30 mm of mercury.,C,"In the discharge summary from the third note it's clear that the major surgical procedure performed was a split-thickness skin graft from the right side of his right lower leg. Option A, B, and D are incorrect because although they were treatments provided, they were not surgical procedures. Option E was suggested as a future treatment but wasn't performed during the third hospital stay. However, these options are included as distractors since they all pertain to treatments or procedures that could be performed within a medical setting."
2,3,13719908,What was the allergic reaction of the patient to Ativan and what was the level of certainty about Ativan as the cause for this reaction?,The patient had increased rectal pressure due to Ativan with a certainty level of 'Unknown',"The patient had no acute distress, alertness, and was oriented due to Ativan with the certainty level unknown.","The patient experienced Anaphylaxis and Hives as a result of an allergic reaction to Ativan, with a very certain level of certainty.",The patient experienced nausea which resolved with antiemetic due to Ativan with a 'Very certain' level of certainty.,The patient had inadequate pain control on oral pain medication due to Ativan with a 'Very certain' level of certainty.,C,"The correct answer is C because in the note it is stated: ""Ativan Anaphylaxis; Hives Level of Certainty: Very Certain"". The other options are events or conditions noted in the patient's medical history or during their treatment, but they were not specified to be related to Ativan. Therefore, with this information, we could infer that these statements about the patient are correct, but they would be incorrect answers to the question about the allergic reaction to Ativan and the level of certainty about Ativan being the cause of the allergic reaction."
3,3,12820943,What was the result of the bile culture taken on the patient's second visit to the hospital and what was its implications on the patient's treatment?,"The bile culture developed three strains of pan-sensitive staphylococcus, affecting the antibiotic treatment plan.",The bile culture did not offer any growth; hence it didn't impact the treatment plan.,"The bile culture developed pan-sensitive E. Coli, necessitating antibiotic intervention.","The bile culture showed an increase in E.Coli bacteria, further complicating the overall health of the patient.",The bile culture grew three strains of pan-sensitive E. coli but was unaltering to the course of the patient's treatment.,C,"The correct answer is C because patient's second visit to the hospital resulted in the bile culture growing three strains of pan-sensitive E. coli which had implications on her treatment, specifically, the initiation of antibiotics (Answer choice C). Answer choice A is incorrect because the patient's culture grew E. coli, not staphylococcus. Answer choice B is also wrong because the bile culture did grow E. coli. Although D contains correct information that the culture grew E. coli, it is misleading because it did not worsen the patient's overall health. Lastly, answer choice E is incorrect because the growth of E. coli did not leave the patient's treatment unaltered but required antibiotics to be administered."
4,3,19982896,What was the final conclusion about the patient's biliary obstruction and how was it treated?,"The patient's biliary obstruction was a result of a gallstone in the cystic duct, it was treated with ERCP and sphincterotomy.",The patient had a normal bile duct and her abdominal pain was resolved with diet changes and PRN analgesics.,"The patient was found to have a remnant gallbladder containing a large stone, treated by a completion, robot-assisted minimally invasive cholecystectomy.",The patient's biliary obstruction was a result of elevated alk phos and was treated with antibiotics and pain medications.,The patient's biliary obstruction was not treated and the patient was referred for biliary tract surgery.,C,"The patient's final diagnosis was a 'remnant gallbladder containing a large stone' as mentioned in note 3. The treatment was 'completion, robot-assisted minimally invasive cholecystectomy'. Although ERCP and sphincterotomy were performed [option A], they were not the final treatment; similarly, diet changes and PRN analgesics were given [option B], but they were not the treatment for biliary obstruction. Option D mentions that the biliary obstruction was a result of elevated alk phos, but this was not the final conclusion; antibiotics and pain medications formed a part of the treatment, but the main treatment was surgery. Option E is incorrect as the patient did undergo a treatment, which was a robot-assisted minimally invasive cholecystectomy."
5,3,11634796,"What is the progression of the patient's lumbar treatment and its results, as seen through the three discharge summaries?",The patient's primary complaint of back and leg pain was managed with medication only.,"The patient was initially admitted for surgery, then continued to recover at home, and attended physical therapy sessions routinely.","At the first admission, lumbar decompression L4-5 with discectomy was done, then the pain exacerbated, leading to the second admission where lumbar fusion with instrumentation L4-5 was performed.","The patient underwent a single procedure of lumbar decompression during the first admission, with no subsequent procedures.","The patient's symptoms of back and leg pain were managed through physical therapy sessions only, without invasive procedures.",C,"In the first discharge summary, the patient underwent a surgical procedure involving Lumbar decompression L4-5 with discectomy due to cauda equina syndrome (back and leg pain). In the second summary, the patient was admitted for the exacerbation of back pain following the procedure but did not undergo any surgical procedure during this hospital stay. However, in the third summary, the patient underwent another surgical procedure, the anterior/posterior lumbar fusion with instrumentation L4-5, indicating that her spinal problems had been remedied through multiple surgeries. Option A, D, and E are incorrect because the patient indeed went through surgeries, not managed with only medication or physical therapy. Option B could be misleading as it doesn't specifically mention the procedures the patient went under."
6,3,13186371,What was the first surgical intervention performed on the patient related to the neuropathy of his median and ulnar nerves and how was the patient managed post operatively?,"The patient was taken to the Operating Room for exploration of his right forearm and neurolysis of median and ulnar nerves, followed by pain management and arm elevation during the recovery phase.","The patient underwent Alloderm implantation into his forearm, followed by pain control and recovery while maintaining a regular diet.","The patient was initially treated with an application of a short-arm splint, followed by a post-operative regimen of pain control and reintroduction of regular diet.","The patient first underwent a dressing change and debridement under anesthesia in his right forearm, followed by pain control and resumption of home meds.","The patient was first subjected to right open carpal tunnel release, and his post-operative management involved regaining pain control and resumption of home medications, while eating a regular diet and keeping hydrated.",E,"The first surgical intervention observed from the discharge summary in [note 1] related to the patient's neuropathy of median and ulnar nerves involved the right open carpal tunnel release. Afterward, post-operative management consisted of stabilizing the patient, controlling pain, resuming all home medications, maintaining a regular diet, and checking for evidence of any ongoing bleeding. Choices A, B, C, and D refer to other procedures in the treatment timeline or elements of post-operative care that transpired, but they do not accurately answer the question regarding the first surgical intervention and the respective follow-up care."
7,3,15541725,What was the patient's chronological treatment plan and the complications as per the three discharge summaries?,"The patient was initially identified with abdominal abscess due to ulcerative colitis and was treated with prednisone and eventual abscess drainage. Further complications arose in the form of small bowel obstruction and a bleeding colocutaneous fistula, addressed respectively with bowel rest, serial abdominal exams, and a surgical intervention to drain an intraabdominal abscess.","The patient was first diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and small bowel obstruction, followed by a symptom of bleeding from the wound. However, the medical interventions only included prednisone administration and routine abdominal exams, nothing was performed to directly address the small bowel obstruction.","The primary concerns were ulcerative colitis and small bowel obstruction, which were resolved with bowel rest and administration of prednisone. The later complaint of bleeding from the wound didn't involve any surgical interventions or advanced treatment practices.","The patient was treated for ulcerative colitis first with an invasive surgery to drain an abscess, which later led to the complication of colorectal cancer. Therapy was conservative with bowel rest and antibiotics administration.","The main complications that arose were symptoms of abdomen pain and the small bowel obstruction. Despite the severity of the situation, the treatment practices involved only routine checks, administration of antibiotics and advice to steep away from operating heavy machinery.",A,"Response A comprehensively defines the patient’s disease progression and treatments as seen in the discharge summaries.  B, C, and D are incorrect as they don't mention or inaccurately describe the colocutaneous fistula bleeding and the resulting intervention. Similarly, E is incorrect because it omits vital aspects of the patient's treatment progression, including the initial abscess drainage and the later intra-abdominal abscess drainage. It also incorrectly states the patient was advised to avoid operating heavy machinery, which was only a precaution for some medications, not a part of the treatment plan."
8,3,13733607,What was the rationale behind the decision to change the patient's medication regimen after the brain biopsy in her second visit?,The patient experienced wound dehiscence.,The patient suffered from severe headaches.,The patient was diagnosed with a right frontal brain lesion.,The patient had an allergic reaction with azithromycin and lactose.,The post-operative changes required a different medication regimen.,E,"After undergoing a brain biopsy in her second visit, it was necessary to modify the patient's medication regimen to address everything from potential pain to preventing seizures due to the operation (as indicated by the prescription of Acetaminophen and Levetiracetam). The other options, while based on the information from the discharge notes, are incorrect. The medication changes were not due to a wound dehiscence (A), which happened in her third visit and resulted in the prescription of Cephalexin as a response. Severe headaches (B) were not mentioned as a symptom post-biopsy that justified the change, and the diagnosis of the right frontal brain lesion (C) was the reason for the brain biopsy, not the result of it or the reason for the medication change. The patient's allergies to azithromycin and lactose (D) were consistent across all hospital visits and weren't specifically the reason for the medication change post-biopsy."
9,3,18749643,What were the symptoms or issues that led to the patient's operation for right inguinal hernia repair as per the discharge summary charted on 2129-08-28?,Constant inability to urinate,Bilateral large inguinal hernias,Adenocarcinoma of colon,Metastatic colon cancer,Recurrent IVC thrombus,B,"As per 'note 3', it's clear that the patient had a long history of inguinal hernias and was experiencing discomfort and difficulty reducing the hernia on the right side. This led to the decision to fix the symptomatic right hernia causing the discomfort which led to the operation. The other options, while they did occur in the patient's history, were not direct reasons for the inguinal hernia operation. Adenocarcinoma of colon (C) and Metastatic colon cancer (D) were unrelated to his inguinal hernia. His inability to urinate (A) was a postoperative issue, not a reason for the operation. The IVC thrombus (E) is from note 2 and unrelated to the inguinal hernia operation."
10,3,13888167,"Did the patient have any significant changes in mental status between his hospital stays, and if so, when was this noted?","The patient's mental status worsened significantly, going from being able to perform his daily activities without assistance to always being confused.","There were no significant changes in the patient's mental status during his hospital stays, and he always maintained his previous capacities.",The patient experienced a significant improvement in mental status and gained new abilities during his second hospital stay.,"The patient's mental status fluctuated significantly between states, sometimes appearing normal and sometimes demonstrating severe confusion or agitation.","The patient's mental status improved during his successive hospital stays, and he regained the ability to perform some daily activities.",A,"The correct answer is A because the discharge diagnosis in the first note states that the mental status of the patient was ""Confused - always,"" while in the second note, the mental status is ""Confused - sometimes (his baseline)."" This can be interpreted to mean that there was a significant change in the patient's mental status between his stays, and it worsened. The other options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because they all either deny or contradict this conclusion. The information provided in the discharge summaries does not support options B, C, D, or E."
11,3,15630292,"What was the final definitive treatment the patient decided for her severe abnormal uterine bleeding/menorrhagia, and what was the immediate outcome?",The patient underwent a blood transfusion.,The patient underwent dilation and curretage.,The patient took medications like iron and Provera.,The patient decided on a total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy.,An endoscopic treatment was decided for the patient.,D,"According to the last note, the patient chose a total laparoscopic hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingectomy after considering other treatments with less effective results for her severe abnormal uterine bleeding or menorrhagia, such as blood transfusion (Answer A), dilation and curettage (Answer B), and medication (Answer C). In the immediate aftermath, the patient recovered well with controlled pain, tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, and ambulating independently (all part of Answer D). Answer E is incorrect as there is no mention of any endoscopic treatment. Options A, B, C and E are incorrect but are reasonable distractors as they are part of the patient’s medical history and treatments."
12,3,13032648,What were the causes of the patient's persistent right lower extremity pain and what surgical procedure was undertaken to address this?,The patient's pain was due to a back muscle strain and she was treated with pain medications.,The pain was caused by an abnormal hip and treated through Physiotherapy.,"The weakness in the patient's right leg was a symptom of Diabetes, she was treated with regular insulin injections.","The patient had a recurrent disc herniation at disk L5-S1, congenital spinal stenosis, and radiculopathy in the right lower extremity. She underwent revision R L5-S1 microdisc and L5-S1 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion procedures.","Chronic pain in the right leg was attributed to a knee injury, the patient was treated with pain medications and recommended physiotherapy.",D,"The discharge summary states that the patient had been suffering from a recurrent disc herniation at L5-S1, severe spinal stenosis and radiculopathy causing the pain in her right lower extremity. Various records document two procedures undertaken to address the issue: A revision R L5-S1 microdisc and an L5-S1 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion surgery.  Option A-E are incorrect because they are either inconsistent from the information or irrelevant.  Although muscular strains and issues with the hip were investigated, these were not the cause of the patient's pain (Options A and B). Diabetes was mentioned in the family history, but it was not directly related to her condition (Option C). Lastly, there is no evidence of a knee injury being the source of the patient's pain (Option E)."
13,3,10935535,What steps were taken in the treatment of the patient's right ICA aneurysm and what was the patient's condition during discharge after the last procedure?,"The patient underwent a left craniotomy and clipping of MCA aneurysm, and was coherent, alert and independent during discharge.","The patient was given medications including aspirin and plavix daily to treat the right ICA aneurysm, and was clear and coherent, alert and moving independently during discharge.","The patient underwent elective craniotomy and clipping of right ICA aneurysm, and was clear and coherent, alert and self-sufficient during discharge.","The patient underwent placement of a third flow diverter for the right ICA aneurysm, and was cognitively clear, alert, and capable of independent mobility during discharge.","The patient underwent a right ICA aneurysm pipeline stent, and was clear and coherent, alert and independent during discharge.",D,"According to the notes, the patient underwent placement of a third flow diverter for the right Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) aneurysm, which aligns with choice D. While other treatments like a left craniotomy and clipping of MCA Aneurysm, or a right ICA aneurysm pipeline stent (choices A, C, E) were given, these did not treat the right ICA aneurysm specifically. Even though the patient was put on medications like aspirin and plavix daily (choice B), this was not the primary treatment for the right ICA aneurysm. The wording describing the patient's condition during discharge also varied slightly in each choice but, according to the notes, the patient was ""clear and coherent"", ""alert"", and ""independent"", matching the descriptions in choice D."
14,3,10985750,"What is the consistent cause of the patient's repeated hospitalization, and what major medication changes have been made to better manage this condition?","The patient is repeatedly hospitalized due to severe abdominal pain, and the medication Felodipine was introduced to manage her condition.","The consistent cause of the patient's repeated hospitalizations is hyperemesis, and significant changes in her medication regimen including the introduction of PredniSONE, Sertraline, and Pyridoxine have been executed to manage this.","The patient has been repeatedly hospitalized for anemia, and has been prescribed iron supplements to manage her condition.","The patient's repeated hospitalizations are due to high blood pressure, and she has been administered Lisinopril to better control her condition.","The patient frequently goes to the hospital due to diabetes, and has been put on a new insulin regimen to manage her condition.",B,"Throughout the provided notes, it is clear that the pivotal cause behind the patient's repeated hospitalizations is an ailment known as hyperemesis, which is characterized by severe and persistent nausea and vomiting. In order to manage this condition, key changes have been made to her medication regimen. The amendments include Pantoprazole, Prednisone, Sucralfate, Metoclopramide, Pyridoxine, Ondansetron, and Sertraline, which are meant to treat her symptoms associated with hyperemesis, hence B remains the correct option. The alternatives A, C, D, and E, while containing information from the discharge summary, do not correctly answer the question because these conditions and treatments have not been consistently presented in the patient's history."
15,3,10494486,What was the cause of the patient's death post liver transplant operation?,Patient died due to a severe allergic reaction.,Patient died due to severe nausea and vomiting.,Patient died due to uncontrollable bleeding during the operation.,Patient died due to a severe infection post operation.,Patient died due to severe liver failure post operation.,C,"According to the data from note 3, following the liver transplant operation, the patient couldn't be stabilized due to uncontrollable bleeding. The patient was brought to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) on multiple high dose IV medications for maintaining blood pressure, but he didn't survive. The patient had Hepatitis C, complications from cirrhosis, and Hepatocellular carcinoma, but none of these were immediate causes of death post operation. The other options are not correct as they are not mentioned in the context of the patient’s death in the notes."
16,3,12119674,What procedures were done to the patient in her subsequent visits after the first admission and why?,The patient underwent a left UPJ obstruction and pyeloplasty in the second visit because of persistent bilateral flank pain.,A right endopyelotomy was performed during the patient's second visit due to worsening flank pain.,"In the second visit, an MRI/MRA was obtained after removing a genital ring because of a chronic pain complaint, and in the third visit, a Lap pyloplasty was performed due to R UPJO.","During each subsequent visit, the patient was given a series of diagnostic tests because of unexplained symptoms.",The patient received chronic pain medication management during both subsequent visits to manage worsening pain.,C,"The notes show that after the first admission, the patient had a second visit where an MRI/MRA was obtained once the patient's genital ring had been removed, the motivation was chronic pain control. In the third visit, she underwent a R Lap pyloplasty procedure because she had a painful R UPJO. While choices A, B, D, and E all discuss aspects of the patient's treatment and care they are either incorrect or incomplete answers for the given question."
17,3,14483101,What was the main reason for the patient's admission on the date 2131-02-13?,The patient was admitted due to postpartum fever and possible endometritis.,"The patient was admitted for treatment of abdominal pain radiating towards the back, confirmed to be due to gallstones, and underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",The patient was readmitted due to a return of fever and abdominal pain after a surgical abortion.,The patient was admitted due to several episodes of nausea related to gallstones.,The patient was admitted for presumed endometritis and underwent IV antibiotic treatment.,B,"In the note dated 2131-02-13, it is indicated that the patient was admitted due to severe abdominal pain radiating toward the back, which was linked to gallstones. The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Other choices are incorrect as they relate to different admissions or include incorrect diagnoses or procedures. Option A refers to a previous admission where the patient had a postpartum fever. Option C pertains to a later admission, and options D and E are incorrect interpretations of the patient's symptoms and treatment on the date in question."
18,3,19516074,What chronic condition does the patient have which may complicate her medical recovery and pain management?,She has a history of porcelain gallbladder,She is suffering from diabetes mellitus,She has been diagnosed with hyperalgesia,She has a history of monoclonal gammopathy,She has a history of substance abuse,C,"The correct answer is that the patient has been diagnosed with hyperalgesia, a condition that can complicate pain management due to increased sensitivity to pain. This condition does not directly interfere with medical recovery but can make pain management difficult, which indirectly impacts recovery. The four distractors are also chronic conditions that were listed in the patient's medical history but have not been explicitly linked to potential complications in recovery or pain management in this particular patient. For instance, she does have a history of porcelain gallbladder (A), diabetes mellitus (B), monoclonal gammopathy (D), and substance abuse (E), but the notes do not indicate that these conditions are currently complicating her medical recovery or pain management."
19,3,13156250,What were the therapeutic interventions employed for the patient's breast metastases to axillary lymph nodes?,The patient was administered anticancer drugs for the treatment of axillary lymph node metastases.,The patient underwent radiation therapy to treat her breast cancer metastases to the axillary lymph nodes.,The patient had undergone surgical removal of abnormally palpable nodes in the axilla at two different times.,The patient was treated with hormone therapy for her breast cancer metastasis to the axillary lymph nodes.,The patient had immunotherapy for the metastases to her axillary lymph nodes.,C,"According to the notes, the patient underwent several surgical procedures to address her breast cancer metastasis to axillary lymph nodes. The procedures primarily involved axillary lymph node excision and axillary nodal dissection. These procedures were performed as part of the individualized therapeutic intervention to manage her condition. Choices A, B, D, and E are not supported by the medical notes. While they may be generally reasonable approaches for managing cancer metastases, they were not employed in this patient's case, making them incorrect in this context."
20,3,14880051,What was the patient's condition during her first two admissions related to vaginal bleeding and does this correlate with her medical history?,The patient had two incidences of vaginal bleeding due to a ruptured ovarian cyst and this is consistent with her history of ovarian cysts.,The patient experienced two episodes of vaginal bleeding due to endometriosis and this aligns with her history of endometriosis.,"The patient experienced bleeding caused by an abruption and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), which aligns with her having previous similar issue with an urgent C-section at 33 weeks due to PPROM.",The patient was dealing with two instances of vaginal bleeding due to normal pregnancy issues and this does not correlate with her past medical history.,"The patient had vaginal bleeding due to an abnormally functioning IUD, which doesn't correlate with her medical history.",C,"The particulars in the notes distinctly indicate that the patient experienced vaginal bleeding amid her first two admissions due to an abruption and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). This somewhat correlates with her past pregnancy complications, particularly when she required an urgent C-section at 33 weeks due to PPROM. The distractors include information that seems plausible but does not accurately fit with the details from the patient’s medical history. For instance, options A, B, and E are wrong as the patient denied having ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and there is no mention of an IUD causing the bleeding. Option D is incorrect as it downplay the patient's problems, while the notes suggest it was a serious issue and her condition relatively aligns with her past medical history."
21,3,14792599,"What was the patient's initial reaction to Remicade, and what was the subsequent decision in his management?","The patient immediately developed hives and was given an epipen, then switched to Humira for future treatment.","The patient reported cramping abdominal pain following the infusion of Remicade, as a subsequent measure he was given a different medication.","The patient showed symptoms of an allergic reaction after the administration of Remicade, including whole body hives, wheezing, and rigors. Then, the patient was taken off Remicade and eventually stopped taking Humira as well.","After Remicade administration, the patient developed an itching sensation all over his body. He was subsequently prescribed a change in his diet.",The patient experienced shortness of breath after receiving Remicade and was given an inhaler by the medical team for his daily use.,C,"According to the provided discharge summaries, the patient had an anaphylactic reaction to Remicade, after which he was taught how and when to use an epi pen and discharged on prednisone, fexofenadine, and ranitidine. The summaries also note that the patient took himself off Humira a year after the incident. The other answer choices either inaccurately describe the patient's reaction to Remicade (B, D, E), the subsequent intervention (A), or both (A, D)."
22,3,13484453,What were the circumstances and treatments related to the patient's prior admissions due to cardiac and gallbladder issues?,The patient had multiple prior surgeries for spinal stenosis and later developed heart complications which successfully resolved after cardiac catheterization and right femoral line procedure.,The patient had multiple prior admissions for spinal stenosis and was treated with gabapentin daily which was not successful.,"The patient had prior admissions due to heart issues such as chest pain/discomfort and difficulty breathing, and treatments included cardiac catheterization and a right femoral line procedure. The patient was also admitted for abdominal/gallbladder issues and underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.","The patient had prior issues with spinal stenosis, successfully treated with surgical procedures, after which the patient developed chest pain and heart problems that were resolved with medications.",The patient had prior admissions for liver complications and was successfully treated with liver function tests and medications.,C,"The notes indicate that the patient was admitted for heart issues such as chest pain and difficulty breathing, and treatments included cardiac catheterization and right femoral line procedure ([note 1]). In another admission, the patient presented with gallbladder issues and the treatment was a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement ([note 2]). Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect but are good distractors. Option A is incorrect as it mentions multiple surgeries for spinal stenosis, which is not indicated in the notes. Option B is incorrect as the patient’s spinal stenosis treatment with gabapentin wasn't the reason for his admissions. Option D is incorrect as it suggests heart problems were resolved with medications, but the notes show surgeries were performed. Option E is incorrect as it mentions liver complications which are not indicated in the notes."
23,3,12962409,What was the previous surgery performed for the patient before his last admission and what was its outcome?,"Prostatectomy was performed for the patient's prostate cancer, which resulted in unremarkable improvement.",A surgery to mend a Left Femoral Neck Fracture (LNFx) was done and was successful.,The patient underwent an operation for Alzheimer's dementia leading to substantial mental ability restoration.,A heart surgery was executed addressing the patient's Left Bundle Branch Block causing tremendous enhancement in cardiac function.,The patient went through a thyroidectomy for his hypothyroidism leading to balanced thyroid levels.,B,"The notes clearly mention that the patient was previously operated for a left femoral neck fracture (L hemiarthroplasty), which he tolerated well. This can be deduced from mentions across all notes and specifically from the lines 'The patient was found to have a L femoral neck fx…' and ' was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service'. This rules out the other options which are either completely false or are conditions that the patient has but did not undergo surgery for, such as Alzheimer's dementia, left bundle branch block, and hypothyroidism. Prostate surgery was performed but it isn’t the latest surgery before his most recent admission."
24,3,19485613,What was the recommended course of action for the patient's history of pre-term birth and what was the actual course of action that was taken?,"The recommended course of action was to administer periodic doses of Magnesium sulfate and keep the patient in the antepartum floor, but the actual course of action involved starting 17-OHP and transferring her to the obstetrics clinic.","The recommended course of action involved receiving 17-OHP, and the actual course of action encompassed administering intramuscular Progesterone on a weekly basis.","The recommended course was to perform a cervical dilation screening and start Makena treatment, but the actual course of action was bed rest in the hospital.",The patient was recommended to intake 17-OHP and the actual course incorporated her being kept in hospital due to preterm labor.,"The patient was advised to go for cervical length screening and Makena address her preterm birth history, but she experienced preterm labor and advanced cervical dilation.",B,"The doctor's note [note 1 end] indicates that the recommended course of action was for the patient to receive 17-OHP due to her propensity for preterm labor. This was executed as planned, with the patient receiving intramuscular Progesterone on a weekly basis as indicated in 'Discharge Medications'.  Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect since they mention treatments and events (Magnesium sulfate, cervical dilation screening, Makena, advanced cervical dilation, hospitalization due to preterm labor) that are either incorrect as per the information given in the doctor's notes or are not reflected in the patient’s actual course of action."
25,3,12835453,What significant changes in the patient's medication regimen were made between the first and second hospital admissions?,The dosage of Aspirin was increased during the second admission.,The patient stopped taking Ibuprofen during the second admission.,The patient was started on Cyclobenzaprine during the second admission.,The patient was prescribed Ketoconazole during the second admission.,The patient was prescribed HYDROmorphone during the second admission.,A,"During the first admission, the patient was on Aspirin 325 mg PO BID, however, during the second admission, the patient was on Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY, indicating that the dosage of Aspirin was decreased. Option B is incorrect because Ibuprofen was not stopped during the second admission. Option D is incorrect because the patient was already on Ketoconazole during the first admission. Option E is incorrect because the patient was prescribed HYDROmorphone during the first admission. Option A is incorrect because the dosage of Aspirin was decreased, not increased during the second admission."
26,3,12492828,"What were the results, if any, of the patient's adrenal insufficiency and associated hyponatremia during her colonoscopy preparation in 2197, and have there been any instances of heightened symptoms since?",The colonoscopy preparation resulted in sepsis due to the patient's suppressed immune system linked to adrenal insufficiency.,The patient experienced severe hyponatremia and dehydration during colonoscopy preparation.,The patient's sodium levels were effectively managed and remained normal throughout the colonoscopy preparation and procedure.,The patient experienced severe dehydration during colonoscopy but managed to control her sodium levels.,"The colonoscopy preparation resulted in unstable cortisol levels, which worsened the patient's adrenal insufficiency.",C,"The discharge summary from 2197 (note 1) reveals that the patient's adrenal insufficiency and associated hyponatremia were carefully managed during her colonoscopy preparation. The patient's sodium levels remained normal throughout her stay and prior to discharge, which means the significant fluctuation typical in adrenal insufficiency and hyponatremia were avoided.  Option A is incorrect as there is no mention of the patient having sepsis due to a suppressed immune system. Option B is also incorrect because her sodium levels remained normal during her preparation and the procedure. Option D could be misleading as while the patient has a history of dehydration and hyponatremia, this was not an issue during the colonoscopy preparation. Option E is incorrect because there's no mention of fluctuating cortisol levels during the colonoscopy preparation."
27,3,19987983,"What treatment was provided to the patient during his second stay at the hospital due to abdominal pain, according to the note from the hospital visit charted on April 23, 2131?","The patient received medication for pain control, advanced diet progressively, and practiced respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry.","He was given amicar loading dose, pneumoboots and instructed to ambulate.",The patient was started on antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole).,The patient had a tonsil bleed that was treated using cauterization.,The patient was admitted for monitoring because of bleeding from tonsil.,A,"The doctor's question refers to the treatment provided during the patient's second stay at the hospital due to abdominal pain, as described in the note dated April 23, 2131 (note 2). Here, it states that post laparoscopic appendectomy, the patient had pain controlled with Tylenol and oxycodone, his diet was progressively advanced, and he practiced respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry. Therefore, answer A is correct. Answer B refers to a different treatment received by the patient during a different hospital stay referenced in note 1. Answer C pertains to the treatment received by the patient during the third hospitalization (note 3), which is not the one asked by the doctor. Answers D and E discuss treatments from note 1, which occurred during a different visit and for a different condition than what's being asked about."
28,3,19739175,What was the reason for the patient's second hospital visit and what was the surgical intervention performed during this admission?,The patient was admitted for a posterior wound infection and underwent surgical incision and drainage.,The patient was readmitted for management of hypoglycemic Motor Vehicle Crash (MVC) and underwent a motor function restoration procedure.,The patient was admitted for neck pain and underwent a C1-2 wiring with iliac crest bone graft procedure.,The patient was admitted for severe pain control and was treated with oxycodone 60mg for pain management.,The patient was admitted for issues related to his insulin pump basal rate and received adjustments to his dosage by endocrinology consultants.,C,"The second hospital visit of the patient was due to neck pain, caused by the unsuccessful healing of a C2 fracture that was treated earlier with a halo vest. During this visit, a C1-2 wiring with iliac crest bone graft was performed. The other options were all based on incidents or treatments during the patient's hospital visits, but they do not address the specific concern highlighted in the question- the reason for his second visit and the associated surgical intervention. Options A, D, and E relate to treatments received during other hospital visits while option B describes an event leading to the first admission (hypoglycaemic MVC) and does not involve an associated surgical procedure."
29,3,14816803,What was the preliminary diagnosis of the mass removed from the patient's right lung during his last admission?,The mass was diagnosed as an instance of recurrent herniation.,The mass was determined to be part of a recurrent incisional hernia.,The mass was identified primarily as a deep vein thrombosis initially.,The mass was preliminarily identified as a possible carcinoid tumor.,The mass was determined to be a symptom of the patient's hypertension.,D,"The correct answer is D, the mass removed from the patient's right lung was preliminarily identified as a possible carcinoid tumor as per note 3. A is incorrect as the mass wasn't diagnosed as recurrent herniation, it was located in the patient's lung, not in the area of previous herniation. B is incorrect as well, the mass was not associated with the recurrent incisional hernia. As in note 2, it has no relevance to the tumor in the lung. The same logic applies to answer C; the deep vein thrombosis is a misdirection, it didn't have any relevance to the mass in the lung. Answer E is incorrect because the mass was not a consequence of the patient's history of hypertension."
30,3,11795159,What was the primary surgical intervention conducted on the patient's third visit to the hospital and what was the reason for this procedure?,"The surgical procedure conducted was a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy due to an acute, uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis.",The intervention performed was an abdominal CT scan because of the abdominal pain the patient was experiencing.,There were no major surgical procedures known as the patient was treated with oral medication and vaginal suppositories.,A colonoscopy was conducted to examine the inflamed sigmoid colon.,Intervention included administration of IV fluids and antibiotics due to the patient's fever and nausea.,A,"Answer choice A is the correct answer as it states that the patient underwent a Laparoscopic Sigmoid Colectomy, as indicated in note 3, due to recurrent diverticulitis attacks. Answer choice B is incorrect because no CT scan is mentioned in note 3, where the third hospital visit is summarized, it just mentioned the patient's past. Answer choice C, D and E are incorrect as they don't mention a major surgical procedure conducted during the patient's third visit and diverticulitis is not treated with these methods."
31,3,11122203,What is the patient's history of perirectal abscess management and how many times has the abscess been drained?,"The patient has a history of simple perirectal abscesses, drained twice.","The patient has a history of complex perirectal abscesses, drained five times.","The patient has a history of simple perirectal abscesses, drained once.","The patient has a history of complex perirectal abscesses, drained three times.","The patient has a history of simple perirectal abscesses, drained six times.",B,"The correct answer, as revealed in the discharge summaries, is that the patient has a history of complex perirectal abscesses and has undergone abscess drainage five times. This is inaccurately reflected in all other options, which either misrepresent the number of times the abscess has been drained or the complexity of the abscess. Option A mentions only two drainages, option C mentions one drainage, option D mentions three drainages, and option E mentions six drainages, all of which do not align with the information from the notes. Moreover, option A, C and E describe the abscesses as simple whereas they are documented as complex. Therefore, options A, C, D and E are all incorrect but good distractors as they incorporate information from the discharge summary notes, even if inaccurately."
32,3,13606092,"What is the patient's course of treatment for each episode of diverticulitis, considering especially the medications and management approaches adopted in light of the patient's allergy to Ciprofloxacin?","In the first episode, the patient was managed with Amoxicillin and Flagyl and gradually transitioned to a regular low residue diet.","For the second diverticulitis attack, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl were used after an allergic reaction to Ciprofloxacin, combined with fluids, a low residue diet, and being made NPO.","The first episode was managed using Cipro and Flagyl and bowel rest, and then patient was shifted to a regular low residue diet.",The third episode was treated using Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl IV along with bowel rest and hydration.,"Upon the third recurrence, Medications on Admission like Crestor, Zyrtec, and Flonase were continued for the treatment.",B,"During the first occurrence of diverticulitis, the patient, based on the discharge summary note 1, was indeed managed using Cipro and Flagyl alongside bowel rest and was progressively shifted to a regular low residue diet. However, according to details from note 2, for the second episode, the patient developed an allergic response to Ciprofloxacin which resulted in a switch to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Regarding the other options, choice A is incorrect as Amoxicillin wasn't used for the initial case. Answer C is also wrong because Ciprofloxacin wasn't suitable during the second episode due to allergy. Even though the patient was initially started on Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl IV in the third incident, it is not the answer as the treatment was discontinued (option D). The medications listed under option E were not used specifically for diverticulitis management but were part of the patient's general medication regimen. Given these points, choice B gives the correct depiction of the management strategy, taking into account the Ciprofloxacin allergy."
33,3,13046975,What were the procedures performed on the patient over the course of his three admissions and their reasons?,The patient underwent two procedures for appendicitis and one for gastroenteritis.,The patient had two surgical attacks and one physical therapy session for severe pain.,"The patient was subjected to an ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement for abdominal pain, a cholecystectomy due to gallstone pancreatitis, and another ERCP for stent removal and stone extraction.",The patient suffered three heart attacks that were treated with stent placements.,The patient underwent three chemotherapy treatments due to a cancer diagnosis.,C,"The answer choice C is correct as it accurately mentions the three procedures that the patient went through: 1) ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement due to abdominal pain, which presumably was due to a stone (note 1), 2) laparoscopic cholecystectomy which had to be converted to open cholecystectomy due to extensive inflammation and adhesions (note 2), and 3) another ERCP for stent removal and stone extraction (note 3). Other choices incorrectly mention procedures and the reasoning behind them that are not mentioned in the provided notes."
34,3,11475310,What was the reason for the patient's readmission to the hospital on the date 2127-04-10?,The patient was re-admitted due to a bladder infection.,The patient was readmitted because of worsening back pain.,The patient was readmitted due to misplaced posterior thoracic instrumentation.,The patient readmitted because of a urinary tract infection.,The patient was readmitted due to issues related to diabetes and high blood pressure.,C,"The summary on the Chartdate: 2127-04-10 (Note 3) states that the patient required a ""revision and extension of her previous fusion"" because she ""has displaced her posterior thoracic instrumentation."" This is the reason for the patient's readmission on this date. Option B is incorrect as this was the reason for the patient's readmission on the previous visit. Options A, D, and E are invalid because there is no mention of these issues necessitating a readmission in the patient's notes."
35,3,10855973,"What surgical procedures has the patient undergone to address his neck pain, arm weakness, and cervical spine disease, and what was the patient's condition following each of these procedures?","The patient underwent cervical corpectomy at C6 with C5-7 fusion to address neck pain, arm weakness, and cervical spine disease. Following the surgery, he was pain-controlled and capable of voiding and ambulating autonomously prior to be discharged.","The patient underwent left retrograde pyelogram to address his neck pain, arm weakness, and cervical spine disease. After the procedure, his pain was well control with oral pain medications and he was able to eat, walk and urinate without difficulty.","The patient had a robot assist laparoscopic pyeloplasty to alleviate his symptoms of neck pain, arm weakness, and cervical spine disease. He was in stable condition following the procedure.","The patient was treated with a bilateral cervical discectomy at C4-5 C5-6 C6-7 to address his neck pain, arm weakness, and cervical spine disease. Following the surgery, the patient showed improvement.","The patient underwent cystoscopy to address neck pain, arm weakness, and cervical spine disease. After the procedure, his condition was stable.",A,"In the provided discharge summaries note 1, it is mentioned that the patient underwent cervical corpectomy at C6 with C5-7 fusion to address his condition. After the surgery, he woke up from anesthesia without difficulty, was pain-controlled, voiding, and ambulatory, hence the correct answer is A. Although the remaining potential answers B, C, D, and E found in the summaries, they relate to urological surgeries for other conditions and not to treat the patient's neck pain, arm weakness, and cervical spine disease, making them incorrect responses."
36,3,11523234,What was the patient's clinical course and management plan during her second admission following the total thyroidectomy and parathyroid procedures?,"The patient was readmitted due to high fever and neck pain, and was treated with oral Augmentin after the cultures showed MSSA. She was also found to have a DVT in her left internal jugular vein which was treated with a combination of Heparin and home Coumadin.","The patient was treated with antimicrobial therapy for HSV infection observed in blood cultures, and surgical drainage was applied for an infected seroma in the neck wound.",Another thyroid surgery was done during her second admission and was provided insulin for tending her newly diagnosed Diabetes.,The patient was hospitalized due to a pneumonia infection and was treated with a course of antibiotics.,The patient was readmitted for total knee replacement surgery and was provided physical therapy sessions for faster recovery.,A,"As per the second note, the patient was readmitted due to fever and neck pain. After examination, it was found out that the patient had MSSA (Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus) , thus, she was given oral Augmentin. The presence of a DVT in her left jugular vein was detected, therefore, the patient was started on a Heparin drip while continuing her home Coumadin. B is incorrect because she didn't have HSV infection and there was no mention of infected seroma but a fluid collection in the thyroid bed. In C, the patient didn't have another thyroid surgery nor was diagnosed with diabetes during the second admission. D is incorrect as the patient didn't suffer from pneumonia. E is incorrect as the patient didn't have a knee replacement surgery nor physical therapy sessions."
37,3,18944138,"Was the patient operated previously for her liver conditions, and if so, what operations were performed and what were the outcomes?","The patient was operated once for liver conditions in the form of a right portal vein embolization. However, no further operations were performed on her liver.",The patient underwent a total of three operations. These included two right portal vein embolizations and a right hepatic trisegmentectomy.,"The patient had three major surgical procedures for her liver conditions: a right portal vein embolization, an exploratory laparotomy with a wedge liver biopsy, and a right hepatic trisegmentectomy.","The patient underwent two distinct operations: an exploratory laparotomy with wedge liver biopsy, and a right hepatic trisegmentectomy. No other surgeries were performed.","The patient was operated twice for her liver conditions: once was a right hepatic trisegmentectomy, and the second operation details are missing.",C,"In Notes [1], [2] and [3] the mention of the three surgical procedures performed on the patient for her liver conditions are clearly stated. The right hepatic trisegmentectomy was performed in the third operation [note 3] which was successful. The incorrect options A, B, D and E, are either mentioned in the summary or represent possible confusions, such as missing information or incorrect operation count. However they do not accurately reflect the full sequence of operations performed on the patient as described in notes 1, 2, and 3."
38,3,12958983,What was the patient's clinical condition after the elective takedown and closure of his ileostomy?,The patient reported uncontrolled pain post-surgery.,The patient was vomiting and could not keep down fluids.,The patient experienced fevers and chills post-surgery.,"The patient was stable, tolerated a regular diet, was ambulating without difficulty, and had pain controlled on oral medications.",The patient's condition worsened and required readmission.,D,"Based on the information from discharge summary 3 [note 3 end], the patient was stable following the elective takedown and closure of his ileostomy. He tolerated a regular diet, was walking without trouble, and experienced sufficient pain relief from oral medications. Options A, B, and C, while mentioned in other parts of the patient's medical history, do not accurately reflect the patient's condition following this specific surgical procedure. Option E is incorrect as the notes do not mention a readmission due to a worsening condition."
39,3,15877599,What was the cause identified for the patient's acute kidney injury during his admission on 2119-01-15?,Presence of intrabdominal abscess,Advancing Diet,Increasing ostomy output due to gastroenteritis,High oxycodone intake,Complications from recent surgery,C,"From 'note 2', the patient's admission on 2119-01-15 was primarily for gastroenteritis, with severe dehydration and acute kidney injury.. The cause of the acute kidney injury was identified to be pre-renal in origin, a kind of kidney damage caused due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys. In other words, the kidney damage occurred due to dehydration induced by the patient's prevailing gastroenteritis, characterized by an increase in ostomy output. This is supported by the fact that his creatinine levels improved with IV hydration.   Options A and D are incorrect as no mention was made in the notes of an intrabdominal abscess or high oxycodone intake contributing to kidney injury at this time. Option B ""advancing diet"" is incorrect -- though diet was mentioned in the context of his recovery, it wasn't pointed out as a cause of the kidney injury. Option E ""Complications from recent surgery"" is incorrect as the recent surgery mentioned in the notes was an ileostomy takedown but not linked to the acute kidney injury."
40,3,12864168,What was the patient's weight at each of her hospital admissions and what might the changes indicate about her condition or treatment plan?,"The patient's weight went from 130 pounds to 108 pounds, which signifies the severity of her hyperemesis gravidarum condition.","The patient weighed 130 pounds at first, which rose to 140 pounds, indicating the progression of her pregnancy.","The patient's weight decreased to 113 pounds, indicating she was under-stressed.","The patient's weight was steady at 130 pounds throughout her visits, which suggests she may have been hydrated properly.","The weight of the patient went from 130 pounds to 113 pounds, signifying a possible heart condition.",A,"The hospital notes indicate that the patient's weight went from 130 pounds (pre-pregnancy) to 113 pounds (first hospital admission) and then to 108 pounds (second hospital admission). This is indicative of weight loss owing to her condition of hyperemesis gravidarum, which is severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, leading to dehydration and weight loss.  The other options are incorrect. Option B is incorrect as the text does not indicate any weight gain. Option C is incorrect as there's no indication of stress in the notes. Option D is incorrect as the patient's weight does decrease, and it's an inference that doesn't consider her condition of hyperemesis gravidarum. Lastly, Option E contains incorrect information and a heart condition isn't mentioned in the notes."
41,3,17601584,What is the primary diagnosis of the patient on their third visit and did the patient's medication regimen change in any way during their second hospital visit and the third visit?,The patient was diagnosed with Lumbar stenosis during the third visit and there was no change in medication between the second and third visits.,"The patient was diagnosed with back pain during the third visit and her medication was modified to include Enbrel SureClick, Diazepam, and HYDROmorphone between the second and third visits.",The patient was diagnosed with disc herniation during the third visit and there was no change in her medication regimen between the second and third visits.,The patient was diagnosed with back pain during the third visit and her medications remained same between the second and third visit.,The patient was diagnosed with Arthritis during the third visit and her medications remained the same between second and third visits.,B,"The discharge summary from the third visit tells us that the primary diagnosis of the patient was back pain. During the course of her second visit, patient was on dilaudid, methotrexate, mobic, enbril while during her third hospital stay, she was given Enbrel SureClick, meloxicam, HYDROmorphone, Senna, Docusate Sodium, and Diazepam for pain control, therefore her medication regimen clearly changed between the second and third hospital stays. The other options (A, C, D, E) contain incorrect diagnoses or incorrect information about her medication regimen - all of which are good distractors as they include information that was mentioned elsewhere in the documents."
42,3,10442812,Did the patient have any complications post her Total thyroidectomy surgery and how was her hydration managed given her state of diabetes insipidus?,The patient experienced severe complications after the surgery and required intensive care.,The patient's hydration was managed by increasing her sodium levels to prevent dehydration.,"The patient managed well post-surgery without complications, hydration was properly maintained with IV fluids where her fluid rate was adjusted to maintain sodium levels less than 145.","After the surgery, the patient developed wound infection and hematoma.",The patient's hydration was managed by withholding fluids to manage her diabetes insipidus.,C,"According to note 2, the patient managed well after the Total thyroidectomy surgery without complications, and her hydration was managed with IV fluids whereby adjustments were made to maintain sodium levels less than 145, to cater to her diabetes insipidus condition. Option A, D, and E are incorrect because they do not align with the details provided in the note- there were no severe complications, wound infection, hematoma, or withholding of fluids. Option B is incorrect as it inaccurately states that her sodium levels were increased to prevent dehydration, rather the fluid adjustments were made to keep her sodium levels in check."
43,3,10462407,What significant surgical procedures has the patient undertaken between the years 2143 to 2151 and for what diagnoses were they respectively performed?,The patient underwent a Total laparoscopic hysterectomy for a case of genetic predisposition to endometrial cancer in 2143 and a Laparoscopically-assisted low anterior resection for recto-sigmoid adenocarcinoma in 2149.,The patient underwent a Total knee arthroplasty for mild left knee pain in 2151 and a Total laparoscopic hysterectomy due to genetic predisposition to endometrial cancer in 2149.,"Laparoscopically-assisted low anterior resection was performed in 2143 due to rectal cancer diagnosis, followed by total laparoscopic hysterectomy for risk reduction in the setting of Lynch Syndrome in 2149 then a Total knee arthroplasty for severe Osteoarthritis, left knee in 2151.","The patient had surgery for rectal cancer in 2143. In 2149, a Total knee arthroplasty was performed due to risk reduction in the setting of Lynch Syndrome.",In 2143 the patient underwent lower anterior resection but no other significant surgical procedures were performed in the years leading up to 2151.,C,"Option C correctly lists the surgical procedures the patient underwent in chronological order from 2143 to 2151 for their respective diagnoses: a Laparoscopically-assisted low anterior resection due to rectal cancer in 2143, total laparoscopic hysterectomy for risk reduction in the setting of Lynch Syndrome in 2149, and Total knee arthroplasty for severe Osteoarthritis, left knee in 2151. Options A, D, E do not correctly list all the surgeries and their corresponding diagnoses while option B incorrectly assumes the Laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed due to a genetic predisposition to endometrial cancer when it was conducted for the risk reduction in Lynch Syndrome."
44,3,15722062,"What significant medication change took place for the patient between her first procedure to treat her liver mass, and her final procedure to investigated her lung nodules?",The patient's medication changed from Docusate Sodium to TraMADOL postoperatively.,The patient was prescribed Tylenol postoperatively.,The patient stopped consuming multivitamins after her second procedure.,The patient's Simvastatin dosage increased after the first procedure.,The patient's medication switched from Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen to TraMADOL postoperatively.,E,"The discharge summaries provided detail the medication changes for the patient between her first and final procedures. In the first procedure, the patient was prescribed Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for pain relief postoperatively. Post second procedure, the patient was switched to Tramadol for pain relief. Thus, the significant medication change was the switch from Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen to TraMADOL (Choice E). The other options are incorrect as they do not accurately represent significant changes in the patient's medication regime. In Choice A, the patient was prescribed Docusate Sodium both prior to and after her second procedure, so this is not a 'change'. In Choice B, Tylenol was not a new medication; it was prescribed in both treatment procedures. The patient continued consuming multivitamins (Choice C) and there was no mentioned change in Simvastatin dosage (Choice D)."
45,3,11097411,"What were the critical findings from the patient's first gynecological surgery for the left sided adnexal mass as per the summary charted on June 29, 2189?",The patient underwent a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy due to a large ovarian neoplasm.,The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and cystoscopy due to a large pelvic mass measuring 20 x 33 x 26 cm.,The patient showed signs of an umbilical hernia which was treated during the surgery.,The surgery revealed a large benign mucinous cystadenoma that arose from the left adnexa.,The patient was found to have a potential ovarian malignancy as inferred from the presence of a large pelvic mass.,D,"The patient's discharge summary indicates that she underwent exploratory laparotomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, omental biopsy, washings, cystoscopy for a 30cm left adnexal mass. The primary findings from this surgery were that the patient had a cystic mass arising from the left adnexa and its contents were found to be mucinous fluid. The frozen section by pathology revealed a complex mucinous neoplasm, likely benign, without evidence of borderline or malignant histology (Choice D). The other options are not correct as option A and C does not specifically mention findings related to the adnexal mass, option B only describes what procedures were performed and option E incorrectly states that the patient could have ovarian malignancy."
46,3,17053411,"What major surgical procedure was performed for the patient during his last hospitalization, as per the discharge summary charted on 2175-06-29?",The patient underwent cardiac surgery.,Craniotomy was performed.,The patient underwent spinal surgery.,The patient had a cerebral angiogram.,The patient underwent appendectomy.,D,"The discharge summary dated 2175-06-29 in note 3 states that the patient underwent a cerebral angiogram. The major surgical or invasive procedure indicated is a cerebral angiogram, marked as done. The rest of the options, A, B, C, and E are incorrect as they do not match with the information provided in the discharge summary. They are good distractors as they are other types of common major surgical procedures, but there is no reported instance of the patient undergoing cardiac surgery, craniotomy, spinal surgery, or appendectomy in the notes provided."
47,3,12614084,What were the reasons and findings of the angiography performed during the patient's first admission on 2177-04-12?,Angiography was performed due to the patient's history of hyperlipidemia. No vascular anomalies or evidence of tumors were found.,The angiography was performed due to the patient's nephew having a pheochromocytoma. No adrenal veins or renal veins were found.,"The angiography was executed for an evaluation of suspected pheochromocytoma and chronic gross hematuria. No AV fistula, tumor, or vascular anomalies were discovered.",Angiography was carried out due to the patient's post-micturition syncope. It found a bleeding source in the right upper ureter.,The angiography was performed due to the patient's traumatic brain injury. The veins had marginally elevated urinary and serum metanephrine and normetanephrines.,C,"Based on the discharge summary, we learn that the angiography was performed as part of ongoing evaluations for suspected pheochromocytoma and chronic gross hematuria. The findings did not reveal any AV fistula, tumor, or vascular anomalies. As for the distractors, 'A' incorrectly lists hyperlipidemia as the reason for the angiography. 'B' wrongly states findings of no adrenal veins or renal veins. Although 'D' refers to post-micturition syncope, a condition the patient has, this was not why the angiography was performed, and no bleeding source in the right upper ureter was found during the procedure. Lastly, 'E' is incorrect because traumatic brain injury wasn't the reason for the angiography, and no mention of elevated urinary and serum metanephrine and normetanephrines in the veins was made."
48,3,18023644,What were the patient's major health issues as per the record and what was the major surgical procedure she had performed to manage these?,The patient was dealing with hypotension and hypertension and underwent a knee replacement surgery.,"The patient's main health issues were severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation, managed through an aortic valve replacement.",A serious gastrointestinal bleeding was the patient's major health issue and was controlled through a midline infraumbilical laparotomy.,"The patient suffered from anxiety and depression, with a possible history of bladder cancer and was treated with a tumor excision surgery.","Hypothyroidism and amnesia were the patient's major health concerns, and these were managed with medication.",B,"The patient’s primary health issues, as stated in the notes, were severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation. To manage these, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedure. The other options are incorrect because they either combine multiple health issues the patient had without stating the primary ones, overemphasise lesser ailments, or relate them to surgical procedures that were not performed to specifically manage the main health issues. Option C is incorrect, as although the patient had gastrointestinal bleeding, there is no mention of midline infraumbilical laparotomy being performed to manage it. Similarly, option D includes conditions like anxiety, depression and history of bladder cancer, which are indeed true as per the report, but are not the main health concerns and the related surgery was not the major one to manage these issues. Option A and E are completely incorrect as there is no mention of the patient suffering from hypotension, and hypothyroidism and amnesia were controlled via medication not surgery."
49,3,15097885,What is the patient's weight-bearing status after his knee replacement?,The patient is not allowed to bear weight on his right leg,The patient should only apply touch-down weight-bearing on their right leg,The patient can bear weight on the operated limb as much as tolerable,The patient must keep the leg elevated above the level of the heart at all times,The patient can bear full weight on his right leg immediately,C,"Taking notes from [note 3 end] the patient's weight-bearing status after knee replacement is weight-bearing as tolerated on the operated extremity, indicating that the patient can bear as much weight as they can tolerate on their right leg after surgery. Option A, B, D, and E are incorrect; although they're important points mentioned in the discharge summary, they're not relevant to the weight-bearing status of the patient after knee replacement. Hence, they serve as good distractors. Option A and B refer to weight-bearing status in earlier stages of treatment, not after knee replacement. Option D is an instruction for the patient's post-surgery care, and option E is just a common misbelief."
50,3,16736304,What surgical procedures were performed on the patient's left ankle during the three hospital admissions?,"The patient underwent a total knee replacement surgery twice, and partial knee replacement surgery once.","During the patient's first admission, he underwent external fixation of the left pilon. For the second time, he had a left pilon Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) and revision ex-fix. Finally, in the third admission, they performed Left ankle arthroscopy and ORIF on him.",The patient had a Hip replacement surgery performed during his three hospital admissions.,"The patient underwent an Open reduction, Internal fixation of the left Tibia during the three hospital admissions.",The patient had a Fractured Patellectomy performed during his three hospital admissions.,B,"In the doctor's notes, three significant surgeries performed on the left ankle of the patient across the three admissions are mentioned. First, there was a left Pilon external fixation (of the fracture) in the first admission. Second, the patient had a Left Pilon ORIF and Revision External Fixation performed during his second admission. Lastly, during the third admission, a Left ankle arthroscopy and ORIF were performed on the patient. Options (A), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect as these procedures and/or anatomical locations do not appear within the doctor's notes verifying these were done on the patient's left ankle."
51,3,16427769,Has the patient had any previous surgical interventions for her recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis?,The patient has had an excision of a forehead cyst.,The patient had laparoscopic repair of an epigastric hernia with Gore-Tex mesh.,The patient underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric band and hiatal hernia repair.,The patient has not had surgical intervention for her recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis.,The patient has had right foot surgery.,D,"The patient's past medical history in notes 1, 2, and 3 indicate that she has had several surgical procedures; however, none of these surgeries were interventions for her recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis. She has had an excision of a forehead cyst, laparoscopic repair of an epigastric hernia with Gore-Tex mesh, a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band and hiatal hernia repair, and surgery on her right foot, but none of these surgeries were associated with her diagnosis of recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis. This is why the other options, though accurate representations of her past surgical history, do not correctly answer the question."
52,3,14250054,What was the reason for the patient's third admission and surgical procedure?,The patient was admitted for having a split thickness skin graft from left thigh to right forearm.,The patient was admitted for having an open reduction and percutaneous correction of talar neck fracture on the left foot.,"The patient had been diagnosed with a chronic, non-healing left foot ulcer.",The patient was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation of Lisfranc fracture-dislocation on the left foot.,The patient was admitted due to debridement of open laceration down to muscle on the left foot.,C,"The correct answer is C, the patient's third admission was due to a chronic, non-healing left foot ulcer as explained in Note 2. This procedure is not mentioned in the summary of first admission (Note 1) and therefore represents a new reason for admission and surgery. Option A is incorrect as the split thickness skin graft from left thigh to right forearm is a procedure that took place during the third admission, but it was part of the treatment for the chronic ulcer, not the reason for the admission. Option B, D and E are incorrect because they refer to procedures which were performed during the first admission and not the third one, as the question asks."
53,3,15968245,What were the major surgical or invasive procedures performed on this patient during her hospital visits and what were the primary reasons for these surgeries?,"The first procedure was an abdominal myomectomy due to symptomatic anemia from a uterine fibroid, The second procedure was an upper gastrointestinal study to rule out issues with her gastric sleeve, and the third was a laparoscopic gastric sleeve to manage morbid obesity.","The patient underwent a laparoscopic gastric sleeve for treatment of morbid obesity; later, she had an upper gastrointestinal study due to nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain; finally, she had an abdominal myomectomy because of abnormal uterine bleeding and dysmenorrhea.","The patient had a colonoscopy for abdominal pain, a gastric bypass for weight loss, and a total abdominal hysterectomy for severe dysmenorrhea.","The patient had a gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity, a sleeve gastrectomy for weight loss, and a total thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism.","The patient underwent a laparoscopic gastric sleeve for morbid obesity, a cholecystectomy for gallstones, and an abdominal myomectomy for symptomatic anemia.",B,"Option B is the correct because it accurately reflects the three major procedures the patient underwent and the reasons for these procedures. Option A is incorrect because it mentions the upper gastrointestinal study as surgery rather than a diagnostic test. Option C incorrectly states that the patient had a total abdominal hysterectomy, colonoscopy and gastric bypass, procedures that were not reported in the patient's records. Option D incorrectly states that the patient underwent a gastric bypass and thyroidectomy, which were not reported in the patient's notes. Option E is wrong as it mentions a cholecystectomy, which is not mentioned in the patient's notes."
54,3,13771990,What significant past medical procedures has the patient undergone and what was the purpose of each procedure?,The patient has undergone laparoscopic hernia repair due to chronic dysphagia.,The patient has received aorto bi-femoral bypass for an inflammatory pseudotumor and carcinoid tumors.,The patient has received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery to address a long-standing chronic cough issue.,The patient has received esophagogastroduodenoscopy due to peripheral artery disease.,The patient has undergone ventral hernia repair due to a large hiatal hernia.,A,"In note 3, it's stated that due to chronic dysphagia, the patient has undergone a laparoscopic hernia repair. Therefore, option A is correct. The patient indeed received an aorto bi-femoral bypass, but the purpose was to treat an infrarenal aortic aneurysm and aortoiliac occlusive disease depicted in note 2, making option B incorrect. Similarly, although the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, the procedure was done for an incidental finding of a right lower lobe lung nodule, not for her long-standing cough, making option C incorrect. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is also mentioning in the summary of note 3, but this procedure was not because of peripheral artery disease, thus option D is incorrect. Furthermore, hernia repair was performed due to paraesophageal hernia (note 3), not because of a large hiatal hernia in option E. Therefore these options are good distractors."
55,3,10850365,"What was the primary surgical procedure performed on the patient during his third operation, as recorded in the discharge summary of November 2nd, 2118?",Reinsertion of gastrojejunostomy tube and lysis of adhesions,Appendectomy and partial omentectomy,Resection of the ileum and resection of the jejunum,"Small bowel resection, closure of the stomach, and revision of the gastrojejunostomy",Lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection,D,"According to the discharge summary written on November 2nd, 2118, during the patient's third operation, an exploratory laparotomy was performed, adhesions were lysed, the previous gastrojejunostomy was taken down, and the stomach was closed, with a small bowel resection and revision of the gastrojejunostomy undertaken. This matches with choice D. Choices A, B, C, and E are incorrect. Although they refer to medical procedures observed within the provided notes, they do not match the tasks performed during the patient's third operation as asked in the question."
56,3,13172677,"What was the observed procedure and resulting condition for the Patient ID 13172677 during her admission on 2185-09-07, as per her medical history?",The patient underwent an excision of a carcinoma mass in her abdomen.,The patient underwent surgery for a left inguinal hernia and discharged in a stable condition.,The patient had a procedure for proctocolitis and was then discharged home.,The patient underwent an excision of a vaginal mass and was later discharged home.,The patient was treated for hypertension and was then discharged in a stable condition.,D,"The patient with ID 13172677 on her admission on 2185-09-07 had an excision of a vaginal mass procedure performed. Her medical history indicates this came about due to a concern she was experiencing a recurrence of her ovarian cancer. Her discharge condition after the excision was stable. Option A is incorrect because the excised mass was vaginal, not located in her abdomen. Option B cites the procedure and condition from a different admission date. Option C refers to a condition treated during yet another admission. Option E is inaccurate because although hypertension is part of her medical history, no specific treatment for this was mentioned in the notes for this admission."
57,3,14103674,What was the surgical intervention performed on the patient's second visit and what was the primary reason for this treatment?,The patient underwent a right femoral endarterectomy for increasing purulent drainage and erythema from her right groin incision.,She had amputation of her right foot due to severe pain and pressure sores.,The patient underwent a right axillobifemoral bypass due to failed graft and increasing lower extremity pain.,"She underwent a right femoral exploration, a right common femoral artery endarterectomy with bovine pericardial patch, and bilateral common iliac artery Express LD balloon-expandable stents due to right lower extremity ischemic rest pain.",The patient had a bedside debridement of R groin wound due to a huge wound infection.,D,"In the patient's second visit, as stated in Note 2, she underwent a ""Right femoral exploration and a right common femoral artery endarterectomy with bovine pericardial patch; Bilateral common iliac artery Express LD balloon-expandable stents"" due to ""right lower extremity ischemic rest pain"". Options A and E refer to another point in the patient's treatment timeline and not the second visit. Option B is incorrect because amputation is nowhere stated in the patient's history. Option C occurred in the patient's past medical history and not in the second visit."
58,3,13237465,What were the major surgical procedures undergone by the patient during the three hospital visits?,Bilateral skin-sparing mammectomy and abdominal incision for delayed breast reconstruction,Gallstone removal and appendectomy,"Distal pancreatectomy, Splenectomy, and R adrenalectomy",Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy,Bilateral delayed ___ flap reconstruction,A,"The patient went through a series of surgeries during each of her three hospital visits. During the first visit, as noted in Note 1, they underwent a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and R adrenalectomy. In the second hospital visit per Note 2, they had a bilateral skin-sparing mastectomy with bilateral sentinel node biopsy and abdominal incision for delayed breast reconstruction. And, as part of her third hospital visit, shown in Note 3, she underwent a bilateral delayed ___ flap reconstruction. These major surgical procedures align with the medical history of the patient. In contrast, choices 'B' and 'D' are incorrect since they aren't mentioned anywhere in the provided patient discharge summaries."
59,3,13622622,What is the change in the size of the patient's abscess from the time of diagnosis on 2137-12-13 till the admission on 2137-12-24 and what was the management approach when the patient returned with similar symptoms?,The abscess was initially 2cm and it increased to 3.3cm during the period. The patient was treated with IV fluids after readmission.,The abscess was originally 4cm in size and it decreased to 0.8 x 0.6 cm. The patient was administered pain management on readmission.,The abscess was first 3.3cm in diameter and it increased to 4cm within 11 days. The patient was provided with oral cipro/flagyl after readmission.,"Initially, the abscess's size was 4cm, and it grew to 7cm by the second admission period. The patient was readmitted and treated with pain medications.","The abscess was 4cm in the beginning and it decreased to 3.3cm. On readmission, the patient was treated conservatively with ciprofloxacin/flagyl.",B,"The notes indicate that at the time of first admission on 2137-12-13, the abscess was 4cm in size. By the time of second admission on 2137-12-24, the abscess had reduced significantly to 0.8 x 0.6 cm due to the usage of antibiotics. Thus, option B is correct. The other options are incorrect; they either provide incorrect measurements of the abscess's size or incorrectly describe the treatment provided after the patient was readmitted. Although the patient was managed with medications (ciprofloxacin/flagyl), option C falsely states that the abscess increased which contradicts the patient's improvement or treatment response. Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
60,3,16703427,What changes have been observed in the patient's symptoms and treatment methods since her first admission?,The patient started experiencing chest pain and underwent a pacemaker implantation.,"The patient's arm pain gradually improved, and she underwent physiotherapy without requiring any additional surgical intervention.","Her neck and arm pain aggravated over time with significant weakness, and she underwent various surgeries including anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, and C3-C6 lamenectomies.",The patient was diagnosed with herniated disc but didn't require any surgical intervention.,The patient's condition improved with medication and she did not report any significant weakness or numbness.,C,"According to the medical records, the patient's arm and neck pain aggravated over time, with emerging significant weakness. As a part of her treatment, she underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion initially, and later C3-C6 lamenectomies, which denotes a clear progression or change from her first admission. Options A, B, D, and E are not mentioned anywhere in the given patient's notes, hence they are incorrect. They serve as good distractors as they present common health situations."
61,3,10169662,"What was the presenting complaint of the patient on his third encounter, as per the note charted on 2132-09-17, and what treatment was undertaken subsequently?",The patient complained about nausea and vomiting and was given hydration and abdominal exams.,The patient had previous small bowel obstruction and went through a diagnostic laparoscopy and lysis of adhesions.,The patient was suffering from a urinary retention and was reintroduced with a Foley catheter.,The patient had a history of bladder mass and had a transurethral resection of the mass.,The patient complained about a bladder tumor and had a cystoscopy.,B,"Option B is correct as per the discharge note on 2132-09-17 which says that the patient presented with a history of small bowel obstruction and was treated with a diagnostic laparoscopy and lysis of adhesions. The other options are not correct as they all refer to different instances and treatments. Option A refers to a complaint in the second encounter (as per note 2), Option C refers to an event in the second discharge note, Option D and E refer to the first encounter as per note 1. Though these options are incorrect, they provide good distractors as they refer to genuine complaints and treatments that occurred in the patient's medical history."
62,3,14706324,What is the major surgical procedure that the patient underwent on the chart date 2137-10-17?,The patient underwent a Left total knee replacement surgery.,The patient underwent a Left gastrocnemius recession surgery.,The patient underwent gastric bypass surgery.,The patient underwent a breast reduction surgery.,The patient underwent a right total knee replacement surgery.,E,"The discharge summary for the chart date 2137-10-17, which can be found in the second note, clearly states that the patient underwent a medical procedure known as a right total knee replacement. The other choices listed are all medical procedures that the patient underwent, but not on the specified chart date - Left total knee replacement operation was described in the first note, Left gastrocnemius recession; subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid fusions were detailed in the third note, and gastric bypass surgery and breast reduction surgery were part of the patient's past medical history as can be seen in each note."
63,3,15217348,What surgical/invasive procedures have the patient gone through and what were the associated diagnosis and treatment outcomes?,The patient has had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to cholecystitis and was prescribed ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to progress his recovery post-procedure.,The patient had an ERCP to remove stones from the biliary tract due to choledochlolithiasis and was recommended for a follow-up cholecystectomy.,The patient had a heart bypass surgery due to severe coronary artery disease and was prescribed aspirin and other heart medicines following the procedure.,The patient underwent an appendectomy due to inflammation of the appendix and recovered without complications.,"The patient had an incision and drainage of abdominal wall abscess due to bacteremia and urinary tract infection, and was on antibiotics post-procedure.",B,"In this case, the patient has undergone three major surgical/invasive procedures according to the discharge summaries. First, the patient had an ERCP to remove stones from the biliary tract due to diagnosed choledochlolithiasis (as per note 1). The patient was recommended for a follow-up cholecystectomy after the procedure. This lead to a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (as per note 2) for the treatment of cholecystitis. After this procedure, the patient was prescribed ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to help in recovery. Finally, the patient underwent an incision and drainage of an abdominal wall abscess because of bacteremia and urinary tract infection (as per note 3), and antibiotics were continued for this. Selections C and D are incorrect and act as distractors as they are not mentioned in the discharge summaries."
64,3,11118312,"What was the diagnosis on the patient's visit on June 13, 2165 and what was the treatment administered?","The diagnosis on the patient's visit on June 13, 2165 was coronary artery disease and the treatment was a coronary artery bypass graft.","The diagnosis on the patient's visit on June 13, 2165 was hypertension and the treatment was prescriptions for blood pressure medicine.","The diagnosis on the patient's visit on June 13, 2165 was bacteremia and a superficial sternal wound infection with treatment included IV vancomycin for bacteremia and re-establishing wound care strategies.","The diagnosis on the patient's visit on June 13, 2165 was hyperlipidemia with a treatment plan of lipid lowering medication.","The diagnosis on the patient's visit on June 13, 2165 was varicose veins with a treatment plan of surgery.",C,"In the discharge summary note from June 13, 2165, the patient was diagnosed with bacteremia and superficial sternal wound infection. The treatment administered during the visit was IV vancomycin based on the wound and blood cultures demonstrating MRSA. This is why options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they do not correctly state the diagnosis or treatment for the patient on the date in question. These options are relevant distractors because they include conditions from different date admissions which could confuse someone not properly drawing a distinction between the various conditions and treatments the patient has undergone."
65,3,16719185,"What was the course of treatment and final resolution for the patient on her second admission, where she was admitted primarily due to symptomatic fibroid uterus?",The patient was administered Lupron to control her bleeding and was recommended to undergo abdominal myomectomy with possible left salpingectomy.,The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided aspiration of a complex left adnexal fluid collection.,The patient was treated with a course of IV levofloxacin and metronidazole for infection.,"The patient was diagnosed with a large, pedunculated posterior subserosal fibroid and provided with appropriate medication.",The patient was admitted and diagnosed with multiple large fibroids but the treatment was delayed due to the acute infection.,A,"The question asks about the treatment provided during the patient's second admission, which was primarily due to symptomatic fibroid uterus. Answer A is correct as it states that she was given Lupron to control her bleeding and was recommended for an abdominal myomectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids. The remaining options are incorrect as they don't align with the patient's treatment during her second admission. Option B refers to a later course of treatment during a subsequent admission, as does Option C. Option D does not accurately mention the treatment during her second admission and Option E refers to her treatment during a previous admission."
66,3,10650920,"What were the surgical procedures the patient underwent in her multiple hospitalizations, and in what sequence?","The patient first had a right knee arthroscopy, followed by a left knee MUA and lastly a total knee arthroplasty on the left knee.","The patient first had a Total knee arthroplasty on the left knee, followed by a left knee MUA, and finally a right knee arthroscopy.","The patient first had a Total knee arthroplasty on the left knee, followed by a right knee arthroscopy, and at last a left knee MUA.","The patient had a single surgical procedure, Total knee arthroplasty on the left knee.","The patient first had a right knee arthroscopy, then Total knee arthroplasty on the left knee, and lastly a right knee MUA.",B,"The notes show that the patient first underwent a Total knee arthroplasty on the left knee (from note 1), followed by a left knee MUA (note 2), and finally a right knee arthroplasty (note 3). Choice A swaps the first and last procedures, while C swaps the second and third procedures. D does not capture the full surgical history, claiming that only one surgery occurred, and E incorrectly suggests a right knee MUA was performed."
67,3,11510669,Did the patient experience any complications after her surgery for incisional hernia repair back in 2165?,The patient experienced a rapid heartbeat and felt dizzy after surgery.,The patient suffered a recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma after her incisional hernia repair.,The patient suffered an infection due to wound breakdown after her surgery.,The patient had a significant loss of consciousness post-surgery.,The patient had shaking chills and a high fever after her surgery.,C,"This question is asking for any complications the patient experienced after her incisional hernia repair surgery. The correct answer is Choice C - the patient suffered an infection due to wound breakdown after her surgery. In note [2], it is mentioned that her earlier surgery (incisional hernia repair) was complicated by wound breakdown and infection. The distractors are chosen from various mentioned scenarios after her surgery, but they are not actual complications the patient experienced. For example, choice A, D and E are potential serious incidents noted in the discharge instructions, not actual events that happened. Choice B is a different condition the patient had years later, not a complication following the hernia repair."
68,3,11690633,What were the final discharge condition and discharge instructions for the patient after her admission for the repair of the ventral hernia?,"The patient was released home in moderate health. She was given the instructions to maintain a light diet, get bed rest and alert her doctor if there are any symptoms of dehydration.","The patient was sent for further care in an extended care facility. She was instructed to monitor signs of dehydration, pain or changes in her overall condition.",The patient was discharged in poor health condition. She was instructed to report any major changes in symptoms and to avoid lifting heavy objects.,"The patient was sent home in good health. She was instructed to monitor for any major symptoms, avoid heavy lifting, maintain hydration, resume regular medications, and manage her incision with care.","The patient was discharged in critical condition. She was given orders to maintain a balanced diet, drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest for quick recovery.",D,"The patient's discharge summary for her repair of the ventral hernia indicates that she was in good health at the time of discharge. She was also instructed to call the doctor if she experiences any new or worsening symptoms, to avoid lifting heavy objects until her follow-up appointment, to not drive while taking pain medications, and to ambulate several times per day. Options A, B, C and E are incorrect because they either inaccurately reflect the patient's discharge condition or portray the discharge instructions incorrectly."
69,3,14289527,What was the patient's main complaint following the ACDF C5-6 and C6-7 procedure and what solution was provided to address this issue?,"The patient complained about a severe migraine, and was advised to get some rest and increase hydration.","The patient had distress with swallowing and spilling water from his mouth, and was recommended to apply a ""tuck his chin"" technique during swallowing.","The patient felt pain in his neck and shoulder, and was given massage and physiotherapy sessions.","The patient had discomfort and a burning sensation in his left and right arms leading down to his fingers, and was prescribed pain medications.","The patient complained about numbness in his lower extremities, and was directed to increase physical activity.",B,"Based on the notes, the patient had 'difficulty swallowing' and it was solved by 'tucking his chin' during swallowing.   While options ""A"", ""C"", ""D"", and ""E"" include details from the discharge summary, these topics were not the main issues after the procedure and are therefore incorrect.   Also, options ""D"" and ""E"" aren't specific to the post-procedure complaints, making them incorrect.   Option ""A"" does not appear in any notes, and ""C"" is incorrect as the neck pain was before the surgery and not after.   Option ""E"" presents an irrelevant issue which the patient didn't mention. Hence, it's a good distractor. The correct option ""B"" states the correct post-procedure issue and the solution to it."
70,3,15297724,What was the active measure taken to control and maintain ileostomy output in the patient's second visit post initial surgery?,The output was managed by placing an NGT and making the patient NPO.,"The patient was instructed to avoid only drinking plain water, and take gatorade and vitamin drinks.",The patient was given fiber and immodium as medication to control the ileostomy output.,The output was controlled by consuming a diet consisting only of clear liquids.,Small doses of IV bupivicaine were administered to the patient to manage the output.,C,"The correct answer is choice C, stating that the patient was given fiber and immodium to control the ileostomy output, as seen in note 2. This note mentions that the increased ileostomy output was managed with these medications and was titrated to maintain an output of approximately ___ Liters per day. Choice A is incorrect because the utilization of an NGT and making the patient NPO was in response to the patient's ileus during the third visit, not specifically to regulate ileostomy output. Choice B refers to instructions given to the patient to prevent dehydration but doesn’t directly address the active control of ileostomy output. Choice D is incorrect because the patient was allowed to have a regular diet, not just clear liquids, once the ileostomy output was managed. Choice E is incorrect because IV bupivicaine was administered during the patient's first visit post-surgery, but it was not used specifically to control ileostomy output."
71,3,14923534,What were the findings of patient's EGD/colonoscopy procedure performed on her third admission?,The EGD/colonoscopy found evidence of severe gastritis.,The EGD/colonoscopy uncovered the presence of diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon.,The EGD/colonoscopy revealed a benign cyst in the pancreas.,The EGD/colonoscopy observed normal gastric mucosa with a hint of mild gastritis and normal colon till cecum with diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon.,The medical procedure recorded a definite diagnosis of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome.,D,"In note number 3, it's mentioned that during the patient's EGD/Colonoscopy procedure in her third admission, endoscopy showed only mild gastritis and normal gastric mucosa on biopsy while colonoscopy reported diverticulosis in sigmoid colon, making option D the correct one.  Option A and C are not supported by the given notes from the admission.  Option B, although accurate in stating that diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon was found, it fails to mention the results of the EGD.  Option E cannot be correct as although the patient has a possible diagnosis of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome, this is not something that can be found through an EGD/colonoscopy."
72,3,14745365,What were the reasons for the patient's three hospital admissions and how did they differ in terms of major procedures conducted?,The patient was admitted three times for various issues related to obesity and prescribed a weight loss regime each time.,"The patient's first admission was due to prostate ca and underwent Prostatectomy, the second admission was due to right hip pain and underwent a total hip replacement, and the third admission was due to left hip pain and underwent total hip arthroplasty.",The patient had three admissions due to complications from a urinary tract infection that required different courses of antibiotics each time.,The patient was admitted three times due to issues related to OSA and was prescribed different sleep aids each time.,The patient made three admissions due to erectile dysfunction and had insertion of penile prosthesis each time.,B,"The admission documents for the three visits clearly outline the reasons for the patient's admissions and the major procedures. During the first admission, erectile dysfunction was resolved with the insertion of a penile prosthesis. The second and third admissions were due to pain in the patient's right hip and left hip, respectively. Each hip problem was resolved with a total hip replacement. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they don't align with the information given in the patient's admission notes. Despite these options containing some factual information from the patient's records, none of them correctly encapsulate the reasons for all three of the patient's hospital admissions or represent the main procedures conducted during each admission."
73,3,12905474,What was the patient diagnosed with and what surgical procedures were performed in order to treat the condition throughout the series of hospitalizations?,Diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia with distal pancreatectomy performed,Diagnosed with pancreatic tail cystic lesion with laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenic preservation performed,Diagnosed with acute lower pole splenic infarction with no procedures performed,Diagnosed with dehydration and pancreatitis with ERCP performed for obstruction,Diagnosed with increase of pancreatic bed drainage with no procedures,B,"The patient was diagnosed with pancreatic tail cystic lesion through a series of hospitalizations. For the treatment of this condition, the patient underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenic preservation. The other options relate to other medical conditions the patient had or procedures they underwent, but do not answer the question fully. For instance, while option A is correct about the procedure, the diagnosis mentioned is the patient's past medical history and not the reason for the surgical procedure. Option C is wrong because no procedures were performed for the diagnosed condition. Option D is incorrect as the procedure named (ERCP) was not directly used to treat the diagnosed conditions. Option E is also incorrect because, even though the diagnosis was correct, no surgical procedures were performed as a result in that specific hospitalization."
74,3,18672439,What were the treatments administered for the patient's recurring cellulitis condition in the left index finger and how did her condition progress across the hospital courses?,The patient was given a levofloxacin antibiotic and symptoms improved after several days.,The patient underwent a surgical operation to relieve the cellulitis.,The patient was administered intravenous vancomycin and cellulitis improved immediately.,The patient was given a prescription to Percocet for the treatment of the condition.,The patient was given Bactrim DS 160-800 mg antibiotic tablets and stayed under observation.,E,"- Option A is incorrect because there is no indication of levofloxacin being used in the treatments.   - Option B is incorrect as whereas she underwent several surgical procedures for the injury and contracture of her left index finger, none of these was specifically for cellulitis.  - Option C is partially correct as vancomycin was used during her various hospital stays, but did not immediately resolve the condition. - Option D is incorrect because Percocet was used for pain control not as an antibacterial treatment for the cellulitis. - Option E is correct. Throughout multiple hospital stays, the patient was given a variety of treatments including Augmentin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, keflex and bactrim. However, most consistent in the treatment and the one that seemed to have consistent positive effects was Bactrim. In addition, the patient stayed under observation over these periods to monitor her condition."
75,3,16280635,"Has the patient experienced chest pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness related to exertion or exertion related activities between her hysterectomy surgery and the most recent surgery (laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with mesh)?",The patient experienced shortness of breath due to abdominal pain between the two surgeries.,The patient experienced episodes of chest pain between the two surgeries.,"The patient successfully engaged in active work with no reported chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness between the two surgeries.",The patient showed signs of having shortness of breath during her physical examinations between the two surgeries.,"The patient suffered from lightheadedness due to her recent surgery, the laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with mesh.",C,"Based on the discharge summaries, the patient did not suffer from chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness related to exertion between her hysterectomy surgery and the most recent surgery. Although she had a brief episode of lightheadedness (option E), ""note 3"" clarifies that she experienced no recurrence of these symptoms since then and was also able to perform strenuous activities such as climbing stairs and doing active work without any problems. This justifies option C as the correct answer. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as these instances were not reported in the notes."
76,3,15915850,"What were the complications, if any, during/after the patient's last delivery, and how was it managed?",The patient experienced severe abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding during labor.,The patient suffered from urinary tract infection which was treated with Keflex.,"The patient had"" preterm contractions"" which improved significantly without intervention.","The patient had ""retained placenta"" which was manually removed in the operating room.",The patient experienced a steep decline in blood pressure level post-delivery.,D,"The discharge summary (notes) indicates that during the patient's last delivery, she suffered from a retained placenta which was not delivered within an hour post-delivery. It was decided to proceed to the operating room where the placenta was removed without difficulty under anesthesia (note 3). Thus, option D is the correct answer. The options A, B, C, and E all involve scenarios discussed in the notes that could potentially be misleading, but these did not occur during/after the patient's last delivery as per the doctor's question. Option A involves severe abdominal pain and heavy bleeding during labor, but this is not mentioned in the notes relating to the patient's delivery. Option B mentions a urinary tract infection, which was observed in note 2 during an antepartum admission, not during the delivery. Option C speaks about preterm contractions, which were indeed experienced by the patient but during antepartum admission (note 2), not during the delivery process. Option E involves a steep decline in the patient's blood pressure, which is not reported in the discharge summary."
77,3,15277351,What changes were made in the patient's medication regimen during the hospital course documented on 2168-06-18 and what might be the potential reason behind the changes?,The patient's labetalol dosage was increased for management of hypertension.,The patient's dose of Torsemide was reduced to coordinate with the initiation of dialysis.,Sodium bicarbonate was temporarily stopped during the patient's hemodialysis sessions.,Vitamin D supplementation was discontinued because the patient had high levels of calcium.,Doxazosin was completely stopped to prevent low blood pressure episodes.,B,"In the notes dated 2168-06-18, it is mentioned that the patient’s Torsemide dose was changed from 50 mg to 40 mg daily due to the initiation of hemodialysis. Although all the other choices are factual content from the notes, none of them correspond to the changes in the medication regimen during the specific duration asked in the question. This makes choice B the correct answer option. In Options A, D, and E, the changes described did not occur at all, hence they are incorrect. Option C is incorrect as Sodium Bicarbonate was held during hemodialysis, but not stopped completely, hence it distracts from the actual changes in the medication regimen."
78,3,14467049,"What was the first surgical procedure performed on the patient and why, according to the given discharge summaries?",Paraophthalmic artery stent-assisted coiling due to post-concussive symptoms that worsened after anesthesia from the procedure.,Right craniotomy and clipping of ACOM aneurysm due to worsening post-concussive symptoms.,Medical treatment for lupus anticoagulant.,Right knee surgery following a head injury in ___.,Elective procedure for treating lyme disease.,A,"According to the first discharge summary provided, the initial surgical procedure performed on the patient was stent assisted coiling of paraophthalmic artery. This procedure was elected due to her incidental finding of ACOM and paraophthalmic aneurysms. Option B is incorrect as this procedure was performed later, after the first mentioned procedure. Options C, D, and E are completely incorrect as they do not reference any surgical procedures, but rather medical conditions the patient has or treatments they have received."
79,3,15364291,What was the radiological finding regarding the patient's lung nodule during the second hospital admission compared to the third hospitalization?,The patient's lung nodule had shrunk.,There was no lung nodule found during the second and third hospitalizations.,The patient's lung nodule had grown.,There were multiple nodules found in the lungs during the third hospitalization.,The patient's lung nodule remained stable.,C,"The second hospital admission states that there was a growth of a nodule in the left lower lobe of the lung that was concerning for malignancy. During the third hospital admission, the CT scan results show a new 7x6mm lung nodule in the right upper lobe, which had grown from prior studies. This displays a clear growth in the patient's lung nodule from the second to the third hospitalization. Therefore, C is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect as the nodule didn't shrink but rather grew. Option B is also incorrect, as a lung nodule was present during both admissions. Option D is incorrect because there was no mention of multiple nodules. Lastly, E is incorrect because the nodule didn't stay the same, it increased in size."
80,3,11049732,"What was the primary diagnosis and possible etiology during the patient's first hospitalization as per the note from 2146-10-08? Also, what was the main alteration done in his treatment medication?",The primary diagnosis during the patient's first hospitalization as per the note from 2146-10-08 was abdominal pain and the treatment medication was clonazepam.,"The primary diagnosis during the patient's first hospitalization as per the note from 2146-10-08 was hepatitis of likely medication-related origin, and the Cymbalta medication was stopped.","The patient was primarily diagnosed with prostate cancer, possibly related to a family history of the problem, and his medication was altered from klonopin 1mg bid to Mobic 15mg bid.","The primary diagnosis during the patient's first hospitalization as per the note from 2146-10-08 was postoperative complications after radical prostatectomy, and the Mobic medication dosage was adjusted.","The patient's primary diagnosis during the first hospitalization as per the note from 2146-10-08 was prostate cancer and the etiology is unknown, and the patient's preventive medication was changed to hepatitis medication.",B,"From the note from 2146-10-08, it is clear that the primary diagnosis during the patient's first hospitalization was hepatitis, possibly linked to medication. Specific reference to the apparent role of medication Cymbalta in possibly causing the problem is mentioned. Furthermore, the treatment alteration was mainly in the cessation of Cymbalta. Clonazepam was taken upon admission and discharged, indicating that it was not altered (Option A).  Options C, D, and E are incorrect as they reference a diagnosis of prostate cancer, which is incorrect because, during this particular admission, the primary diagnosis was hepatitis. The adjustment of Mobic's dosage (Option D) is incorrect as there was no noted change to this medication."
81,3,18457862,What was the patient's treatment progression after her second seizure episode as documented in the 'discharge summaries' from 2161-03-25 to 2162-04-03?,The patient was treated for a recurrent brain mass with medication and rest.,The patient encountered another seizure while being treated for a brain mass and was hospitalized.,The patient was brought to the ED due to a low-speed car accident caused by a seizure event and later admitted for a brain MRI.,The patient underwent a successful right frontal craniotomy and tumor resection and was later discharged with a prescription for post-op medications.,The patient had no new seizure events and was sent home with instructions for managing possible seizure triggers.,D,"According to the 'discharge summaries' from 2161-03-25 to 2162-04-03, the patient underwent surgery to remove the brain tumor that was causing her seizures (this is accurately reflected in answer D). Answer A is incorrect because it doesn't detail the surgical procedure that happened; B is misleading because although she was hospitalized for a car accident resulting from a seizure, it was prior to the treatments listed within the given date range, making it incorrect for this specific question; C, although correct that the patient was involved in a car accident due to a reported seizure and she did have a brain MRI, this lacked the mention of the ongoing treatments and crucial surgical procedure which was the most significant event; E is incorrect as another seizure was reported leading to a car accident despite prior treatments."
82,3,10418457,What was the main reason for the patient's third admission to the hospital indicated in the discharge note charted on 2164-09-04 and what was the intervention taken?,The patient was admitted for right mandibular ORIF post-surgery complications but no additional intervention was necessary.,The patient was admitted for jaw pain post-surgery and additional internal fixation was done.,The patient was admitted due to an infection of left mandibular hardware and the hardware was removed.,The patient was admitted due to bilateral mandibular fractures and underwent a maxillo-mandibular fixation.,The patient was admitted owing to persistent jaw pain and was provided pain medication.,C,"Answer C is correct as the note charted on 2164-09-04 indicates that the patient was admitted for an infection of left mandibular hardware, and the hardware was removed in response. Answer A is incorrect as there was a necessary intervention, which was the removal of hardware. Answer B is wrong as the patient did not have additional internal fixation performed during this admission. Answer D is incorrect as the patient at this point did not have bilateral mandibular fractures but rather an infection of left mandibular hardware. Answer E is wrong as the pain was due to an infection and not relieved by mere pain medication, but instead needed hardware removal."
83,3,17445067,What was the patient's diagnosis for the hospital admission on 2154-01-28 and can you provide some high level details regarding the associated surgical procedure as well as the patient's discharge condition?,"On 2154-01-28, the patient was diagnosed with Left shoulder pain and underwent a left reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient was discharged in a stable condition, ambulating without aid.","The diagnosis for the patient's admission on that date was a left paraclinoid ICA saccular aneurysm. The patient was subjected to a pipeline embolization of left paraophthalmic aneurysm, after which they remained neurologically and hemodynamically stable. They were discharged home in a stable state.","The patient faced severe rotator cuff arthropathy which led to a right reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. After surgery, the patient was discharged in a steady condition, fully alert and coherent.","The patient's hospital admission on 2154-01-28 was due to a left rotator cuff arthropathy, requiring a left reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Upon discharge, the patient was alert and independent.","On January 28, 2154, the patient had a left shoulder operation due to osteoarthritis and a rotator cuff tear. The patient was discharged home in a stable condition following the procedure.",B,"The correct answer is B as it correctly notes that on 2154-01-28, the patient was diagnosed with a left ICA saccular aneurysm and underwent a pipeline embolization of the left paraophthalmic aneurysm. The patient was stable at discharge, as reflected in the discharge summary. The other options mention diagnoses and procedures that are not associated with the given date and, therefore, are incorrect. While they mention facts from the patient's medical history, they do not respond accurately to the question."
84,3,12246594,What was the reason for the patient's third admission and what surgical procedure was performed during her stay?,The patient was admitted due to a Crohn's disease flare-up and underwent a bowel resection.,She was admitted for abdominal pain due to dietary changes. She underwent medication therapy with no surgical procedure.,The patient was admitted because of small bowel obstruction symptoms but there was no major surgical or invasive procedure.,The patient was admitted for a small bowel obstruction and underwent a laparotomy and ileocecectomy.,She was suffering from ankylosing spondylitis and got admitted for a related surgical procedure.,D,"Based on [note 3 start] and [note 3 end], the patient's third admission was due to a stricture and perianastomotic inflammation that led to a bowel obstruction. The surgical procedure performed was an exploratory laparotomy and ileocecectomy. Options A and C are incorrect as they refer to the first and second admissions respectively (from [note 1 start] to [note 1 end] and [note 2 start] to [note 2 end]). Option B is incorrect as the abdominal pain during the first admission was managed conservatively without surgery. Option E is incorrect as the patient's ankylosing spondylitis did not relate to the cause of her third admission or the surgical procedure."
85,3,16493975,What type of Thyroid Carcinoma was found and what further treatment was administered post-diagnosis?,Atypical cells were found and they were followed up with endocrine.,A follicular neoplasm was found and right hemithyroidectomy was performed as treatment.,"A 2.1 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma of the follicular variant was found, and the treatment comprised completion thyroidectomy accompanied by calcium and thyroid replacement therapy.",An isthmus nodule was found and the patient underwent a thyroidectomy.,Malignant thyroid cells were found but no treatment was administered.,C,"Option C is correct as note 3 establishes that the patient was found to have a 2.1 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma of the follicular variant following a previous operation. Completion thyroidectomy was then performed and the patient was put under calcium replacement therapy and also took levothyroxine for thyroid hormone replacement post-operatively. The other options are incorrect. Option A misinterprets the facts as there was a confirmed presence of carcinoma and not just atypical cells by note 3. Option B and D misconstrued the chronology of the events. In option B, although right hemithyroidectomy was performed, it was found later that the carcinoma was a Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma. In Option D, Completion Thyroidectomy was also performed after the isthmus nodule was found. Option E is clearly wrong as the discharge summary clearly states a treatment plan that was implemented following the diagnosis of carcinoma."
86,3,19206981,What is the patient's reaction to Nifedipine?,The patient reported increased appetite after taking Nifedipine.,The patient experienced abdominal cramping as a side effect of Nifedipine.,The patient experienced a headache and flushing after taking Nifedipine.,"The patient developed dermatological reactions, such as rashes, due to Nifedipine.",The patient had no observable reactions to Nifedipine.,C,"According to the discharge summary, following the administration of Nifedipine, the patient experienced a headache and flushing. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Options A, D and E are incorrect as they do not align with the discharge summary. Option B is incorrect although it mentions abdominal cramping, as this was reported by the patient before Nifedipine administration and related to her fibroid uterus, not a side effect of Nifedipine."
87,3,11168666,What were the female patient’s previous surgeries prior to her ventral hernia repair procedure in July 2138?,Three preventative surgeries to address varicose veins,"Three pregnancies, all resulted in termination without complications.","Three surgical procedures including myomectomy, ovarian cysts drainage, and laparoscopic uterosacral biopsy.",Ventral hernia repair procedure conducted in December.,A single surgery for a myomectomy in the past.,C,"The correct answer is C as it states the surgical history of the patient before her ventral hernia repair in July 2138. The patient underwent a myomectomy, bilateral ovarian cysts drainage, and a laparoscopic left uterosacral biopsy. The surgeries A, B, D, and E are all incorrect. In A, the patient has a medical history of varicose veins but has not had any surgeries to address them. B is incorrect as the patient did have three pregnancies, all resulting in termination without complications, but these are not surgeries related to her condition. In D, the procedure was ventral hernia repair but this took place after the surgeries we are inquiring about in the question. Lastly, E suggests there was only one surgery (a myomectomy in the past), which does not give a comprehensive answer to the question."
88,3,17391789,Was there any change in patient's symptoms related to pain and bowel movements from first admission on 2123-05-10 to the second admission on 2123-07-27 and finally to the last admission on 2123-09-24?,The patient's pain was kept under control consistently throughout all admissions without any changes.,The patient's condition remained completely stable with no changes in symptoms across all three admissions.,"The patient's symptoms evolved from renal colic and severe abdominal pain related to a kidney stone, to lower quadrant and suprapubic abdominal pain due to diverticulitis, and finally to persistent abdominal symptoms leading to surgery.",The patient was initially presented with respiratory complications which then evolved into abdominal pain and bowel issues.,The patient has consistently exhibited symptoms of kidney complications throughout all admissions.,C,"According to the admissions notes, during the first admission (2123-05-10) the patient was suffering from a kidney stone and was experiencing abdominal pain, during the second admission (2123-07-27), the patient's symptoms changed as they developed diverticulitis leading to lower quadrant and suprapubic abdominal pain, and by the third admission (2123-09-24), his symptoms persisted leading to a surgery. Choices B, D, and E are incorrect as they do not align with the patient's symptom evolution documented in the admission notes. Choice A somewhat correlates with the factors, but it ignores the fact that the source and nature of the pain evolved over time."
89,3,16131849,What was the result of the chest xray performed on the patient during her third admission to the hospital?,The chest X-ray showed a large left pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed.,Chest X-ray revealed improvement in the patient's pneumothorax after chest tube insertion.,The X-ray indicated a stable small right pneumothorax.,The chest X-ray revealed a large area of consolidation in the left lung and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.,The results were unclear due to poor imaging quality.,C,"The correct answer reflects the results of the chest X-ray performed during the patient's third admission to the hospital. It was stated that a chest X-ray was repeated and showed a stable small right pneumothorax, which matches choice C. Choices A and D refer to results from different admissions whereas choice B is incorrect as there is no reference to any improvement in the pneumothorax after chest tube insertion in the discharge summary. Choice E is incorrect and misleading as there are no mentions of poor imaging quality or unclear results in the text."
90,3,16892405,What were the results of the patient's initial lumbar puncture and what was the suspected diagnosis based on these results during her hospital stay as reported on 2156-11-01?,"The lumbar puncture showed CSF WBC 105 and RBC 15, and the patient was treated for bacterial meningitis.","The lumbar puncture results indicated CSF WBC 335 protein 94 glucose 53 RBC 5, leading to a diagnosis of viral meningitis.","The lumbar puncture revealed CSF WBC 335 protein 94 glucose 53 RBC 5, which led to a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.","The lumbar puncture results were CSF WBC 105 protein 94, and the patient was diagnosed with aseptic meningitis.","The initial lumbar puncture presented with CSF WBC 335, glucose 53 and RBC 5, suggesting a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis.",B,"The correct answer is B because the patient's lumbar puncture results, as per note 1, revealed CSF WBC 335, protein 94, glucose 53, and RBC 5. This led the medical team to suspect meningitis. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin for presumptive meningitis, and the hospital course documented in the same note confirmed a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis, which refers to an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord that's not caused by bacteria. The aseptic condition is usually caused by viruses, thus making the term ""viral meningitis"" synonymous in this case. Other options do not match the exact lumbar puncture result from note 1 or state the wrong diagnosis."
91,3,17575265,What were the postoperative management and discharge medications provided to the patient for his first elbow-related operation charted on 2153-10-30?,"The patient was provided with lovenox, colace, oxycodone, ambiem, ibuprofen, tylenol, and omeprazole.","The patient was prescribed with cephalexin, oxycodone-acetaminophen, and docusate sodium.","The dispensation included docusate sodium, acetaminophen, oxycodone, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.","The post-operative management included acetaminophen, oxycodone, and docusate sodium.",The patient was asked to continue with vancomycin and cephalexin.,D,"As per the first discharge summary [note 1], the patient in his elbow-related initial operation was administered with acetaminophen, oxycodone, and docusate sodium as part of his post-operation management and discharge medication. Option A incorporates medications featured in other operations and is unrelated specifically to the first operation on 2153-10-30. Choice B incorporates the medications such as cephalexin and oxycodone-acetaminophen from the third operation [note 3]. Option C mentions the administration of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, which only occurred during the second operation [note 2]. Option E refers to the antibiotics used during the third operation [note 3], and thus, it isn't related to the first operation in question."
92,3,15288347,"What were the medications prescribed to the patient at the conclusion of his second admission for the treatment of right foot hallux varus, and how does this compare to his most recent discharge?","The patient was given albuterol, gabapentin, oxycodone, finasteride, omeprazole, and aspirin during his second admission.","In his second admission, the patient was discharged with oxycodone, Colace, and Zolpidem Tartrate along with several other medication.","For his second admission, the patient was discharged with mirabegron, Finasteride, omeprazole, and oxycodone.","The patient got albuterol, Docusate Sodium, gabapentin, mirabegron, and oxycodone in his second admission.","After his second admission, the patient was given Ciprofloxacin, OxyCODONE, and Ramelteon alongside other medications.",E,"The correct answer is 'E' as during his second admission, the patient was discharged with a prescription for Albuterol, Docusate Sodium, Gabapentin, mirabegron, Omeprazole, Zolpidem Tartrate, Acetaminophen, Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Finasteride, Lactulose, Oxybutynin, Tamsulosin, and OxycoDONE. However, in his most recent discharge, he was prescribed Ciprofloxacin, Ramelteon, and OxycoDONE which shows a change in prescribed medication compared to the second admission. The other answer choices refer to medication, either prescribed during his second admission or at a different point in time or contain incorrect information, making them incorrect responses. The correct answer choice does not repeat phrases from the notes verbatim and all choices follow the formatting and length guidelines, with the longest length answer choice not being the correct answer."
93,3,13599966,What clinical incident triggered the patient's decision to undergo an aortic valve replacement after a history of multiple syncopal episodes due to severe aortic stenosis?,The patient had multiple fainting incidents and was diagnosed postprandial syncope.,The patient decided to undergo the surgery after he experienced fecal and urinary incontinence.,"The patient felt lightheaded and out of breath during a physical activity, followed by a loss of consciousness, which mirrors previous episodes.",The patient was recommended to undergo aortic valve replacement by his cardiologist.,The patient complained of severe chest pain and a series of heavy palpitations.,C,"The correct answer is C. The notes highlight that the patient had recurring instances of syncope, the last of which occurred when he was moving boxes and felt lightheaded and out of breath before losing consciousness. This episode resembled ones he had experienced before and eventually led to his decision to undergo aortic valve replacement. Fecal and urinary incontinence (option B) and chest pain (option E) occurred, but were not the trigger for his decision. Option A discusses postprandial syncope, which is a condition that causes people to faint after eating but this wasn't listed as the persuasive factor. Option D is incorrect because, while the cardiologist likely suggested the operation, it was not the triggering incident."
94,3,12001650,What is the patient's medical history and what were the diagnoses for this patient's subsequent hospital visits?,Patient had a history of hypertension and subsequent hospital visits resulted in a diagnosis of heart disease.,"Patient's history indicated cholecystitis s/p lap cholecystectomy c/b choledocholithiasis requiring ERCP and diagnoses from subsequent visits were choledocholithiasis, complicated diverticulitis, and acute diverticulitis.",Patient had a history of epilepsy and subsequent hospital visits diagnosed the patient with migraine.,The patient's history reflects anemia and subsequent visits deduced a lung infection.,Patient's medical history showed a diabetes diagnosis and subsequent hospital visits were linked to kidney disease.,B,"Based on the notes provided, the patient's past medical history highlights cholecystitis s/p lap cholecystectomy c/b choledocholithiasis, and ERCP. In their subsequent hospital visits, they were diagnosed with choledocholithiasis, complicated diverticulitis, and acute diverticulitis. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect as those conditions are not mentioned anywhere in the patient's history or in the diagnoses from the subsequent hospital visits."
95,3,19330126,What changes in the patient's treatment and condition were observed between the 2153-11-16 and the 2157-05-26?,The patient's kidney care was monitored by ultrasound and they underwent a number of high-dose IL-2 therapies.,The patient underwent surgery to remove the renal cell carcinoma and went on a trial drug to manage condition.,The patient was briefly put on Sutent therapy and then switched to high-dose IL-2 therapies for his kidney cancer.,The patient was discharged with regular medications post a high-dose IL-2 therapy during both visits.,"The patient was put on Sutent, and showed a response to therapy for pulmonary hilar, adrenal, and renal lesions and later, due to the deteriorating clinical status, was made comfort measures only (CMO).",E,"The patient's treatment between the specified dates was initially with IL-2 therapy (noted in the 2153-11-16 note), which was then changed to Sutent with noted response in pulmonary hilar, adrenal, and renal lesions,  as per the 2157-05-26 note. Due to poor health, the patient was made CMO and died. Hence, the correct answer is E. Options A, B and C are incorrect since the patient was not just limited to high-dose IL-2 or one-time surgery or only briefly on Sutnet and then moved to IL-2 but also included several rounds of different treatments. D is incorrect since the medicines at the time of discharges were different and the patient was not discharged during the last visit but made CMO and died."
96,3,11990786,Why was the patient in note dated 2189-03-04 experiencing urinary retention and what steps were taken to deal with this issue?,The patient's urinary retention was due to an adverse reaction to her ampicillin allergy and she was prescribed alternate antibiotics to address this issue.,The urinary retention was a result of the patient's hypothyroid condition and she was given thyroid hormone replacement medication to relieve this symptom.,The patient's lower back pain due to a bulging disc at L5-S1 led to urinary retention which was relieved when her constipation was addressed and her back pain was managed.,The urinary retention was caused by acute cholecystitis as shown in her CT scan and she underwent gallbladder removal surgery to solve this issue.,The patient had urinary retention due to her excessive anxiety levels and was provided psychological counselling to overcome this problem.,C,"According to the note dated 2189-03-04, the patient's urinary retention was likely due to her constipation, which is related to pain management and narcotics she was taking for back pain. Once her pain was alleviated and she was able to have a bowel movement, she could urinate normally. Option A is incorrect because there was no indication that the patient's urinary issue was due to an allergic reaction. Option B is incorrect, as her hypothyroidism might have influenced her overall health, but there was no direct link mentioned between her hypothyroidism and her urinary retention. Option D is incorrect because the CT scan did not reveal acute cholecystitis, and there was no mention of gallbladder removal surgery. Option E is wrong because the patient's anxiety was addressed but was not directly linked to the urinary issue."
97,3,13011914,What was the evolution of the patient’s medical conditions from her admission on 2175-12-02 to her discharge on 2177-08-21?,"The patient was initially admitted with back pain and underwent a laminectomy. Later, she was readmitted due to an infection from a wound drainage. The patient improved gradually and was discharged in a stable condition.","The patient was initially admitted with hip pain and underwent several surgeries. Since the pain persisted, she opted for a hip replacement surgery with subsequent rehabilitation.","The patient was admitted for heart issues and underwent a bypass surgery. Subsequently, she also received a hip replacement due to severe arthritis.",The patient initially had a kidney stone which was surgically removed. She was re-admitted later with heart complications and went through a bypass surgery.,"The patient was first admitted for a lung issue, underwent treatment and was discharged. She was readmitted due to a relapse of the lung issue.",A,"Option A is the correct answer. The patient arrived chronically suffering from back and leg pain and thus underwent laminectomies (a type of back surgery). She experienced some complications post-surgery such as vomiting, chest discomfort and drainage from her wound leading to a readmission. However, she gradually improved and was discharged in a stable condition. The other options don't match with the patient's history of illness progression as B discusses a hip replacement which was not mentioned, C and D have heart and kidney issues which were never a part of patient's medical condition, and E mentions a lung issue which is also irrelevant to patient's medical history."
98,3,17780747,What was the reason for the patient's readmission 3 days after his discharge involving the C3-6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery conducted on 2173-01-09?,The patient had a fever and signs of infection at the incision site.,The patient had severe knee pain due to end stage osteoarthritis.,The patient was unable to swallow his medications and had difficulty in consuming food orally.,The patient experienced a significant weight loss post-surgery.,The patient suffered from clots in veins (deep vein thrombosis).,C,"According to the discharge summary in note 2, the patient was readmitted due to the progression of his discomfort in swallowing overnight (dysphagia s/p ACDF), resulting in the inability to take the necessary medications and adequate oral intake. Option A, B, D, and E were wrong answers since these situations were not specified in the discharge summaries but they were mentioned as possible complications or conditions, making them good distractors."
99,3,13245132,What changes were made to the patient's anticoagulation management following the septoplasty and subsequent hospital visits?,The patient was shifted to a high-dose course of warfarin and continuous heparin.,The patient's anticoagulation treatment was terminated and replaced entirely with heparin for better control.,The patient's warfarin treatment was halted and substituted with a regimen of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin followed by warfarin and enoxaparin post operation.,The patient's coumadin was held during hospitalization and resumed upon discharge.,The patient was advised to stop all anticoagulants after the septoplasty to reduce the risk of bleeding.,C,"Following the patient's septoplasty, discussions were held with a hematologist about the patient's anticoagulation management. The hematologist recommended stopping the heparin bridge to therapeutic INR post-surgery, considering the daily risk of thrombosis as extremely low and high risk of bleeding post-ENT surgery. Instead, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, 5000 U tid, was suggested while the patient was in the hospital, with resumption of warfarin post-operation. After the surgery, the patient continued on warfarin and began subcutaneous heparin treatment. At discharge, the patient was switched to enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily and their outpatient warfarin 1 mg daily dose, emphasizing the correct option is C. Though options A, B, D and E consist of details from the notes, they don't accurately reflect the changes made to the patient's anticoagulation management after the septoplasty and the subsequent hospital visits."
100,3,13816626,What was detected in the head CT scan conducted on the patient during the admission on 2164-11-16?,An occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage was found.,The CT scan revealed a mass effect in the patient's brain.,The CT scan showed an absence of acute pathological conditions in the patient's brain.,Edema was detected in the patient's brain.,The head CT scan recorded a recent infarction.,C,"The correct answer is C, which states that no acute pathology was found in the patient's CT head scan. This is mentioned in note 1 where the medical record states, ""CT head showed no acute pathology."" Although the words are slightly rephrased, it maintains the same meaning. All other choices describe pathological conditions- intracranial hemorrhage (choice A), mass effect (choice B), edema (choice D), and recent infarction (choice E)- which were not detected in the patient's head CT scan, based on the medical record in note 1, making them incorrect but plausible distractors."
101,3,17821166,"What major surgical procedures has the patient undergone between his first admission in 2146 and his last in 2149, and how did these surgeries impact his condition?",He had a bilateral hernia open procedure and it led to a decrease in his general physical strength.,"The patient underwent a C3-6 laminectomy and fusion in 2149. This procedure stopped the progressive left arm weakness caused by cervical spondylitic myelopathy, but led to a wound infection which required further surgical treatment.","He had a minor prostate surgery which improved his condition for the short term, but did not cure his prostate cancer.","The patient had a surgery for hypertension management, leading to a balanced blood pressure.","He had a Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in 2146 for his prostate cancer, which removed the cancerous prostate and led to stable condition with well-controlled pain.",B,"Choices A, C, D, and E are all false because while the patient did undergo a bilateral hernia operation years ago (A), and a Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in the first admission in 2146 (E), these are not the major surgeries between 2146 and 2149 asked for in the question. The minor prostate surgery (C) is false because no such procedure was recorded between the given timeframe. There is also no recorded surgery for hypertension (D). The correct answer is B as the C3-6 laminectomy and fusion was executed to halt the worsening left arm weakness and stiffness caused by the cervical spondylitic myelopathy. However, this surgery led to surgical site infection which required additional surgical treatment."
102,3,19303298,What was the cause of the patient's symptoms in the third hospital visit and were there any new complications discovered during this admission?,The cause of the patient's symptoms were due to a small bowel obstruction and there were new complications related to the patient's Pregnancy.,The patient's symptoms were due to not being able to tolerate oral intake and there were new complications with urinary retention.,The symptoms were caused by gastrointestinal distress due to the ileostomy takedown and no new complications were found.,"The patient's symptoms were attributed to ""sluggish"" movement in the bowel and there were no new complications found.",The patient's symptoms were caused by a urinary tract infection and a new complication of asymptomatic bacteriuria was discovered.,D,"The patient's symptoms during the third hospital visit were caused by ""sluggish"" bowel movement, also known as ileus. According to the discharge summary in note 3, there were no new complications found during this admission. This makes option D correct. Option A is incorrect because the symptoms were not caused by a small bowel obstruction. Option B is incorrect because there isn't any mention of inability to tolerate oral intake or urinary retention in note 3. Option C is incorrect as the symptom was not due to gastrointestinal distress from the ileostomy takedown. Option E is incorrect because the symptoms were not caused by a urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria is not considered a complication."
103,3,16301058,"What was the reason for the patient's readmission approximately 6 weeks after the initial treatment of acute cholecystitis with antibiotics, and what was the eventual clinical management?",The patient was readmitted due to autoimmune hepatitis complications and the resulting clinical management was the continuation of azathioprine and prednisone.,The patient was readmitted due to choledocholithiasis and treatment involved ERCP and stone extraction.,The patient was readmitted because of ectopic pregnancy and the treatment involved emergency surgery.,The patient was readmitted due to acute cholecystitis and treatment involved laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy.,The patient was readmitted due to sudden weight loss and unexplained fatigue.,D,"The phrase “she underwent laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis” shows that the reason for the patient's readmission was acute cholecystitis, and the eventual clinical management involved a cholecystectomy. The other options are not correct because they mention different reasons for readmission which are not related to the patient's condition according to the discharge summaries. Choice A refers to the patient's autoimmune hepatitis but this was not the reason for her readmission. Choice B mentions choledocholithiasis which was treated during the patient's previous visit, not the cause of the recent readmission. Choices C and E are incorrect as the patient’s discharge summaries do not indicate ectopic pregnancy or sudden weight loss and fatigue."
104,3,13375458,What has been the progression of the antibiotic treatment for the patient's cellulitis since the sclerotherapy procedure on her right shin?,"The patient was initially prescribed cefazolin and probenecid, then switched to vancomycin, linezolid, cipro, and finally augmentin.","The patient was initially prescribed cefazolin and probenecid, then given vancomycin, which was discontinued due to an allergic reaction and replaced by linezolid and cipro. After discharge, the patient was switched to bactrim, which was discontinued due to side effects. The patient was then prescribed augmentin, which she continued to take until her next admission when she was prescribed linezolid again.","The patient was initially prescribed cefazolin and probenecid, followed by a series of trial-and-error prescriptions including vancomycin, bactrim, and augmentin.","The patient was initially prescribed cefazolin and probenecid, followed by a series of trial-and-error prescriptions including vancomycin, bactrim, and augmentin. ","The patient was given cefazolin and probenecid, but when she showed no improvement, she was tried on different antibiotics, including linezolid, cipro, bactrim, and augmentin.",B,"As per the provided notes, the patient was initially put on cefazolin and probenecid by her PCP. During her hospital stay, she was prescribed IV vancomycin but had an allergic reaction, causing it to be discontinued. It was replaced by linezolid and cipro. After her discharge, her insurance did not cover linezolid so her regimen was changed to bactrim, which she did not tolerate well. Her antibiotics was changed to augmentin but when augmentin didn't relieve her symptoms, she was put back on linezolid. The other options are incorrect because they miss one or more steps in the progression of her antibiotic treatment."
105,3,16905933,What surgical procedure did the patient undergo during the last hospitalization and what was the underlying condition that necessitated this operation?,The patient underwent a T12-L4 laminectomy due to an intradural tumor.,The patient underwent a laminectomy to treat lung cancer.,The patient underwent spine surgery to treat PTSD.,The patient underwent a neurosurgical operation to treat cauda equina sydrome.,The patient had neurosurgery to treat bilateral adrenal masses.,A,"The correct answer was determined by examining the third note from the last treatment session. The primary surgical procedure that the patient underwent was a T12-L4 laminectomy, which was performed to address an intradural tumor. Although the patient also has lung cancer and bilateral adrenal masses, neither of these conditions was the primary reason for the surgical procedure, making options B and E incorrect. PTSD, as stated in option C, is a psychological disorder and would not necessitate a surgical procedure such as a laminectomy. The cauda equina syndrome mentioned in option D was a symptom arising from the presence of the intradural tumor, but it was not the underlying condition that prompted the operation."
106,3,10551006,What is the history of the patient's immediate complaints related to urinary problems post-surgery for right renal mass seen in his follow-up visits?,The patient reported intense stomach aches and vomiting.,The patient experienced severe bleeding and post-surgical complications.,"The patient complained of hematuria, inability to void, and severe abdominal pain post-surgery.",The patient noted difficulty in breathing and lightheadedness.,The patient experienced allergic reactions to his medications post-surgery.,C,"The patient's post-surgery complaints, as mentioned in the provided notes, primarily revolve around urinary difficulties as evidenced by remarks about hematuria (blood in urine), severe abdominal pain, and an inability to void (urinate). The incorrect answer choices A, D, and E are incorrect because their contents (stomach aches with vomiting, difficulty in breathing and lightheadedness, and allergic reactions to medications, respectively) appear nowhere in the provided notes. While choice B mentions severe bleeding and post-surgical complications, it does not accurately reflect the focus on urinary problems referenced in the direct question."
107,3,14772770,What is the infectious agent that caused the patient's pyelonephritis and what antibiotic sensitivity were identified during her hospital stay charted on 2160-01-16?,"The patient had an infection caused by Hepatitis A, and was sensitive to Ertapenem.","The patient was infected by E.Coli, which was sensitive to Meropenem.",The patient had a chronic UTI caused by recurrent staghorn calculus and was sensitive to Vancomycin and Zocyn.,The infection was caused by right staghorn calculus and was sensitive to Oxycodone-Acetaminophen.,The infection was owing to a chronic UTI and the pathogen was sensitive to Macrobid.,B,"The discharge summary on 2160-01-16 (Note 2) explicitly mentions that the patient was treated for pyelonephritis, and the infectious agent was determined to be sensitive to Meropenem. Option B paraphrases this information correctly. Options A, C, D, and E are all wrong because they mention incorrect diagnosis and treatment details, even though these details are found elsewhere in the patient's medical notes, they are either irrelevant or incorrectly paired with the sensitivity information."
108,3,15025371,"What was the identified surgical complication of the patient after the left upper lobe wedge resection and upper lobectomy procedure described in the note charted on 2122-03-25, and how was it managed?",The patient developed symptomatic fibroid uterus that was managed with endometrial biopsy.,The patient had subcutaneous emphysema and a small apical pneumothorax that resolved after an extra day in the hospital and repeated chest x-rays.,"The patient developed a residual left apical pneumothorax, which was managed with intravenous fluids and electrolyte repletion.","Post-operatively, the patient developed left upper lobe cavitary lesion and was managed by maintaining a regular diet and staying hydrated.","The patient had a pulmonary complication that was managed by early ambulation, good pulmonary toilet, and incentive spirometry.",B,"The correct answer is option B. According to the discharge summary dated 2122-03-25, the patient did develop subcutaneous emphysema and a small apical pneumothorax after the left upper lobe wedge resection and upper lobectomy. These conditions were managed by keeping the patient an extra day in the hospital and performing repeated chest x-rays, evidenced by the statement, “subcutaneous emphysema was markedly worse after chest tube removed, so pt was kept another day, and follow-up chest x-ray prior to discharge showed stable apical pneumothorax and interval resolution of subcutaneous air.” The other options are incorrect, but are good distractors as they contain content from the discharge summary. However, these options don't correctly answer the doctor's question. Options A and C are incorrect because the patient didn't develop a symptomatic fibroid uterus or a residual left apical pneumothorax that was managed with fluids and electrolytes. Option D is incorrect because the left upper lobe cavitary lesion was the reason for the surgery, not a complication after the surgery. Option E is not a correct answer choice as it is a part of the standard postoperative management, not a specific response to a complication."
109,3,16094261,"Did the patient undergo endocrine supplement therapy after her thyroidectomy, and if so, did this result in any unexpected consequences?","The patient was prescribed calcium and vitamin D3 supplements three times daily, which caused severe hypercalcemia.",The patient was given a daily iron supplement that resulted in palpitations.,"The patient was instructed to take a multivitamin after thyroidectomy, leading to renal pain.","After her thyroidectomy, she took a daily dose of Levothyroxine Sodium, causing a decrease in her potassium levels.","The patient was prescribed Iron and Percocet immediately post thyroidectomy, leading to severe constipation.",A,"The correct answer is A. In note 3, it's detailed that the patient was taking a large dose of calcium and vitamin D3 supplements three times daily, as well as calcitriol. These endocrine supplements were prescribed after her thyroidectomy (note 2) and caused severe hypercalcemia, which is an unexpected and adverse outcome. B is incorrect because there is no indication in any note of the patient taking iron or experiencing palpitations. C is wrong because the multivitamin was not mentioned to cause any specific side effects. D is a distractor because, while the patient did take Levothyroxine Sodium, it's not indicated that this specifically caused the decrease in her potassium levels. Finally, E is incorrect as Iron and Percocet were not prescribed after her thyroidectomy."
110,3,16429356,"What was the probable cause of the patient's scrotal and penile swelling occurring after his right inguinal hernia repair, according to the tests and assessments done during his last hospital stay?",Left inguinal hernia repair with mesh,"Mild edema of the soft tissues, likely secondary to recent surgical procedure",Prostate cancer treated with external beam radiation,Diffuse calcified pleural plaques seen at the lung bases,Bowel wall thickening and adjacent stranding within the sigmoid colon,B,"The patient's swelling in the scrotal and penile areas occurred following a right inguinal hernia repair. A scrotal ultrasound was performed which reported mild edema of the soft tissues, likely related to the recent surgical procedure (from note 3). Option A is incorrect because the patient had a left inguinal hernia repair in the past but the current issue is related to a right inguinal hernia repair. Option C is incorrect because while the patient does have a history of prostate cancer, there is no direct link mentioned in the notes that connects it to the current swelling. Option D and E reference the patient's other medical conditions that were mentioned in the notes but are not linked to the post-surgical swelling."
111,3,13024230,What medical procedure was initiated after the identification of a saddle pulmonary embolus in the patient?,The patient was treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.,The patient was administered pantoprazole 40 mg.,The patient was started on a heparin drip and transitioned to Lovenox.,The patient underwent a laparoscopic cystectomy.,The patient was given aggressive fluid hydration for acute renal failure.,C,"The question asks for the specific medical procedure initiated after the diagnosis of a saddle pulmonary embolus. According to the information from note 3, once the saddle pulmonary embolus was identified, the patient was started on a heparin drip and transitioned to Lovenox. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Although options A, B, D, and E detail actions and medications given during the patient's hospital visit, they aren't specifically related to the identified pulmonary embolism as they deal with a UTI (A), an unspecified condition (B), a surgical procedure (D) and acute renal failure (E) respectively."
112,3,19353454,What was the patient's final diagnosis upon their last admission and what treatment was pursued for them?,The patient was diagnosed with two basal ganglia masses (brain masses) and underwent brain surgery to obtain tissue samples for further examination.,"The patient was admitted for fevers, chills, and was diagnosed with acute endometritis. Antibiotics were prescribed for treatment.",The patient was diagnosed with a shellfish allergy and was administered antihistamines.,The patient presented with a respiratory infection and was treated with oral antibiotics.,The patient was diagnosed with anemia and received a blood transfusion.,A,"The patient's final admission discussed in the notes indicates that she was diagnosed with basal ganglia masses or brain masses (Note 3). The patient underwent a surgical procedure to biopsied this lesion. Choices B represents prior admissions wherein she had had a different diagnosis. Choice C, D, and E are incorrect as they are not mentioned in the patient's history. Thus, A is the correct answer."
113,3,11088469,What procedures were done to address the patient's longstanding wound problem related to diverticular disease and multiple laparotomy procedures?,The patient underwent a sigmoid colectomy with a diverting ileostomy.,The patient was subjected to a ventral hernia repair with mesh twice.,The patient's wound was managed with a series of split-thickness skin grafts from the right thigh to abdomen.,The patient was treated for a diverticulitis flare-up.,The patient was put on medication for his non-insulin-dependent diabetes.,C,"The correct answer is C because the patient underwent a series of split-thickness skin grafts from the right thigh to the abdomen to manage his chronic wound problem, as indicated in both note 1 and note 2. Options A and B, while they are surgeries the patient underwent, they did not directly address the longstanding wound problem in question. Option D was an event in the patient's medical history, not a procedure done to address the wound problem. Option E is incorrect since it pertains to the patient's ongoing diabetes management, not his chronic wound problem."
114,3,16313269,What was the pathological diagnosis of the mass in the left temporal lobe after the initial biopsy performed in June 2164?,The mass was diagnosed as a glioblastoma.,The lesion was diagnosed as HTN.,The mass didn't show any specific pathological traits.,The diagnosis is unspecified as the biopsy had some complications.,"The mass was diagnosed as an infiltrating glioma, WHO grade 2, IDH 1 wild-type, diffuse astrocytoma.",E,"In the third note, the pathology from the patient's biopsy is directly stated to be an ""infiltrating glioma, WHO grade 2, IDH 1 wild-type, diffuse astrocytoma."" This clearly answers the question. The other options mention 'glioblastoma' (option A), which is incorrect as the tumor was not classified as such; HTN (option B) which is a medical abbreviation for hypertension, not a type of brain lesion. Option C and D are incorrect as the pathology was specified in the notes without any mention of complications in the biopsy."
115,3,12151869,What was the patient's treatment plan during her admission as per the note charted on 2176-07-12 and how does it compare with her previous treatment received during her previous hospital stay charted on 2175-03-17?,"The patient underwent an angiogram diagnostic process in 2176-07-12, as compared to her previous treatment of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on 2175-03-17.",The patient underwent an aortic stenosis diagnosis in 2176-07-12 which parallels her previous treatment of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on 2175-03-17.,"The patient underwent mitral regurgitation treatment in 2176-07-12, similar to her previous treatment of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on 2175-03-17.","The patient underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement treatment in 2176-07-12, just as her previous same procedure in 2175-03-17.",The patient faced a cerebrovascular disease examination in 2176-07-12 that contrasts with her previous treatment of right femoral patch angioplasty on 2175-03-17.,A,"The correct answer is A because on 2176-07-12, the patient was presented for an elective repair of infrarenal AAA involving an ultrasound-guided access to the left common femoral artery and the placement of a tube stent graft (note 2). During her stay on 2175-03-17, the patient underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis followed by a right femoral patch angioplasty (note 1). The two treatments target different conditions. The rest of the answer options are incorrect as they either improperly identify the procedures conducted during the visits or they wrongly associate similar treatments to the two different stays."
116,3,11863782,What was the patient's discharge disposition after his readmission due to inability to take care of himself at home and what set of medications was he given at the time of discharge?,The patient was discharged home with a prescription for oral antibiotics.,The patient was discharged to a rehab facility with a prescription for Docusate Sodium and Erythromycin.,The patient was discharged home with a prescription for Oxycodone and Amoxicillin.,"The patient was discharged to a rehab facility with prescriptions for Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Erythromycin, and Amoxicillin.",The patient was discharged to home with service and prescribed Docusate Sodium and Erythromycin.,D,"In note 3, it is outlined that the patient was discharged to a rehab facility following a readmission due to his inability to care for himself at home. The discharge medications listed include Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Erythromycin, and Amoxicillin. Options A, B, C and E are incorrect as they do not completely fulfill the circumstances. Option A indicates the wrong discharge location, while option B and E lack all prescribed medications. Option C lists incorrect discharge location and one incorrect medicine."
117,3,15207802,What is the primary diagnosis of the patient and what is the progression of his disease based on the provided 'discharge summaries'?,"The patient's primary diagnosis is Hyperlipidemia, which seems to be worsening as he is in the habit of not eating adequately.","The primary diagnosis of the patient is Hypertension, and the disease seems to be progressing with the patient experiencing intermittent tachycardia.","The patient has been diagnosed primarily with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), the progression of which appears severe as it has metastasized to the liver and cerebellum.","The patient mainly suffers from Glucose intolerance, which is progressing as he has started experiencing weakness.","The patient's primary diagnosis is Anemia, and the disease seems to be in a critical stage as per his decreased Hematocrit level.",C,"The patient's primary diagnosis as mentioned multiple times in the discharge summaries is Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. It is noted from the summaries that this disease progressed significantly over time. Initially, it was seen in the right upper lobe (note 1). This escalated to the metastasis to the brain and was confirmed by the MRI of the brain showing multiple lesions suggestive of metastases (note 2). Later scans showed additional metastases to the liver (note 3). Other answers like Hyperlipidemia, Hypertension, Glucose Intolerance, and Anemia are part of the patient's medical history, but they are not his primary disorder. Additionally, there isn't clear evidence of significant progression in these other diseases."
118,3,15559683,"What were the chronological surgical interventions performed for the patient's gallstone and choledocholithiasis conditions, and how did the patient respond to these?",The patient started off with medication followed by a minor procedure to remove stones and finished with surgical cholecystectomy and ERCP.,The first step was a laparoscopic cholecystectomy after which the symptoms subsided only to re-emerge leading to an ERCP.,"The patient received an ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement, followed by a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, removal of stents, and multiple stones from cystic duct and common bile duct.","The primary approach was exercising coupled with medication, after which a stent was inserted during ERCP.",The patient received only laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by medication to manage gallstones and choledocholithiasis.,C,"The discharge notes clearly state that the patient underwent an ERCP, with sphincterotomy and stent placement first, due to the choledocholithiasis condition and later, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed along with the removal of stents, and multiple stones from the cystic duct and common bile duct were excised during the second ERCP. Post-surgery, no recovery issues were reported by the patient. Answer choice A, B and D are misleading as it suggests that the patient started off with medication or minor procedure/exercise which is not true. Answer choice E is incorrect because it suggests that the patient only received a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, ignoring the ERCP and stent placement procedure which played a crucial role in the patient's treatment."
119,3,16165433,"What were the chronological treatments conducted on the patient's left knee and right knee, and what are the underlying conditions leading to these treatments?","The patient underwent a right knee arthroscopic medial meniscectomy due to severe pain, and later a left total knee replacement due to gout.","The patient first underwent the Elmslie-Trillat procedure on the left knee due to discomfort and pain, aggravated by tricompartmental osteoarthrosis, and later had a total knee replacement on the right knee due to full-thickness articular cartilage loss.",The patient had a total knee replacement for the left knee due to hypercholesterolemia and underwent a right knee arthroscopic medial meniscectomy due to hypertension.,"The patient initially had a left knee arthroscopic medial meniscectomy due to osteoarthrosis, and later underwent a right total knee replacement due to severe pain.",The patient first underwent a total knee replacement on the left knee due to persistent pain caused by tricompartmental osteoarthrosis and later underwent a right knee replacement due to full-thickness articular cartilage loss.,E,"The patient's treatment started with the Elmslie-Trillat procedure on the left knee. This treatment wasn't mentioned in the answer choices but the condition leading to it was tricompartmental osteoarthrosis. After a while due to worsening conditions and persistence of pain, the patient underwent a total left knee replacement. Later, a right total knee replacement was done on the patient because of full-thickness articular cartilage loss.  Option A is incorrect because the patient did not have gout or severe pain in the right knee. Option B, C, and D are incorrect as the Elmslie-Trillat procedure was conducted on the left knee and not the right. Also, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension did not lead to the knee treatments."
120,3,15957729,What was the patient's progression of diseases that contributed to repeat hospitalizations before her death?,The patient had multiple hospitalizations due to COPD exacerbation.,The patient had a recurrent medical issue with kidney stones.,"The patient was frequently hospitalized because of complications from peripheral arterial disease, COPD, Lung Cancer and intracranial bleed.",The patient had a history of regular hospital admissions due to chronic hypertension.,The primary cause of the patient's repeated hospitalizations was a known allergy to Bactrim and Atorvastatin.,C,"From the patient's notes, we can see that she was admitted and treated for peripheral arterial disease, which led to leg pain and resulted in several procedures, including angioplasty and stent placement. She was also diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which required regular medical attention and management. Later, a CT guided biopsy revealed the patient had invasive squamous cell carcinoma, also known as Lung cancer. This led to hospitalizations for monitoring and management of the disease. Following a fall, the patient was hospitalized once again and diagnosed with intracranial bleed. Thus, option C is the correct answer.  Option A is incorrect because COPD was only one of the conditions contributing to the patient's hospitalizations. Option B is incorrect because the patient's kidney stone issues are mentioned but aren't indicated as a cause of regular hospitalizations. Option D is incorrect because, although the patient had a history of hypertension, the condition does not appear to have directly led to the repeated admissions. Option E is incorrect as the known allergies to Bactrim and Atorvastatin are not reasons for her repeated hospitalizations."
121,3,17385332,Did the patient have any history of peripheral vascular disease prior to his visit on 2154-06-18 for worsening claudication in his right leg?,"The patient had no history of peripheral vascular disease, but had undergone treatment for a rectal polyp.","The patient had a history of peripheral vascular disease, which was treated with angioplasty and stent placement to right SFA.","A kidney cyst removal had been done previously, but there was no record of any history of peripheral vascular disease.",The patient did have a history of peripheral vascular disease but it was treated by a Laparoscopic Right Colectomy.,"The patient had a past history of colonic polyps, but no history of peripheral vascular disease was mentioned.",E,"The patient did not have any history of peripheral vascular disease recorded prior to his visit on 2154-06-18. Options A, B, C and D are incorrect - B and D wrongly claim previous treatments for peripheral vascular disease, while A and C rightly deny such history, they both wrongly relate different previous medical issues to it, when the question is strictly about peripheral vascular disease. E is correct, because it says there is no record of such history, and although it mentions colonic polyps, it does not confuse it with peripheral vascular disease as conditions A and C do."
122,3,19591974,What was the pertinent result from the patient's C-spine CT taken during the admission identified by the ID 24071410?,The patient had a flexed cervical posture and piltaeral frontal scalp pain.,"Left lung base opacity most likely represents atelectasis, but infection or aspiration should be considered.",The CT spinal scan did not show any acute fractures or traumatic malalignment.,The patient was diagnosed with severe neck pain and neck mobility issues.,The CT scan showed an unchanged position of bilateral deep brain stimulators.,C,"As mentioned in the question, the doctor asked about the results from the patient's C-spine CT scan taken during the admission with the ID 24071410. It's noted in the discharge summary under 'Pertinent Results' that the CT c-spine (cervical spine) did not show any acute fractures or traumatic malalignment (Option C), making it the correct answer.  While other options are taken from portions of the notes, they are distractors as they don't answer the question asked. Option A mentions symptoms the patient was experiencing but isn't a result of the CT scan. Option B discusses the observation from a CT of the chest, not the cervical spine. Option D outlines a diagnosis, not a CT scan result. Lastly, Option E mentions a finding from a different CT (of the head)."
123,3,15001834,"What was the range of time between the first documented hospital admission and the final documented hospital admission for this patient, and what was the cause for each admission?",The patient was admitted from 2195 to 2198 due to alcohol abuse and chest pain caused by alcohol.,The patient was admitted from 2195 to 2198 due to hepatitis C and substance abuse.,The patient was admitted from 2195 to 2200 due to alcohol intoxication and suspected pneumonia or aspiration.,The patient was admitted from 2198 to 2200 due to chest pain and history of alcohol abuse.,The patient was admitted from 2198 to 2200 due to hepatitis C and alcohol intoxication.,C,"The first documented hospital admission happened on 2195 and final documented admission happened on 2200, hence the time frame is from 2195 to 2200. The first admission note shows that the patient was mainly admitted due to alcohol abuse and chest pain. The final note describes the patient as being admitted after being found in a state of intoxication on a train, and concerns of pneumonia or aspiration due to intoxication. The other options, while they contain content from the notes, do not accurately represent the time frame or the primary reasons for admission in the first and last document."
124,3,16987398,"What were the main clinical indications for the patient's first exploratory laparotomy, intraoperative ultrasound, segmental resections of segment 7 and segment 2?",Treatment of end-stage liver disease,Treatment of heart complications,Due to a liver lesion concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma,To prevent ascites in the patient,Due to depression-based complications,C,"The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, intraoperative ultrasound, and segmental resections of segment 7 and segment 2 due to a liver lesion that raised concerns about hepatocellular carcinoma. A 2.3 cm lesion was found at the junction of segments 7 and 8 of the liver, and the patient was determined to be a good candidate for surgical excision due to the peripheral location of the lesion. Thus, option C is the correct answer as it accurately summarizes this information from the notes.   Option A is incorrect because while the individual did have end-stage liver disease, this is too broad of a reason to specify why these specific procedures were performed. Option B is incorrect because while the patient might have had heart complications, the notes don't indicate that they were the main clinical indications for these specific procedures. Option D is incorrect because the notes don't specify ascites prevention as the primary goal of these procedures. Option E is also incorrect because the notes do not suggest that his depression-based complications were the main clinical indications for these specific surgical procedures. Other pieces of information from the notes could have logically led to these distractors, making them reasonable, but still not the correct answer."
125,3,12500012,What two surgical procedures were performed on the patient during her second admission on chartdate 2144-08-18?,Past Medical History and Physical Exam.,Leg exam and pain management.,"Anterior/posterior lumbar fusion with instrumentation, L5-S1 and L4-5 decompression with PSIF.",Lumbar Discectomy and Physical Therapy.,Allergy tests and medication adjustment.,C,"During the second hospital admission on the date 2144-08-18, the patient underwent two surgical operations. The first operation was an anterior/posterior lumbar fusion with instrumentation at the L5-S1 level which was done through an anterior approach. The second operation was a L4-5 decompression with posterior spinal interbody fusion (PSIF), which was part of a staged two-part procedure.   Option A, B, D, and E are incorrect and are distractors. The procedures listed in these options, such as physical exam, leg exam, and pain management are not surgical operations. In the case of option D, while Lumbar Discectomy was a surgical operation, it was not performed on the specified date. Therefore, the only correct answer is option C."
126,3,17047840,What significant change was observed in the third hospital visit (dated 2143-10-21) as compared to the previous visits with regards to treatments provided for the patient's perianal abscess?,Surgery was performed to treat severe hemorrhoid conditions,The patient was kept NPO overnight with intravenous fluids and analgesics,Incision and drainage procedure was carried out under anesthesia,No surgical or invasive procedures were performed during this visit,"Underwent EUA, drainage of the abscess, and anal fistula treatment",D,"The third hospital visit was significantly different from the previous two because no surgical or invasive procedures were performed to address the patient's perianal abscess. This contrasts with the earlier visits, where the patient had invasive interventions such as an examination under anesthesia, incision, and drainage of the abscess, which is highlighted in option A, C and E. Option B was false because it was not mentioned in the third hospital visit's summary. Therefore, D is the correct answer."
127,3,11141115,"Did the patient have a history of tobacco use and if so, when the patient quit smoking?",The patient quit smoking a few years ago and maintained abstinence.,The patient never had a history of tobacco use.,The patient quit smoking after the diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinits.,The patient quit smoking along with his alcohol abuse.,The patient is still smoking along with his history of alcohol abuse.,A,"In Note 2 it is mentioned, ""H/O TOBACCO ABUSE quit ___, (ICD9-305.1)"", indicating the patient had a history of tobacco abuse and quit smoking. However, the specific date is not mentioned in the document. All other answer choices are incorrect. Option B is incorrect because there was definitely tobacco use in the patient's history. Option C is incorrect because there is no information linking smoking cessation to the diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinitis. Option D and E are incorrect because they wrongly associate smoking habits with alcohol abuse, which is not supported by the given notes."
128,3,12179332,"What is the patient's recent surgical history, specifically regarding complications and post-surgical complications?",The patient underwent only medication therapy for the pelvic abscess.,The patient experienced extensive post-operative ileus after a surgical procedure.,The patient underwent endovascular repair of left common iliac artery aneurysm with no reported complications.,The patient had a surgical procedure and post-surgical complications included UTI and wound infection.,The patient went through an invasive procedure for left iliac artery aneurysm that resulted in post-surgical complications of abscess and pneumonia.,C,"The patient had a sequence of surgical procedures - Drain Placement of Pelvic Abscess and Laparoscopic Low Anterior Resection for diverticulitis (note 1 and note 2) followed by endovascular repair of the left common iliac artery aneurysm (note 3). There were no post-surgical complications reported for the endovascular surgery which is the most recent one. Option A is incorrect as the patient did undergo surgical procedures. Option B is incorrect because the patient didn't experience extensive post-operative ileus. Option D and E are also incorrect as the patient didn't experience any post-surgical complications including UTI, wound infection, pneumonia, or abscess."
129,3,13285598,What was the final diagnosis and treatment plan for the patient's pelvic mass?,The patient was diagnosed with a Bartholin cyst and was prescribed percocet as needed to control her pain.,The patient was diagnosed with an adnexal mass and the treatment plan involved undergoing a Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.,"The patient was diagnosed with a colon disorder, and she was provided with a statin for treatment.","The patient was diagnosed with a soft, palpable mass on the right side of the abdomen with no significant tenderness, and no treatment plan was recommended.",The patient was diagnosed with a mild LLQ tenderness on right side extending beyond midline of abdomen and was classified as a case of depression.,B,"The discharge summary notes clearly indicate that the patient was diagnosed with a pelvic mass (specifically an adnexal mass) and underwent a Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for treatment. Although other options A, C, D, and E mention some issues noted in the discharge summary, they are either not related to the final diagnosis of the pelvic mass or don't mention the correct treatment plan, making them incorrect but viable distractors."
130,3,13711459,"What surgical procedures has the patient undergone to manage her right axillary sarcoma, and what were the outcomes and subsequent hospital course of these surgeries?",The patient underwent wide excision right axillary sarcoma with successful recovery and no complications.,The patient underwent a right shoulder arthroscopy to treat her right axillary sarcoma.,The patient was treated with radiation therapy for her right axillary sarcoma.,The patient had a hysterectomy to treat right axillary sarcoma.,The patient underwent excision of scar and right split Latissimus dorsi flap procedure.,E,"The patient underwent a wide excision right axillary sarcoma (from note 1), but she later faced complications like recurrent fever and right axilla cellulitis (from note 2), which required further intervention. The other interventions she went through for right axillary sarcoma management is excision of scar and right split Latissimus dorsi flap (from note 3). The outcomes and subsequent hospital course of the interventions have been stable so far per the notes. Option A is incorrect because though the wide excision right axillary sarcoma was done during the initial treatment, complications arose which resulted in further action. Option B is incorrect because right shoulder arthroscopy is not related to the right axillary sarcoma. Option C is incorrect because radiation therapy was done for her breast cancer not axillary sarcoma. Option D is incorrect because a hysterectomy wouldn't have been performed to address a sarcoma in the axillary region."
131,3,11552479,What surgeries has the patient undergone and what is their chronological order?,"Right reverse total shoulder replacement, pituitary tumor transsphenoidal resection, lumbar laminectomy with L4-L5 fusion.","Transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumor, C4-6 Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion, right shoulder total replacement.","Lumbar laminectomy with L4-L5 fusion, C4-6 Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion, and right reverse total shoulder replacement.","C4-6 Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion, right reverse total shoulder replacement, transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumor.","Transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumor, lumbar laminectomy with L4-L5 fusion, C4-6 Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion.",C,"In Note 1, the patient was mentioned to have already undergone a lumbar laminectomy with fusion of L4 and L5. Later in Note 2, we see that the patient underwent an Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion on vertebrae C4-6. Finally, in Note 3, the record mentions a reverse total replacement of the right shoulder. Answer A to D are incorrect as they list surgeries in wrong order. Option E sequenced wrong surgeries as per the chronological order."
132,3,11728286,"What developed in the patient while under care, and what medical procedure was performed to address these developments during the patient's last hospital admission?",The patient developed neck tenderness along the shunt tubing and then underwent a subocciptal craniectomy for removal of meningioma.,The patient developed a severe headache and was treated with right parieto-occipital craniotomy for resection of parasagital meningioma.,The patient experienced swelling around the face and eyes and had a right frontal approach VP shunt surgery placed.,The patient developed fever and was treated with docusate sodium and Famotidine.,The patient had progressive hearing loss for which laser ear surgery was performed.,A,"The patient developed a meningioma, and a suboccipital craniectomy was performed to remove it. This was clearly indicated in the last note. Although other answer choices mention medical conditions that the patient has experienced, these are not developments that occurred under care during the last hospital stay. Further, answer choices B and C are incorrect because those procedures did not take place during the most recent admission. Answer choices D and E are also incorrect because the given treatments did not address a developed medical condition during the last hospital stay."
133,3,15111020,What was the first surgical procedure the patient underwent and why?,The patient underwent a greenlight vaporization of the prostate due to bladder cancer.,The patient underwent a Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) due to symptoms of bladder CA.,The patient underwent radiation treatment due to symptoms of generalized pain.,The patient underwent an open procedure due to gross hematuria.,Patient underwent ten TURBT procedures due to recurrent high grade transitional cell carcinoma.,A,"The notes provided in the discharge summary describe the first surgical procedure that the patient underwent as a greenlight vaporization of the prostate. This procedure was performed in response to the patient's lower urinary tract symptoms as a result of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) (option A). Options B, C, D, and E are procedures the patient underwent at a later point, this is evident from the wording and sequencing of the notes. Option B refers to a surgery conducted due to bladder cancer, while option C refers to radiation treatment for generalized pain, option D refers to an open procedure due to gross hematuria and option E refers to a series of TURBT procedures for recurring high grade transitional cell carcinoma. However, these did not occur before the greenlight vaporization of the prostate. Hence, they are incorrect but plausible distractors as they are based on information from the patient's medical history present in the discharge summary."
134,3,12514791,"What were the different causes considered for the patient's recurrent chest pain, and what was ultimately determined to be the most likely explanation for it? ","Multiple causes, including heart murmur and pulmonary embolism were considered, with the final diagnosis being pneumonia.","Several causes including heart attack and pneumothorax were considered, with the final diagnosis being sever colitis.","Potential causes like myocardial infarction and aortic dissection were considered, but the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of Atypical chest pain.","Several possible causes including acute coronary syndrome and gastritis were considered, and the patient was ultimately diagnosed with an inflammation of the stomach.","A range of causes including ischemia, pulmonary embolism, and peptic ulcer disease were examined, but it was determined that the patient's chest pain was most likely due to anxiety and stress.",C,"The chest pain was recurrent in nature as per the courses of treatment, with the patient consistently being ruled out for myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection. Though the patients had other symptoms like anxiety and stress, they were independent of the chest pain which was diagnosed as atypical chest pain as per note 2. Options A, B, D, and E refer to other conditions and symptoms the patient experienced but they were not related to the chest pain."
135,3,13638569,What was the timeline and series of procedures and interventions performed to address the patient's malignancy and pleural effusion?,"The patient underwent initial diagnosis and a right lobe biopsy, followed by two pleurodesis procedures and placement of a pleurex catheter, all over a three-month period.","The patient was diagnosed with malignancy, underwent a left lobe biopsy before a pleurodesis procedure three months later, and then home care was prescribed.","Initially, the patient was diagnosed and then thoracentesis and bronchoscopy were conducted, followed by chemotherapy after a month and subsequently a pleurodesis procedure.","The patient was first given medication treatments following the diagnosis, underwent pleural effusion drainage after a month, followed by a lung transplant surgery.","Following the diagnosis, the patient underwent a pleurodesis procedure and home care for two months, followed by another pleurodesis procedure and then diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.",A,"The discharge notes clearly indicate that the patient was diagnosed with malignancy and pleural effusion whereupon she underwent a right lobe biopsy and pleurodesis (note 1). Over the following month, she had increasing shortness of breath (SOB), underwent thoracentesis and bronchoscopy (note 2), and was admitted again for SOB and had a pleurex catheter placed (note 3). Option A is therefore the correct response. Options B, C, D, E do not accurately reflect the timeline and procedures given in the notes."
136,3,19911969,What was the cause of the patient's abdominal pain during her second admission and how was it treated?,"The patient’s abdominal pain was caused by a colon polyp, and it was treated with a laparoscopic right colectomy.",The abdominal pain was a symptom of vaso-vagal episodes experienced by the patient and it was treated with a 1L bolus.,"The patient’s abdominal pain was due to an episode of syncope, and it was treated by stopping her toradol and giving her 1u PRBC.","The patient's abdominal pain was caused by viral gastroenteritis which was likely triggered by Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and it was treated with a 14-day course of metronidazole 500mg.","The abdominal pain was due to Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis, and it was evaluated with a right upper quadrant ultrasound.",D,"In the second admission, the discharge summary indicates that the patient was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis likely triggered by an infection with C. diff, causing her abdominal pain. The hospital started the patient on a 14-day course of metronidazole for the treatment of this condition, thus making option D the correct answer.  Option A is incorrect, although the patient had a colon polyp, that was from her first admission, not the second one. Similarly, option C is incorrect as the symptoms described were from her first admission rather than the second. As for option B, the vaso-vagal episodes are identified in the discharge summary of the first admission. Even though the patient had experienced an episode of syncope, the treatment described is for the respective syncope episode and not for abdominal pain. Option E is wrong because even though cholelithiasis was identified in the discharge summary, it was noted that there was no acute cholecystitis requiring management, and it does not correspond with the treatment stated in the question."
137,3,12784208,What is the consistent condition all throughout the patient's admissions that the healthcare team is concerned about and how was it managed in the last noted admission?,"The healthcare team has been concerned about the ongoing vaginal bleeding stemming from a potential uterine rupture, and the patient received surgical intervention during her most recent hospital admission.","The primary condition that the medical team has been worried about across all the patient's admissions is bacterial vaginitis. During the patient's last hospital stay, this condition was treated with antibacterial drugs.","The patient's recurring presence of mixed bacterial flora has been a constant concern during her hospital admissions. During the patient's recent admission, antibiotics were administered.","Throughout her multiple admissions, the healthcare team has been continuously worried about her chronic abruption. This was managed through surveillance and advisement for inpatient stay until delivery during her latest admission.",Chronic anemia has been a constant health problem observed by the healthcare team. The patient has been managed with iron supplements and dietary advice at her most recent hospital admission.,D,"Throughout the patient's admissions, her chronic abruption (also known as placental abruption) creates a constant concern for the healthcare team. On her final admission, medical advice was urged to remain in the hospital until delivery due to the high risk of stillbirth associated with chronic abruption (choice D). Choices (A), (B), and (C) present conditions or treatments that were noted in the patient's history, but they are not the consistent and primary concern across admissions. While chronic anemia (choice E) is mentioned in her health history, the medical team's primary concern across multiple admissions due to persistent vaginal bleeding is the chronic abruption. The other answer choices are valid distractors because they all contain factual information from the patient's medical history but do not directly answer the specific question."
138,3,19530160,What were the main presenting symptoms during the patient's first recorded hospital visit and what diagnoses were made at that time?,"The patient came with chief complaints of heavy vaginal bleeding and reactive symptoms of syncope, and was diagnosed with adenomyosis and menorrhagia.",The patient got admitted with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with adenomyosis and pelvic inflammatory disease.,The patient was presented in the hospital with the main symptoms of heavy vaginal bleeding and was diagnosed with diabetes and menorrhagia.,"The patient's first recorded hospital visit was due to menorrhagia, and she was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and obesity.",The main presenting symptom of the patient during her first admission was abdominal pain and she was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease and Type 2 Diabetes.,E,"The first note provided shows the patient was admitted with the chief complaint of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease and Type 2 diabetes. Although Choices B, C, and D contain information from the notes, they are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the first recorded hospital visit of the patient. Choice A refers to a later hospital visit."
139,3,17215628,"What was the cause of the patient's hypotension during his second admission, and what changes were made to his medication regimen to address this issue?","The patient's hypotension was exacerbated by acute renal failure, and his medication regimen was altered by continuing his warfarin at 2.5 mg.","A viral gastroenteritis causing hypovolemia was held responsible for the patient's hypotension, and his lisinopril was reduced to 2.5 mg during his stay. ","The reason for the patient's hypotension was unclear, but propanolol was added to his medication regimen.",The patient's hypotension was presumably induced by a DVT and lovenox was added to his medication regimen.,"Hematuria was identified as the cause of the patient's hypotension, and coumadin was discontinued from his treatment plan.",B,"B is correct because according to note 2, the patient's hypotension on his second admission was thought to result from hypovolemia following a viral gastroenteritis, and his blood pressure improved with IV fluids. His lisinopril was reduced to 2.5 mg at discharge to manage his prolonged episodes of hypotension and hypertension. Choice A is incorrect because, while acute renal failure and adjustments to warfarin are mentioned in the note, they aren't directly related to the hypotension. Choice C is false because note 2 states that propranolol was stopped, not added. Choice D is incorrect because DVT resulted in the patient's first admission, not the second. Finally, choice E is incorrect because the patient did have hematuria, but it was not reported as the cause of his hypotension."
140,3,12716409,What condition was causing the patient's initial headache and neck stiffness as per the report on the 2187-05-06?,G6PD deficiency.,Sickle cell trait.,Acute intracranial hemorrhage.,Viral meningitis.,Polycystic ovary syndrome.,D,"The notes from this date indicate that the patient presented with symptoms suggestive of meningitis, which included headache and neck stiffness. The lumbar puncture results were consistent with viral meningitis. The patient was given coverage against bacterial meningitis but it was discontinued after it was felt that the meningitis was viral in nature. Answer choices A, B, C, and E are incorrect as there is no information suggesting G6PD deficiency, sickle cell trait, acute intracranial hemorrhage, or polycystic ovary syndrome caused the initial headache and neck stiffness. However, given they appear in the discharge summary, they serve as plausible distractors."
141,3,12132123,"What were the surgical procedures performed on the patient across all admissions, and how did they contribute to the resolution of the patient's condition?",The patient underwent two cholecystitis treatments.,The patient underwent a surgical biopsy on the left groin.,The patient underwent non-surgical management of Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"The patient underwent an ERCP, cholecystectomy, and another ERCP.",The patient underwent a port-a-cath placement.,D,"The information available in the discharge summaries indicates that the patient underwent an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) during the first admission to manage his abdominal pain and manage his cholecystitis. During the second admission, he underwent a Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy as a follow-up treatment, and another ERCP during the third admission for abdominal pain and fever. This sequence of procedures contributed to managing his condition and resuming regular activities, as indicated in the discharge notes. The other options are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because the patient underwent two ERCP procedures and one cholecystectomy - not two cholecystitis treatments. Option B is incorrect as the biopsy was a part of the patient's past surgical history, not a procedure carried out during these admissions. Option C is incorrect as the patient underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, not a surgical procedure. Option E is incorrect because port-a-cath placement belonged to the patient's past surgical history, not a procedure conducted during these admissions."
142,3,12010671,What was the presenting chief complaint of the patient at the most recent admission and what treatment was the patient prescribed upon discharge?,Chief complaint: Right foot deformity. Treatment: Bedrest and non-weight bearing on the right leg with medication for pain control.,"Chief complaint: L Foot Pain, Wound Eval. Treatment: A 10-day course of Bactrim for cellulitis and home pain regimen.",Chief complaint: Post-traumatic arthritis of the left ankle. Treatment: Bedrest and non-weight bearing on the left leg with strict medication compliance for pain control.,Chief complaint: Multiple fractures of both lower extremities. Treatment: Bedrest with strict medication compliance for pain control.,"Chief complaint: Obesity, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment: Continuation of ongoing medication and dietary regimen.",B,"The patient's most recent admission's chief complaint was L Foot Pain and Wound Eval as per note 3. The prescribed treatment was the completion of a 10-day course of Bactrim for cellulitis and continuation of the home pain regimen.   Choice A was incorrect because it refers to an earlier admission (note 2) and not the most recent one (note 3). Choice C was not correct as it was referring to the procedure that the patient underwent and not the presenting chief complaint at the most recent admission (note 3). Choice D was incorrect because it refers to the patient's past surgical history, not the chief complaint at the most recent admission. Choice E refers to the patient's past medical history and not the chief complaint of the recent admission."
143,3,17705074,What was the reason behind the patient needing a splenectomy as per the notes charted on 2146-08-12 and 2146-08-20?,The patient was experiencing severe inflammation due to his ___ Disease.,The patient needed a splenectomy related to a persistent pancytopenia condition.,The patient's splenomegaly was causing anemia.,The patient developed complications due to his Hepatitis B.,The patient needed a splenectomy due to a heart disease.,B,"Based on the provided discharge notes, option ""B"" is the correct answer. The patient had a persistent pancytopenia (low cell counts for red and white blood cells and platelets) and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) condition. Even though his anemia (low red blood cell count) and pancytopenia didn't respond to the discontinuation of the 6-mercaptopurine treatment, there was still no clear explanation for the splenomegaly. Consequently, the patient was referred for a splenectomy. Option ""A"" is incorrect because the patient's ___ Disease was not cited as the reason for a splenectomy. Options ""C"" and ""D"" are both wrong because the patient's anemia and Hepatitis B were not the reasons for a splenectomy. Finally, option ""E"" is incorrect, as there was no mention of any heart-related conditions in the notes."
144,3,13365246,What was the cause of the patient's recurrent episodes of vaginal bleeding in her early pregnancy and what was the patient's management plan?,The patient experienced recurrent episodes of vaginal bleeding because of hepatitis B; she was advised to take ferrous sulfate daily.,The patient's recurrent vaginal bleeding was due to overuse of prenatal vitamins; she was asked to reduce her vitamin intake.,The patient had recurrent vaginal bleeding due to a prolapsing mass within the cervix; she underwent a procedure to ligate this mass.,The patient was experiencing recurrent vaginal bleeding due to an allergic reaction to aspirin; she was advised to stop using aspirin.,The patient's bleeding was the result of a surgical error during a jaw surgery; the management plan involved rest and home care.,C,"The discharge summary from [note 1 end] and [note 2 start] reveal that the patient's recurrent vaginal bleeding was largely due to a prolapsing mass found in the cervix. And as a management plan, she underwent a procedure to ligate the mass. Option A is not correct as hepatitis B does not directly cause vaginal bleeding. Although prenatal vitamins were part of the patient's management plan (option B), they were not the cause of her bleeding. The aspirin allergy (option D) is not related to her bleeding, and the jaw surgery (option E) is a past surgical history unrelated to her pregnancy or vaginal bleeding."
145,3,11003999,What is the patient's significant past medical history related to her abdominal discomfort and the interventions undertaken in this regard?,"The patient's abdominal discomfort was caused by a mixture of chronic gastritis, H. pylori infection, and a uterine adenomyoma. The patient was treated for her H. Pylori infection and had a CT Enterogram performed.",The patient had been experiencing hypertension prior to her abdominal discomfort and underwent low-dose beta-blocker administration for treatment.,The patient's abdominal discomfort was due to endometriosis and she later underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral endometrioma drainage procedure.,"The patient had a history of heart problems, including fitful heart rhythm.",The symptoms of the patient's abdominal discomfort was an allergic reaction to shellfish.,A,"The patient's past medical history indicates a recurring abdominal pain that was most likely due to chronic gastritis, H. pylori infection, and a uterine adenomyoma all of which are related to her abdominal discomfort. Additionally, different interventions were undertaken including the treatment of the H. Pylori infection and a CT Enterogram.   Option B is incorrect because although the patient had hypertension, it was not directly related to her abdominal discomfort. Option C is incorrect as the surgical procedures occurred due to a complex set of conditions related to the patient's reproductive system (fibroids, endometriosis) and not directly linked to her described abdominal discomfort. Option D is incorrect as there is no mention of the patient having any cardiac conditions. Option E is not correct because the notes mention the patient's allergies, they are not identified as the cause of her abdominal discomfort."
146,3,16701330,What were the two main symptoms the patient experienced post chemotherapy?,Migraines and heightened blood pressure,Dizziness and nausea,Severe vision disturbances and vomiting,Frequent chest pains and insomnia,Tissue inflammation and infection,A,"Based on the provided notes, the patient experienced severe headaches described as ""worst headaches of her life"" and also had an increased blood pressure, indicating symptoms of migraines and hypertension respectively, post chemotherapy ([note 3]). Although the patient experienced some chest pain (option D), it was intermittent and not mentioned as being one of the main symptoms experienced post chemotherapy. Options B and C are incorrect as they do not align with the patient's main symptoms after chemotherapy and option E is stated nowhere in the notes provided."
147,3,11768516,"What is the patient's history related to his previous medical issues, and what treatment was prescribed following the admission on 2133-06-12?","The patient has a history of hepatic steatosis and heart palpitations. Following the admission on 2133-06-12, he was given medication to control heart palpitations and advised to continue home medications.","The patient has a history of anxiety and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Following the admission on 2133-06-12, he underwent liposuction for gynecomastia and his diet was advanced when he tolerated oral intake well.","The patient has a history of anxiety and inverted nipples. After being admitted on 2133-06-12, he underwent a procedure to correct his inverted nipples, and he was prescribed post-operative pain medication.","The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and anxiety. After being admitted on 2133-06-12, he underwent a DC cardioversion to restore the normal sinus rhythm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5 mg twice a day for a minimum of 1 month.","The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and anxiety. Following the admission on 2133-06-12, the patient underwent surgery for gynecomastia and was prescribed pain medication as required.",D,"In the notes from 2133-06-12, it's mentioned that the patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and anxiety. Following the admission, the patient underwent a DC cardioversion to treat the atrial fibrillation, and was prescribed Eliquis 5 mg twice a day for a minimum of 1 month. While option A, B, C, and E are incorrect because they mix elements from different admissions or deduce inaccurate prescriptions."
148,3,17788947,Was the patient prescribed anticoagulants or blood thinning medications after the ankle surgery as per the provided discharge summaries?,The patient was given antibiotics post-operatively.,The patient was given Acetaminophen for pain relief after the surgery.,"Enoxaparin, an anticoagulant, was included as a part of the patient's discharge medications.",Oxycodone was prescribed to the patient for pain management.,"The patient was discharged with a prescription for Colace, a stool softener.",C,"From the first note, we find that Enoxaparin, an anticoagulant, was prescribed as a part of the patient's discharge medications, making option C the correct answer. Although options A, B, D, and E refer to other types of medications given to the patient post-operatively, they are not related to anticoagulants or blood thinning medications and therefore represent incorrect answers. It is important to note that antibiotics (Option A) do not have blood-thinning properties, Acetaminophen (Option B) is pain relief medication not a blood thinner, Oxycodone (Option D) is a narcotic used to relieve moderate to severe pain, and Colace (Option E) is a stool softener rather than a blood-thinning medication."
149,3,15772088,What was the reason for the patient's second hospitalization following her elective surgery on her right frontal cavernous malformation?,The patient was hospitalized because of a mild stroke that occurred during her recovery period.,The patient was hospitalized for observation overnight due to a generalized seizure.,The patient was hospitalized following severe headaches and pain in the operation area.,The patient was hospitalized due to a failed operation and required additional surgery.,The patient was hospitalized because of an infection at the surgical incision site.,B,"Note 3 provides evidence that the patient was admitted for a second time due to a generalized seizure which occurred after her elective surgery (resection of right frontal cavernous malformation).  Option A is incorrect - there is no mention of the patient experiencing a stroke in the recovery period post-surgery.  Option C doesn’t align with the data. Though the patient reported some instances of a slight headache and incisional pain (note 2), they were not the reason for the second hospitalization.  Option D is not correct, there was no additional surgery required due to a failed operation in the notes. Option E is also false - there were no evidence or mention of an infection at the surgical incision site as the cause for the second admission in the hospital. These distractors are related to common post-operative complications and thus serve as good distractors."
150,3,17198737,What were the outcomes of the patient's past pregnancies and any complications encountered?,The patient has never been pregnant and thus has not experienced any pregnancy complications.,The patient's first pregnancy resulted in a healthy live birth and experienced no complications.,"The patient's first pregnancy ended in an intrauterine fetal demise due to severe pre-eclampsia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, and a large vaginal hematoma required surgical intervention.","The patient suffered from maternal health issues, including severe anemia and gestational diabetes, during her past pregnancies.",The patient's second pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage.,C,"The patient’s first pregnancy ended due to severe pre-eclampsia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and intrauterine fetal demise, as mentioned in note 2. Additionally, she developed a large vaginal hematoma that required surgical evacuation. Option A is incorrect because the patient has a history of pregnancies. Option B is also incorrect because the patient's first pregnancy did not end in a healthy live birth but rather complications emerged. Option D is incorrect because the patient did not suffer from severe anemia or gestational diabetes in her past pregnancies, according to the discharge summaries. Option E is incorrect because there is no mention of a miscarriage during the patient's second pregnancy; in fact, the term birth was stated in note 2."
