1,1,15455707,"What was the patient's condition like at the time of discharge, particularly focused on his vital signs, pain management and mobility?",The patient was responding well to the oral pain medications and was capable of consistent motion at the PIP of index fingers,The patient was on a repetitive intake of IV fluids and still appeared disoriented and unsteady,"Patient was experiencing altered states of consciousness, still in distress due to pain, and not able to ambulate","The patient was fairly stabilized, with pain under control, consuming a regular diet, and able to walk and relieve himself without assistance",Patient still required high-dependency care with heart rate and blood pressure under constant monitoring,D,"At the time of discharge, the patient exhibited stabilized vital signs, ate regular food, could walk and urinate unassisted, and had his pain well-managed, as mentioned in the discharge summary. Option A is incorrect as the patient couldn't demonstrate any active motion at the PIP of either index finger. Option B is a distractor that presents an early post-operative condition and not the state at discharge. Option C is incorrect as it contradicts the patient's state during discharge - the discharge summary states that the patient was alert, pain was well-controlled, and the patient able to walk independently. Option E is incorrect because the text does not mention the constant monitoring of vital signs at the time of discharge."
2,1,11801858,"What procedure was performed on the patient in response to her presenting STEMI/CAD, and what was the subsequent immediate outcome?","The patient underwent revascularization surgery, which led to an improvement in oxygen level.","The patient was treated with cardiac catheterization and had a BMS successfully deployed leading to restored blood flow, but later suffered from respiratory complications and passed away.",Patient took part in a heart transplant procedure that improved heart function.,The patient received a pacemaker that stabilized her heart rhythm.,"She underwent a coronary artery bypass graft, with signs of steady recovery after the procedure.",B,"The discharge summary states that the patient underwent cardiac catheterization in response to the STEMI/CAD. A BMS (bare-metal stent) was successfully deployed with good restoration of flow. However, the patient suffered respiratory complications and eventually passed away. Answer choice A is incorrect because there was no mention of revascularization surgery. Option C is misleading as there was no mention of a heart transplant. Option D is incorrect because the patient did not receive a pacemaker. Choice E is inaccurate as there's no information about a coronary artery bypass graft being carried out."
3,1,15648022,What intervention was performed in relation to the right paraclinoid ICA aneurysm discovered in the patient and what was the patient's condition at the time of discharge?,The patient underwent pipeline embolization for their right paraclinoid ICA aneurysm and was discharged in a disoriented state.,The patient underwent pipeline embolization for their right paraclinoid ICA aneurysm and was discharged in a clear and coherent state.,The patient did not require surgery for their right paraclinoid ICA aneurysm and was discharged in a clear and coherent state.,The patient underwent a brain biopsy for their right paraclinoid ICA aneurysm and was discharged in an alert and interactive state.,The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy for their right paraclinoid ICA aneurysm and was discharged in a clear and coherent state.,B,"The patient underwent a ""pipeline embolization of right paraclinoid ICA aneurysm"" as stated in the discharge summary. His mental status at the time of discharge was described as clear and coherent. Therefore this is the correct answer. While option A mentions the correct procedure, it is incorrect because the patient was not discharged in a disoriented state. Options C, D and E are incorrect because the surgical procedures refer to carotid endarterectomy or brain biopsy, neither of which is mentioned in the notes as having been performed on the patient for the right paraclinoid ICA aneurysm."
4,1,16645907,What reason was stated in the patient's discharge summary for not removing the stone from the bile duct during their ERCP procedure?,The stone was too large to be removed safely.,The patient developed cholangitis during the procedure.,The patient suffered from a medical complication involving a drastic decrease in oxygen saturation and required intubation.,They were waiting for the patient's elevated LFTs to normalize before removing the stone.,The stone was deeply lodged in the duct and could not be extracted.,C,"The correct answer is C. During the ERCP procedure, the patient experienced desaturation (a decrease in blood oxygen levels) and thus, required intubation for respiratory support. It can be deduced that due to this medical event and the patient's active cholangitis, the procedure had to be shortened, thus the stone was not removed during this procedure. The other options are incorrect but serve as good distractors because they are based on information within the discharge summary. For instance, the patient indeed had cholangitis (Option B), however, it was not the direct reason for not removing the stone. Some distractors are speculative such as the size or lodged position of the stone or normalizing LFTs before removal, which are not mentioned in the summary as the reasons for not performing the stone extraction."
5,1,19763858,"What was the probable diagnosis for the elevated liver function tests seen in the patient, and what was the eventual trend of these tests during the hospital stay?",Mild right renal caliectasis led to the elevated LFTs; these tests showed increasing values across the hospital stay.,Gallbladder abnormalities led to the elevated LFTs; these tests showed steady numbers across the hospital stay.,Preeclampsia was diagnosed by the elevated LFTs; these tests showed an erratic trend across the hospital stay.,Elevated transaminases associated with a viral illness led to the elevated LFTs; these tests showed a downward trend across the hospital stay.,Hepatitis caused the elevated LFTs; these tests showed stable numbers across the hospital stay.,D,"The discharge summary states that the patient had elevated transaminases from a probable viral illness, which was the cause of the elevated LFTs (“Hepatology… felt that her nausea/vomiting from a viral illness was the likely etiology of her transaminitis""). The LFTs trended downward during the hospital stay (“LFTs continued to trend downward”). While some options like A and B refer to findings from the ultrasound, they are unrelated to the LFTs. C is incorrect because the patient showed no evidence of preeclampsia/HELLP, and E is wrong because hepatitis was not mentioned as a diagnosis."
6,1,19505750,What were the patient's presenting symptoms and final diagnosis during the hospitalization?,The patient was admitted due to a cough and shortness of breath and diagnosed with pneumonia.,The patient was admitted for confusion and difficulty breathing which was diagnosed as a COPD exacerbation.,"The patient was admitted due to increased confusion and was diagnosed with a complicated urinary tract infection, dementia, and COPD.",The patient was admitted due to increased confusion and was diagnosed with dementia only.,The patient was admitted due to an urinal tract infection and was diagnosed with COPD.,C,"The patient arrived at the hospital with increased confusion (from the 'Chief Complaint' section), and had difficulty breathing (from the 'History of Present Illness' section). The final diagnoses provided in the 'Discharge Diagnosis' section are a complicated urinary tract infection, dementia and COPD. Option A wrongly attributes the reason for admission as a cough and shortness of breath, and includes an incorrect diagnosis of pneumonia. Option B incorrectly states that the final diagnosis was a COPD exacerbation, when in fact, the COPD is a pre-existing condition. Option D excludes the urinary tract infection and COPD from the final diagnosis, making it incorrect. Option E is incorrect because the initial symptom was confusion, not a urinary tract infection."
7,1,19501268,"What medication was the patient prescribed after the operation for her right knee arthritis, and how do these differ from her pre-admission medications?","The patient was prescribed Losartan Potassium, Hydrochlorothiazide, Metoprolol Succinate XL, and Aspirin, which are the same as her pre-admission medications.","The patient was prescribed Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Gabapentin, OxyCODONE, Pantoprazole, Senna, Aspirin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Losartan Potassium, Metoprolol Succinate XL. Also, the dosage of Aspirin was increased post-operation.","The patient was prescribed cortisone injections, which was a part of her earlier treatment strategy for pain management.",The patient was prescribed Aspirin 81 mg twice daily for DVT prophylaxis as the only new medication post-operation.,No new medicines were prescribed after the operation; the patient continued with her pre-admission medications.,B,"The patient's pre-admission medications were: Losartan Potassium, Hydrochlorothiazide, Metoprolol Succinate XL, and Aspirin. The post-operative medications included all of these, and additional medicines - Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Gabapentin, OxyCODONE, Pantoprazole, Senna. Also, the patient was put on Aspirin 81 mg twice daily after surgery, as compared to 81 mg once daily pre-admission. The distractors A, C, D, and E are incorrect but plausible if not carefully read the discharge summary. Option A repeats the pre-admission medication as the post-operative prescription; C refers to cortisone injections mentioned in the patient's history, but not in her post-operative medication; D only mentions one new drug, Aspirin for DVT prophylaxis and misses other new medications; and E incorrectly states no change in the patient's medication post-operation."
8,1,14650228,Did the patient have any prior history of liver related issues before the current admission related to abnormal liver functioning?,The patient had a previous diagnosis of cholelithiasis prior to the current admission.,The patient's past medical history includes transaminitis caused by liver problems.,"The patient had previously been diagnosed with hepatitis, which is a liver disease.",The patient did not have any previously diagnosed liver disorders before the current admission regarding abnormal liver functioning.,The patient's liver problems were discovered during a past surgical procedure.,D,"The patient's past medical history only includes a hemmorhoidectomy and a deviated septum repair (as mentioned under 'past medical history'), none of which indicate a past liver condition. The liver conditions mentioned occurred at the time of the current admission (e.g. transaminitis and hepatitis). The distractors are incorrect: Option A is wrong because while cholelithiasis is a factor in the current admission, it's not in his past medical history; B is incorrect as the transaminitis occurred during the current admission; option C is wrong as the diagnosis of hepatitis took place during the current admission, not prior; and E is incorrect as there's no record of the patient's liver issues being discovered during a past surgical procedure."
9,1,16723233,What was the patient's physical examination results and laboratory test results before his discharge?,The patient showed signs of high blood pressure and high WBC count during physical exam and laboratory test.,"The patient's vital signs were stable, along with benign abdominal examination with no cardiac or respiratory distress. Lab tests showed mildly elevated WBC but normalized eventually, along with a normal lipase level.",The patient exhibited signs of hypothermia and elevated triglycerides level.,Blood work showed extremely high levels of glucose and urea nitrogen.,"The patient's physical exam showed signs of abdominal pain, while lab results showed high levels of creatinine.",B,"Prior to discharge, the physical examination showed the patient has stable vital signs with no signs of distress or anomalies (Choice B). Laboratory results eventually normalized showing mild elevations which made it consistent with the physical exam. Answer choices A, C, D, and E although contextualized within the references of the patient's conditions and/or medical history, are however incorrect as they do not correspond to the last examination and laboratory results prior to discharge."
10,1,18430136,"What was the cause of the patient's shoulder pain and weakness, as noted in the discharge summary charted on 2134-11-17?",The patient suffered from a minor trauma,The patient had a severe case of stiff neck,The patient was diagnosed with Parsonage Turner syndrome,The weakness was due to over-exertion of the shoulder muscle,The patient suffered from urinary or bowel incontinence,C,"According to the discharge summary, the patient's shoulder pain and weakness were most consistent with ""Parsonage Turner syndrome,"" which is a condition characterized by sudden onset of severe pain in the shoulder and arm, often involving nerve damage leading to temporary or permanent disability. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect. There were no signs of trauma (A), and while the patient complained of a stiff neck (B), this was not the direct source of her shoulder weakness. Over-exertion of the shoulder muscle was ruled out as the patient denied any recent overuse of the shoulder (D). Finally, there is no evidence to suggest urinary or bowel incontinence contributed to her shoulder weakness (E). Although these options do appear in the discharge summary, they are not directly related to the cause of the patient's shoulder pain and weakness."
11,1,11616031,"What was the reason for the patient's recurrent shortness of breath over the months prior to admission, as per the note charted on 2155-07-05?",Chronic gastrointestinal issues related to Crohn's disease,Recurring pulmonary emboli and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Multiple episodes of acute abdominal pain,General old age and frailty,A history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation,B,"The note states that the patient had been experiencing shortness of breath for several months prior to admission. It mentions conditions that could cause this, including pulmonary emboli (PE) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A shows a disconnect as Crohn's disease primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract. While it has systemic symptoms, it's not directly related to breathing problems. C is incorrect as the recurring episodes of abdominal pain are not directly linked to the symptoms of breathlessness. D is not supported by the patient's clinical data. E is incorrect because, while atrial fibrillation and heart failure can cause shortness of breath, the patient's condition was primarily driven by the PE and COPD, making it misleading."
12,1,10312832,What was the primary neurological procedure performed on the patient's last hospital admission and what was the reason for this procedure?,The main procedure was a thyroidectomy due to Parkinson's disease.,Bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS- Stage 1 operation was carried out due to her severe cramping during off-states of Parkinson's disease.,Left foot surgery was conducted because of her Parkinson's disease.,The patient had a hysterectomy because she was suffering from severe cramping in the off state.,The primary neurological procedure was neuropathy due to her Parkinson's disease.,B,"The discharge summary mentions under the section 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure', the patient had a Bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS- Stage 1 operation. The reason provided for this procedure was the severe cramping she was facing during her off states of Parkinson's disease. Choice A is incorrect as thyroidectomy was mentioned under past medical history and not related to Parkinson's disease. Choice C and D are incorrect because she had foot surgery and hysterectomy in the past, not during this admission, and these are not directly linked to the management of Parkinson's disease. Choice E is wrong as neuropathy was listed under past medical history. It is a condition, not a surgical procedure."
13,1,18233849,What is the advice given to the patient regarding weight bearing activity post-operation?,The patient should stay immobile in bed for recovery.,The patient should avoid weight bearing on the left leg.,The patient can undertake weight bearing activities as tolerated.,The patient should remain non weight bearing on the right leg.,The patient is encouraged to start running to enhance recovery.,D,"The correct answer is D. In the discharge instructions regarding activity and weight bearing, the patient is advised to remain non weight bearing on the right leg. All the other options are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because the patient is not advised to remain completely immobile. Option B is incorrect because there is no mention of avoiding weight bearing on the left leg in the notes. Option C is incorrect as the patient is not advised to undertake weight bearing as tolerated. Option E is also incorrect because there is no mention of starting running in the provided discharge summary."
14,1,16294174,What procedure did the patient undergo during his hospital stay and what were the identified complications associated with his condition?,"The patient underwent a Roux en Y, revision gastrectomy and experienced complications of recurring gastric ulcers.",The patient had cardiac surgery; complications included unstable blood pressure and severe anemia.,"The patient underwent a Colonoscopy, facing complications such as unusual heart rate and interruption of the procedure due to bradycardic symptoms.",The patient underwent Esophagealgastrodudenoscopy (EGD) with high-grade dysplasia identified as a complication.,"The patient had a revision gastrectomy and a Roux on Y procedure, the complications linked were upper GI bleeding and high-grade dysplasia of the stomach- probable invasive cancer.",E,"The patient's discharge summary clearly indicates that he underwent a Roux en Y and a revision gastrectomy. The significant complications documented were upper gastrointestinal bleeding and high-grade dysplasia of the stomach, with further testing for invasive cancer pending. Other options, A and D mention part of the procedures but fail to encompass all details, and complications mentioned aren't accurate as per the notes. Option B incorrectly identified the patient's surgery to be cardiac and Option C mistakenly refers to an attempted but incomplete colonoscopy as the main procedure, while actual surgical procedures were entirely different."
15,1,11642966,What medications was the patient prescribed upon discharge?,IV Ceftriaxone and Augmentin,Tdap and Cetirizine,"Cetirizine, Augmentin, and Prenatal Vitamins","Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid, Tdap, and Cetirizine","Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid, Cetirizine, and Prenatal Vitamins",E,"Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed three medications: Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid, Cetirizine, and Prenatal Vitamins, as stated in the discharge summary's 'Discharge Medications' section. Choice A is wrong because she was given a dose of IV Ceftriaxone during her stay in the hospital, but it was not part of her discharge medications. She will only continue Augmentin (part of her discharge meds) for five days. Tdap appeared in the 'Past Medical History' section and not part of the discharge meds, making choices B and D incorrect. Meanwhile, Augmentin was wrong to include in choice C as it was replaced by Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid in the discharge medication."
16,1,14474450,"What was the patient's CD4 count at the time of discharge, and did it affect his HIV treatment regimen?",The patient's CD4 count was more than 500 at the time of discharge and completely changed his HIV treatment regimen.,"The patient's CD4 count was 160 at the time of discharge, but his HIV treatment regimen remained unchanged.","The patient's CD4 count was less than 200 at the time of discharge, changing his HIV treatment significantly.",The patient's CD4 count was 160 at the time of discharge and changed his HIV medication from nevirapine to lamivudine.,The patient's CD4 count was more than 500 at the time of discharge and he stopped the HIV treatment regimen due to recovery.,B,"The discharge summary states explicitly that the patient's CD4 count was 160 at the time of discharge, and his current HIV treatment regimen of nevirapine and lamivudine remained the same.   Option A is incorrect because the CD4 count was not over 500 at the time of discharge and there was no change in his HIV treatment plan. Option C is wrong because the patient's CD4 count was not less than 200. Option D thinks his treatment changed from nevirapine to lamivudine which is wrong. His treatment included both before and after discharge. Lastly, option E is incorrect because the patient's CD4 count was not over 500 at the time of discharge and the patient did not stop his HIV treatment."
17,1,10445921,What is the possible cause of the intermittent atypical chest pain that the patient experienced and what tests have been conducted to confirm this?,"The cause of the intermittent atypical chest pain may be attributed to a blocked artery, and a blood test to measure cardiac enzymes was done to confirm this.",The cause of the intermittent atypical chest pain could be linked to GERD. This was confirmed using an endoscopy procedure.,The cause of the intermittent atypical chest pain may be traced back to multiple sclerosis. An MRI was carried out to confirm this.,"The cause of the intermittent atypical chest pain is likely costochondritis, confirmed by palpation and a nuclear stress test.","The cause of the intermittent atypical chest pain may be related to dyslipidemia, and a lipid profile test was carried out for verification.",D,"Medical reports indicate that the patient's intermittent atypical chest pain is most probably due to costochondritis. Palpation and a nuclear stress test were performed for diagnostic purposes, which rendered normal myocardial perfusion, therefore ruling out ischemic causes. Although the patient has a history of GERD and dyslipidemia (Options B and E), the report specified that her current symptoms do not feel like GERD, and dyslipidemia usually does not present with chest pain. Regarding option A, while cardiac enzymes were indeed elevated and concerned physicians, further tests showed no abnormalities, ruling out blocked arteries. And lastly, even though the patient has multiple sclerosis (Option C), it does not typically result in chest pain."
18,1,10946481,What were the major surgical or invasive procedures the patient underwent during the hospital stay according to the discharge summary dated 2140-04-06?,Underwent appendectomy and gallbladder removal,"Performed angiograms near the spleen and arteries, embolized a distal splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, and placed a tube in the left chest",Received treatment with IV antibiotics for sepsis,Administered a blood transfusion to treat anemia,Completed a corrective surgery for a broken rib,B,"The discharge summary provides evidence that the patient had angiograms carried out on the celiac and splenic arteries, embolization of a distal splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, as well as the placement of a left chest tube. Hence, option B is correct. Other options such as A, C, D and E, although they talk about possible interventions a patient may go through, are not documented in this discharge summary, making them incorrect answers for our question. However, they serve as good distractors because they could be potential procedures that patients hospitalized for trauma such as this patient might undergo."
19,1,16994616,What was the patient's past surgical history prior to her total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy?,The patient had no past surgical history.,"The patient had past surgeries for hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and thromboembolic disease.",The patient's past surgical history includes the removal of wisdom teeth.,The patient's surgical history involves the placement of a Mirena IUD.,"The patient had undergone surgeries for the treatment of her depression, generalized anxiety disorder, migraines, and tinnitus.",C,"The correct answer is C. The patient's past surgical history prior to her total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy includes the removal of wisdom teeth as evidenced by PSH (Past Surgical History) mentioned in the discharge summary. Answer A is incorrect since it was clearly mentioned that the patient had surgery for the removal of wisdom teeth. Answer B is incorrect because these are diseases the patient denies having, not surgeries she went through. The placement of the Mirena IUD mentioned in option D doesn't necessarily involve surgery and is part of her gynecological history, not her surgical history. Answer E is incorrect since these are part of her past medical history, not surgical history, and there is no mention of surgeries for these conditions."
20,1,16683202,What were the identified microbes in the patient's wound culture during her hospital stay?,Gram negative bacteria were identified.,No microorganisms were found.,Gram positive cocci were detected minimally.,Different types of microorganisms were identified.,The culture result showed abundant growth of aerobic bacteria.,C,"The discharge summary states that the patient's wound culture revealed 'rare growth of gram positive cocci'. So, the correct answer is C: Gram positive cocci were detected minimally. The other options are incorrect: A: The report did not mention any gram-negative bacteria in the wound culture. B: The microbiology report states that there were microorganisms seen, contradicting choice B. D: Only one type of microorganism was mentioned to be found, so it is incorrect. E: There was a rare growth of bacteria, which contradicts 'abundant growth'. Moreover, whether it was aerobic or anaerobic was not specified in the summary."
21,1,11666484,What was the cause of the patient's right subtrochanteric stress fracture?,The patient has a history of osteoporosis.,The patient overexerted herself while pulling up a sock.,The patient had a negative reaction to her allergy to Codeine.,The patient developed the fracture due to the medication phosphomax.,The patient sustained the fracture during her septoplasty procedure.,D,"According to the discharge summary, the patient's right subtrochanteric stress fracture was caused by phosphomax. Option A, while factually correct, was not identified as the direct cause in this case. Options B and C are incorrect because the trigger incident (pulling up her sock) was not identified as the cause and her allergy to Codeine is irrelevant to the fracture. Option E is also invalid as the septoplasty procedure was not related to her fracture."
22,1,12028432,What was the patient's presenting complaint and how was it managed in the course of the hospital stay?,"The patient was suffering from hyperlipidemia and asthma which were managed with azithromycin, atovaquone, and doxycycline.","The patient presented with weakness, fevers, and was found to have babesiosis which was managed with azithromycin, atovaquone, and doxycycline.",The patient had a strawberry allergy and was treated with atorvastatin.,The patient was found to have anemia and was treated with Tylenol.,The patient suffered from hyperlipidemia and was managed with azithromycin and atovaquone.,B,"Based on the discharge summary, the patient initially presented with weakness and fevers, and during the course of his hospital stay, was diagnosed with babesiosis. This infection was managed with antibiotics including azithromycin, atovaquone, and doxycycline (confirmed in the 'Brief Hospital Course' and 'Discharge Medications' sections). The other options are incorrect as they refer to different aspects of the patient's condition or treatment that are valid aspects of the patient's overall stay but not related to the primary presenting complaint or its management."
23,1,11082839,"What is the antiplatelet medication that the patient has been discharged with after the stroke, and what is the goal for the patient's INR?",The patient has been discharged with Coumadin and the goal for the patient's INR is not specified.,The patient has been discharged with Acetaminophen and the goal for the patient's INR is not specified.,"The patient remains on a Heparin drip to manage blood thinning, and the goal for the patient's INR is not stated.","The patient has been discharged with warfarin (Coumadin), and the target for INR is unlisted.",The patient has been discharged with Methylphenidate and the goal for the patient's INR is not specified.,D,"The patient was discharged with Warfarin (brand name: Coumadin) as indicated in the ""Discharge Medications"" section of the document. This is the only antiplatelet medication listed there. The target for INR is not explicitly mentioned in the document making D the correct answer. The other medications are found under ""Discharge Medications"" as well, but these are not antiplatelet medications, therby making them incorrect. Although the patient did initially receive a heparin drip, this was stopped during the hospitalization which negates option C."
24,1,17250896,What was the reason for the patient's admission to the hospital and what treatment was she provided during her stay?,The patient was admitted to the hospital because of her dementia and she was given a heparin gtt during her stay.,"The patient was admitted to the hospital due to a blood clot in her right leg, and she was treated with ACE wrap, leg elevation, and anticoagulation by switching from heparin gtt to Apixaban 10mg BID.",The patient was admitted to the hospital because she had Parkinson's disease and her treatment included apixaban 10mg BID.,"The patient was admitted to the hospital due to decreased mobility at her group home, and the main treatment was physical therapy.","The patient was admitted to the hospital for surgery, and she was given heparin gtt, ACE wrap RLE with elevation.",B,"The patient's admission to the hospital was due to an extensive right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (RLE DVT) (Option A and D are incorrect because they cited the wrong reasons for hospital admission). As per the note, during her stay, her treatment included an ACE wrap, leg elevation, and anticoagulation therapy, which was switched from heparin gtt to Apixaban 10mg BID (Option B); it was not mentioned that she underwent surgery (Option E) nor was she treated for Parkinson's disease specifically during her stay (Option C). Thus, option B is the correct answer."
25,1,13248120,"What was the operation performed on the patient prior to admission due to post-operative bleeding, and how was it treated in the hospital?",The patient underwent a colonoscopy and the post-operation bleeding was treated with blood transfusion.,The patient underwent a sphincterotomy and the post-operation bleeding was controlled with stitches and cauterization.,The patient underwent a fistulotomy and the post-operation bleeding was treated with antibiotics.,The patient had removal of external hemorrhoids and the post-operation bleeding was handled with direct pressure.,The patient underwent surgery for an anal fissure and the post-operation bleeding was controlled through blood clotting medications.,B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient has a history of posterior anal fissure and external hemorrhoids and underwent a sphincterotomy (option B). The post-operative bleeding was controlled with the help of stitches and cauterization in the emergency department. Though options A, C, D, E do mention surgical procedures related to GI tract, they are not the exact operation the patient underwent. Also, the treatments suggested in options A, C, D, E do not align with what was done as per the discharge note. Hence, the correct answer is B."
26,1,19097438,What physical examinations were performed upon the patient's admission and what were their results?,The patient underwent visual acuity test which showed normal vision.,The patient had a liver test that depicted elevated liver enzymes.,"The patient had general examination, cardiovascular examination, pulmonary examination, abdomen examination, extremities examination, skin examination and neurological examination.",The patient's urine culture showed the presence of bacteria.,The patient had a chest x-ray that revealed normal results.,C,"As described in the discharge summary, the patient had a general examination where it was found that he was intubated and sedated. The cardiovascular examination showed regular rhythm and no murmurs/rubs/gallops. The pulmonary examination displayed an asymmetric chest wall with missing breath sounds on the left, coarse sounds with scattered end-expiratory wheezes on the right. The abdomen was soft and not distended with positive bowel sounds. The patient's extremities were warm and dry with palpable DP pulses assessed with doppler, and extensive bandages covered all four extremities. He had multiple areas of skin breakdown, friability, ecchymosis, and ulceration. Neurologically, he responded to painful stimuli. The other options (A, B, D, E) are incorrect as they either aren't mentioned or contradict the information in the discharge summary."
27,1,13780422,What was the chronological progression of the patient's symptoms and their corresponding management during the hospital stay?,"The patient had abdominal pain that lasted for eight days, diagnosed with norovirus mid-week, felt better but then worse, was seen at urgent care and referred for a CT scan that confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. During the hospital stay, she was given IV fluids, made NPO, administered ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, managed without pain medication, and discharged home with oral antibiotics.","The patient had abdominal pain and diarrhea, was diagnosed with appendicitis after an 11 mm appendix was found on CT scan, but surgery was not performed. Instead, she was treated with hydration, and discharge medications included ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.","The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and a leukocytosis of 17.4. She was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, monitored throughout the stay, and discharged with guidance to consume plenty of fluids and to resume all regular home medications.","The patient had abdominal pain for 8 days, initially diagnosed with norovirus, and later found to have an enlarged appendix on CT scan. While in the hospital, she was given IV fluids, made NPO, and treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Her symptoms improved steadily, her diet was adjusted as she got better, and she was eventually discharged with oral antibiotics.","The patient initially felt unwell with abdominal pain and norovirus. After urgent care, a CT scan was done, identifying an 11 mm appendix. She was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team, managed with fluids and started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Her condition improved over time and she was then discharged with oral antibiotics.",D,"This choice reflects the chronologic order of the patient's symptoms from initial abdominal pain of 8 days duration, waking from sleep with vague abdominal pain and other symptoms, feeling better, getting acutely worse, ending up with a CT scan showing an 11 mm appendix. Hospital management included IV fluids, NPO status, treatment with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Symptoms improved over time, being hungry, white cell count decreased to 5.9, advanced to a regular diet, and switched to oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Answer choice A is incorrect because it did not mention that she was made NPO or advanced to a regular diet during her hospital stay. Answer choice B is incorrect because it did not specify the nature of hydration received, also no mention of NPO status or switch to regular diet. Answer choice C is incorrect as there is no mention of the initial norovirus diagnosis or the NPO status and diet switch during the hospital stay. Answer choice E is incorrect because it did not describe the chronology of symptoms and the dietary changes that occurred during the hospital stay."
28,1,13318632,"What gastrointestinal conditions were identified in the patient during his admission, and what was the primary invasive procedure undertaken to address one of these conditions?","Conditions identified were Hypertension and GERD, and the patient underwent ERCP with catheter insertion for stone extraction.","The patient was diagnosed with Jaundice and GERD, and the invasive procedure conducted was ERCP with stent placement.","The patient had Choledocholithiasis with obstruction and GERD as the identified conditions, and ERCP with stone extraction was performed.","Conditions identified in the patient were Hypertension and Choledocholithiasis, and an invasive procedure of ERCP with stent placement was carried out.","The patient was diagnosed with Choledocholithiasis and Hypertension, and the procedure followed was ERCP with the catheter insertion.",C,"The patient's discharge diagnosis listed both Choledocholithiasis with obstruction and GERD as significant gastrointestinal conditions. As for the treatment, the discharge summary stated that an ERCP with stone extraction was performed. While other treatments and conditions were discussed, such as hypertension, these either did not relate directly to the gastrointestinal realm or was not the primary invasive procedure. For example, stent placement and catheter insertion relating to ERCP were parts of the process, but the primary invasive procedure was stone extraction."
29,1,11920993,What evidence supports the patient's diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism and what treatment was initiated?,"The patient reported hemoptysis and leg pain, and a CT scan confirmed fatty liver, after which he was started on Enoxaparin Sodium 100 mg and Warfarin 5 mg.","The patient showed symptoms of leg pain and swelling which led to the diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism, following which he was given a heparin drip for anticoagulation therapy.","The patient's left leg was swollen and a CTA showed a right lower lobe pulmonary embolus. This, along with hemoptysis and confirmation of a Deep Venous Thrombosis via a non-invasive study, confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was given a heparin drip and eventually discharged on Coumadin and Lovenox for further treatment.",The patient showed sings of Colonic Polyps which led to the diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism and was initiated on a therapy including aspirin 325 mg and Lisinopril 20 mg.,"The patient's glucose level was 90 and further tests indicated a heterogeneous left lobe of the thyroid leading to a diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism. The treatment involved administration of Vitamin D 50,000 UNIT PO DAILY.",C,"The diagnosis of the patient's Pulmonary Embolism was based on the variety of symptoms the patient presented and confirmed by diagnostic imaging (CTA showing a right lower lobe pulmonary embolus and a non-invasive study confirming a Deep Venous Thrombosis). The initiation of a heparin drip while in the hospital and the continuation of anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin and Lovenox after discharge verified the treatment. Other options are incorrect as they either involve incorrect diagnosis procedures (A, D and E) or they do not accurately describe the treatment/medication given to the patient (B)."
30,1,12252456,What reason for concern became evident during the initial patient's admission that required surgical intervention for further evaluation?,Patient was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor,There was a rupture of a complex right adnexal cyst in the patient's system,Patient was experiencing severe abdominal pain because of indigestion,Patient was diagnosed with a 12 cm complex left adnexal cyst,Patient was found to have high CA-125 levels indicating a probable abnormality,B,"The correct answer is ""B: There was a rupture of a complex right adnexal cyst in the patient's system"". This is evident in the discharge summary where it describes that the patient initially presented with increasing abdominal girth and then experienced severe pain. She was then evaluated and the test results indicated the rupture of a 12 cm complex right adnexal cyst, requiring surgical intervention. Option 'A' is incorrect as it relates to the patient's family history, not the immediate concern. 'C' is incorrect as there is no evidence of indigestion in the summary. 'D' is not correct as the summary explains that her left ovary appeared to be within normal limits. Lastly, 'E' is incorrect as the summary states that her CA-125 level is 31, which is within the normal range."
31,1,17400562,What changes in medication were implemented during the patient's stay in the hospital?,The patient's daily dose of Lisinopril was increased from 10 mg to 25 mg.,The patient was instructed to stop taking Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily.,The patient began taking Aspirin 81 mg and Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg twice daily.,The patient stopped taking his home prescriptions of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide and was only prescribed Metoprolol.,The patient was only prescribed Aspirin 81 mg upon discharge.,C,"The discharge summary states that during the course of the patient's stay, two new daily medications (Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg and Aspirin 81 mg) have been added to his treatment. Answer A is incorrect because there is no change in the daily dosage of Lisinopril from the admission to the discharge records. Answer B is incorrect because the patient still continues to use Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg upon discharge. Answer D is inaccurate because Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide continue to be part of the patient's daily medication even after discharge. Finally, answer E is wrong because the patient was not only prescribed Aspirin but also Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg."
32,1,15748482,"What was the reason for the patient's usage of Flomax post-operation, and what was the outcome?",Flomax was administered to help with patient's high blood pressure which was resolved on day 2.,"The patient was given Flomax to alleviate severe pain, and the patient reported reduced pain on the first postoperative day.","Flomax was administered due to the patient's urinary retention, and by the first postoperative day, the patient was voiding independently.","Flomax was used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and there was no evidence of DVT on ultrasound.","The patient was given Flomax to assist with the healing of the surgical incision, which appeared to be healing well on the second postoperative day.",C,"Flomax was given to the patient on the night of the operation due to over 500 mL volume in the bladder scan indicating urinary retention. As stated in the hospital course section of the discharge summary, the patient was voiding independently on the first postoperative day, which means the urinary retention was resolved.  Option A is incorrect as Flomax is not a medication used for controlling hypertension. For the high blood pressure, the patient was given a one-time dose of Hydralazine. Option B is also misleading because Flomax is not used for pain management. Pain management was addressed with a combination of IV and oral pain medications. In option D, it is suggested that Flomax was used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but it's incorrect as the medication used for DVT prophylaxis was Aspirin 325mg. Lastly, option E is incorrect. Although the patient’s surgical incision was healing well, it was not mentioned anywhere in the discharge summary that Flomax was used to assist with the healing of the surgical incision. Flomax is typically used to help with urinary issues, not wound healing."
33,1,16868140,"What procedure was performed on the patient for the mandibular fractures, and what was his recovery process post-operation?","The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation for his bilateral mandibular fractures, followed by resting in the medical ward till improvement in condition.",The patient underwent removal of braces due to the mandibular fractures and felt better after surgery and oral medications.,"The patient underwent a closed reduction of bilateral mandibular fractures, and post-surgery, he was able to tolerate a full liquid diet, ambulate independently and maintain his pain under control.",The patient was given amoxicillin for his mandibular fractures and then was kept under observation in the PACU.,The patient underwent Bilateral mandibular fracture repair and spent the rest of his recovery period in psychiatric counselling.,C,"The patient underwent a procedure called 'closed reduction of Bilateral mandibular fracture' as mentioned in the line, ""who performed a closed reduction of bilateral mandible fractures on ___"". His recovery process involved tolerating a full liquid diet, taking oral pain meds, passing gas, no excessive pain and being able to ambulate independently which can be confirmed from lines ""On POD1 he was tolerating a FLD, on oral pain meds, passing gas and in no excessive pain."" and ""The patient was tolerating a diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled."" Other options such as A, B, D, E are incorrect because the treatment and recovery process mentioned in them either did not occur or they did not contain the complete information about recovery process."
34,1,14084590,What is the likely cause of the patient's persistent throat pain and low-grade fever before her admission to the hospital?,The patient was suffering from osteoporosis.,The patient had taken a bisphosphonate without water and this got stuck causing irritation in her esophagus.,The patient was dealing with two small 4mm pulmonary nodules.,The low-grade fever could be attributed to muscle aches and other Upper Respiratory Infection symptoms.,The patient's low-grade fever was due to an abnormal mediastinal soft tissue mass.,B,"The medical report explicitly mentions bisphosphonate as the cause of the patient's throat pain. The patient took the pill without water causing a feeling of it being stuck in the throat and persistent pain. Regarding the low-grade fever, the notes did not directly connect the fever with the bisphosphonate pill, but the patient reported the onset of fever around the same time, with no other systemic symptoms observed, suggesting a viral infection. Answer A is incorrect because while the patient does have osteoporosis, it isn't likely the cause of her throat pain and fever. Answer C does not fit as the nodules were small and no connection with the fever or throat pain was made. Answer D and E are wrong because the patient denied any Upper Respiratory Infection symptoms and the mediastinal soft tissue mass mentioned in her report was not linked to her fever or throat pain."
35,1,16995639,"What was the initial and final diagnosis given from the patient's visit on June 8th, 2155, and what was her complaint upon admission?",Final diagnosis was an infection and the patient complained of fever and nausea.,"The patient was diagnosed with Lumbar radiculopathy, initial diagnosis suspected a potential epidural abcess and her complaint was about back and leg pain.",The patient complained about shellfish allergy on admission and was diagnosed with Asthma in the end.,Patient initially complained of chest pain and ended up being diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.,The final diagnosis was chronic lower back pain and her admission complaints were related to abdominal discomfort and diarrhea.,B,"Upon reading the discharge summary, the patient's chief complaint was back and leg pain. From that, a diagnosis was suspected as potential epidural abcess and after the examination confirmation was achieved for Lumbar radiculopathy diagnosis. The other options are incorrect, though they mention details found in the document like the patient's allergies (option C), indication of ESR/CRP elevations and fever (option A), but these details do not answer the specific question. Similarly, the chest pain (option D) and abdominal discomfort and diarrhea (option E) were not in the patient's admission complaint or the final diagnosis. Hence, the only correct answer is option B."
36,1,10043423,"What were the preliminary causes identified for the patient's presyncopal episode and chest discomfort, and what modifications were done to her medication?","Coronary artery disease was suspected, and the dose of hydrochlorothiazide was decelerated.","The presyncopal symptoms were linked to recurring nasal congestion, and the administration of Afrin was stopped.",The patient was diagnosed with post-viral pericarditis leading to positive troponin prompting an increase in her aspirin dose.,"The patient experienced discomfort due to endometriosis, so a modification was made in her pain relief medication.","The symptoms were believed to be a consequence of taking hydrochlorothiazide and a common cold, so the drug was reduced, and Afrin was discontinued.",E,"The patient's presyncopal episode and chest discomfort were thought to be primarily influenced by the patient's fatigue, viral illness, and use of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as indicated in the hospital course. As a result, the dose of HCTZ was decreased from 50mg to 25mg daily. Moreover, the patient was advised to stop using Afrin due to potential rebound congestion and consider substituting it with Flonase or nasal saline as she was experiencing nasal congestion. The other options reference conditions or modifications not directly related to the question - while options A and C mention potential causes (Coronary artery disease and post-viral pericarditis), they are not the main reasons identified, and only option C mentions a change in medication (increase in aspirin) which wasn't implemented. Similarly, options B and D only mention one cause each and have incorrect medication changes - Afrin was indeed stopped but not due to presyncope, and no changes were made in relation to endometriosis."
37,1,17476941,What is the procedure performed on the patient for his Chief Complaint of benign prostatic hyperplasia and bladder stone?,The patient underwent colon resection.,The patient underwent laser cystolitholapaxy and transurethral resection of the prostate.,The patient underwent a form of renal/bladder ultrasound.,The patient underwent invasive procedure for the treatment of cecal carcinoma.,The patient was given oral pain medications for his chief complaints.,B,"The correct answer is B because in the patient's discharge summary it's stated that the major surgical procedures performed were ""Laser cystolitholapaxy of bladder stone greater than 2.5 cm, transurethral resection of the prostate."" This corresponds to the question which inquires about the procedure performed for his chief complaints of benign prostatic hyperplasia and bladder stone. The incorrect options are statements derived from the report, however they do not answer the question. The colon resection (Option A), treatment for cecal carcinoma (Option D), and oral pain medications (Option E) do not pertain directly to the treatment of the chief complaints asked in the question. Furthermore, the renal/ bladder ultrasound (Option C) is a diagnostic procedure, not a treatment."
38,1,15620845,What were the bacteria cultured from the patient's wound post-debridement and what were the discharge medications prescribed?,"Staphylococcus epidermidis, ciprofloxacin and acetaminophen","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), oxycodone and Bactrim DS","Staphylococcus aureus coag + and pseudomonas aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin and Bactrim DS","E. coli, Bactrim DS and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen","Staphylococcus aureus coag -, ciprofloxacin and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen",C,"After debridement, the cultured bacteria from the patient's wound were Staphylococcus aureus coag + and pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is the reason why option C is correct. The patient was then prescribed ciprofloxacin and Bactrim DS for their discharge medications. Option A is incorrect as the bacteria mentioned there was not cultured from the wound. Similarly, option B only has one correct bacteria mentioned and the medications are not fully correct. Option D is incorrect because the bacteria and one of the medications indicated are not correct. Option E could confuse people since Staphylococcus aureus was indeed cultured from the wound, but the patient's case had coag +, not coag -. Also, oxycodone-acetaminophen was not one of the discharge medications related to the bacterial infection."
39,1,13496345,What was the medication regimen for the patient on discharge and what key instructions were given regarding their activity level and monitoring of their post-operative condition?,"The patient was prescribed Diazepam 1 mg PO Q12H, Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, and Heparin 5000 UNIT SC BID along with other medications. The patient was instructed to refrain from any strenuous activities until the next appointment and to monitor the incision for any signs of infection daily.",The patient was prescribed Atenolol 25mg daily and metformin 500mg QAM along with other medications. The patient was advised to continue engaging in strenuous physical activities and monitor symptoms daily.,"The patient was prescribed Diazepam 1 mg PO Q12H, Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, and Heparin 5000 UNIT SC BID along with other medications. The patient was told to avoid examining the incision site and continue with normal physical activities.","The patient was prescribed Atorvastatin 80mg QPM, Naproxen 500mg BID, and Aspirin 81mg daily along with other medications. The patient was advised to physically exert themselves after surgery and remain vigilant of infection symptoms.",The patient was prescribed Atenolol 25mg daily and metformin 500mg QAM along with other medications. The patient was told to abstain from physical exertion until the follow-up appointment and to ensure they monitor their incision daily for infection indicators.,A,"Answer choice A is correct because it accurately lists a sample of the patient's medications at discharge and gives proper instructions about avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous exercise, along with monitoring the incision. Answer choice B wrongly denotes the medications on admission as discharge medications and misguides the activity level recommendation by suggesting strenuous physical actions. Answer choice C incorrectly provides instruction to not examine the incision site, and answer choice D inaccurately suggests that the patient was advised to physically exert themselves after surgery. Choice E wrongly identifies the medications given on admission as those prescribed on discharge."
40,1,13257091,What is the patient's recent medical issue that required him to be admitted to the hospital?,The patient had a severe headache and some discomfort in his right hip.,The patient was diagnosed with a right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and a compression fracture at the L4 vertebra.,The patient was admitted due to high glucose levels and symptoms related to diabetes.,The patient came in for a major surgical procedure.,The hemorrhage was located at the posterior part of the brain.,B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient was admitted to the hospital with a right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and a compression fracture at the L4 vertebra, which indicates that option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because the patient had no headache. Option C is not correct because although the patient has a history of diabetes, it was not the reason for his recent hospital admission. Option D is incorrect as the discharge summary mentions specifically that there were no major surgical or invasive procedures. Option E incorrectly states the location of the hemorrhage, which was at the frontal part of the brain rather than the posterior."
41,1,16740649,What were the symptoms and complaints that the patient was experiencing prior to her surgery?,The patient was experiencing fibromyalgia and GERD.,"The patient was experiencing urinary incontinence, vaginal prolapse, vaginal dryness, and constipation.","The patient was experiencing hematuria, kidney stones, and pyelonephritis.",The patient was experiencing insomnia and hypercholesterolemia.,The patient was experiencing adverse reactions to drugs.,B,"The discharge note mentions symptoms of urinary incontinence, vaginal prolapse, vaginal dryness, and constipation. Thus, option B is the correct answer. Although options A, C, D and E mention conditions, these are either part of the patient's medical history or unrelated to the main complaints that led to the surgery. As for option A, the conditions are part of the past medical history but not complaints prior to the surgery. In option C, the patient expressly denies having these symptoms. In option D, these are unrelated to her major complaint, and in option E, the patient has no known allergies or adverse drug reactions. Hence, these options are incorrect but they are plausible distractors as they contain information mentioned in the provided discharge summary."
42,1,11604408,What allergies does the patient have and how were they managed during her surgical procedure for GIST tumor?,"The patient has latex, benzydamine, and nasocort allergies, which were managed by prescribing alternative medications for the patient during her surgical procedure.","The patient has an allergy to acetaminophen, docusate sodium and oxycodone, which were managed by avoiding these drugs during the surgical procedure.","The patient is allergic to aspirin, atorvastatin and chlorthalidone, which were managed by excluding these pharmaceuticals from the surgical preparation and post-surgery medications.","The patient's allergies include losartan potassium, metoprolol succinate and oxyCODONE, which were managed through the use of alternative drugs for the surgical procedure.",The patient has GIST allergy which was managed by performing a lap gastric wedge resection.,A,"In the discharge note, it is clearly stated that the patient is allergic to latex, benzydamine, and nasocort. Although it's not explicitly stated in the discharge summary how the allergies were managed during the surgical procedure, it's reasonable to assume any allergens would have been avoided in medication provision and procedural accommodations. The other options (B, C, D, and E) are incorrect because these substances are either given as medication to the patient or doesn't exist as allergen (Like GIST). Therefore, they can't be the allergens patient is allergic to."
43,1,12779687,What procedure was administered to manage the patient's diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary embolism and for how long should this medication be maintained?,The patient was given Atorvastatin and should continue the medication indefinitely.,The patient was kept on a diet plan and should follow this for six months.,The patient was put on an exercise regimen to be followed continuously for three months.,The patient was administered Apixaban and should maintain the dosage for a selected number of months.,The patient was given Aspirin following a strict dosage plan for three months.,D,"In the discharge summary, it is mentioned that the patient was administered Apixaban for managing bilateral pulmonary embolism. Also, it is indicated that the drug should be taken twice a day for a particular duration, however, the exact duration in months is left blank in the discharge summary for confidentiality.   Though Atorvastatin and Aspirin were part of the patient's medication regime (Choices A and E), they are incorrect because they were not used to manage the patient's bilateral Pulmonary Embolism. Choice B and C are also incorrect because no diet plan or exercise regimen is mentioned in the discharge summary for the management of the patient's condition."
44,1,18831426,What were the discharge medications prescribed to the patient during her admission due to abdominal pain and for what conditions were these medications prescribed?,"Acetaminophen for terminal ileitis, ciprofloxacin HCl for pancytopenia, and omeprazole for GERD.","Acetaminophen for pain relief, ciprofloxacin HCl and metronidazole for terminal ileitis, omeprazole for GERD, ondansetron for nausea, oxycodone for intense pain, and Gildess for hormonal regulation.","Ciprofloxacin HCl for GERD, metronidazole for terminal ileitis, and acetaminophen for nausea.","Ondansetron for terminal ileitis, oxycodone for pancytopenia, and Gildess for GERD.","Gildess for terminal ileitis, oxycodone for nausea, and omeprazole for pancytopenia.",B,"The discharge medications listed in the provided summary include acetaminophen for pain relief, ciprofloxacin HCl and metronidazole for terminal ileitis, omeprazole for GERD, ondansetron for nausea, oxycodone for intense pain not responsive to acetaminophen, and Gildess, a hormonal regulation drug. The choices A, C, D, and E provide false information about the reasons for prescribing certain medications. These options contain contents that appear in the discharge summary; however, they are incorrect answers, making them good distractors."
45,1,12302099,What was the treatment strategy used for managing this patient's chorioamnionitis and bacteremia during her hospital stay?,The patient was managed with anti-inflammatory medications and rest.,The patient was put on hydration and physical therapy.,"The patient was managed by IV fluids, IV antibiotics including ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin initially, then switched to IV penicillin, and she underwent a cesarean section.",The patient was treated with over the counter remedies and exercise.,The patient was managed with nutrition modification and blood transfusions.,C,"The discharge note clearly outlines that the patient was initially treated with IV fluids and a regimen of ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin for presumed chorioamnionitis upon admission. Later, she was switched to IV penicillin after cultures identified Group B streptococcus. As there was the risk of endocarditis, an echocardiogram was also conducted. Apart from the antibiotics, she also underwent a cesarean section due to the persistence of fetal tachycardia.  The other options are incorrect as they don't correctly represent the patient's treatment. Option A and D are incorrect as the patient was not managed solely with anti-inflammatory medication or over the counter remedies and she didn't require rest or exercises in this hospital stay due to the nature of her condition. Similarly, option B is incorrect as the patient's management involved more than just hydration and certainly did not include physical therapy. Option E is incorrect as there is no mention of nutrition modification or blood transfusions in the patient's treatment for chorioamnionitis and bacteremia."
46,1,19178866,"What was the patient's primary complaint during her hospital stay, and what potential condition was diagnosed upon discharge?","The patient was complaining about a severe headache, and was diagnosed with a possible migraine condition.","The patient was experiencing severe chest pain, and she was diagnosed with a potential cardiac concern.","The patient's chief complaint was abdomino-pelvic pain, and she was potentially diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy or a ruptured cyst.","The patient was suffering from nausea and vomiting, and was determined to be suffering from gastroenteritis.","The patient complained about abdominal bloating, and a potential gastric issue was diagnosed.",C,"According to the discharge notes, the patient's primary complaint was abdomino-pelvic pain. Upon discharge, a potential condition diagnosed was either an ectopic pregnancy or a ruptured cyst. The other options, while containing details from the patient's medical history or symptoms, were not her primary complaint or the condition diagnosed upon her discharge, and so they are incorrect, but can serve as distractors."
47,1,16455803,What was the primary injury and procedure used to treat it from the accident?,The primary injury was an inverted U shaped laceration on the face and was treated with a surgical incision.,The primary injury was hematemesis and was treated with dehydration therapy.,"The primary injury was nasal bone fracture and complex nasal laceration, which were treated with a repair procedure by plastic surgery.",The primary injury was a maxillary sinus fracture and was treated with facial contouring.,"The primary injury was a nasal/maxillary bone fracture, treated by intensive physiotherapy.",C,"The primary injury due to the motor vehicle accident for this patient was a nasal bone fracture and complex nasal laceration. The summary mentions that plastic surgery was involved for the management of these injuries and a repair procedure was performed. While choices A, B, D, and E do mention things that happened or conditions that were present during the patient's admission, they either do not reflect the primary injury from the accident or the main procedure used to treat it."
48,1,18812536,What was the primary intervention performed for the patient's exertional angina reflected in the discharge summary charted on 2165-01-11 and how did he respond post-surgery?,"The patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft x5 and had complications post-surgery, with persistent chest pain.","The patient had a cardiac catheterization, and his condition worsened post-surgery, with signs of myocardial infarction.","The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft x3, with uneventful post-surgery period, showing signs of good recovery.","The patient was given medication for controlling exertional angina, but his condition did not improve post-treatment.","The patient was advised to undertake a change in lifestyle, but he showed no significant improvements post-advice.",C,"In the discharge summary, it is mentioned that the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x3 as the primary intervention for his exertional angina. His post-surgery period was uneventful and there was no mention of any severe complications or worsening condition, hinting towards a favourable recovery. Rest of the options do not correspond correctly with the details mentioned, making them wrong but plausible distractors. For instance, options A and B suggest incorrect surgical procedures or adverse post-surgery results; option D refers to medication control which was not the primary intervention; option E suggests lifestyle modification, which again was not the main performed intervention."
49,1,19070057,What was the final diagnosis of the patient on discharge?,The patient was diagnosed with severe dehydration.,The diagnosis was abdominal pain.,The patient was diagnosed with a lower respiratory tract infection.,The patient was diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction and thickened bowel wall.,The patient was diagnosed with spontaneous pneumothorax.,D,"In distillation of the Discharge Diagnosis section of the report, the patient's final diagnosis was a small bowel obstruction (abbreviated as SBO) along with a thickened bowel wall. Incorrect choices are as follows: A is incorrect because there's no evidence of severe dehydration in the discharge diagnosis. B is incorrect as abdominal pain was the patient's chief complaint on admission, not the final diagnosis. C is incorrect because there's no evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection in the discharge diagnosis. E is incorrect because the spontaneous pneumothorax was part of the patient's past medical history, not the final diagnosis on discharge."
50,1,10733118,"What is the patient's mobility status, medications and their regime, as well as the main plan of care post operation for the right distal femur fracture?","The patient is fully mobile, prescribed Tramadol and Lovenox, and advised to return to hospital for wound monitoring after 2 weeks.","The patient requires assistance or aid to move, is taking Paracetamol and Senna daily, and should notice improvement in tiredness a few days to a week post-surgery.","The patient is bedridden, taking Acetaminophen daily and OxyCODONE as needed, with the expected course of post-discharge including regular activity resumption.","The patient requires assistance or aid to move, is taking several medication including Enoxaparin Sodium and Oxycodone as needed, and has been issued precaution and follow up care instructions post-operation.","The patient is fully mobile, prescribed Levothyroxine Sodium for hypothyroidism, and the plan of care includes monitoring for constipation due to narcotic pain relievers use.",D,"The patient's mobility is limited and they require an aid to move around post-surgery. The medications they're supposed to take include Acetaminophen, Enoxaparin Sodium, Oxycodone amongst others which have routine, daily or need-based administration post-operation. Detailed instructions have been given to the patient regarding post-operation care such as medication management, weight-bearing precautions, and wound care. Even though the other options include some aspects of the patient's status, no other option presents the entirety of the patient's condition or the medications prescribed. Option E incorrectly states that patient is fully mobile and does not mention the complete discharge medication list and the necessary regime."
51,2,13615258,What was the patient's condition during her second visit and what treatment was administered along with its subsequent care instructions?,"The patient was suffering from a severe UTI and undergone left laser lithotripsy. Post-operative care included medication for pain relief and antibiotics, with a counselor for stent removal after a week.","The patient complained of left flank pain and was subjected to Percutaneous Nephrostomy placement, and antibiotics were administered intravenously.",The patient was diagnosed with recurrent nephrolithiasis and was given an INR reversal. She was to return to the hospital after two weeks for PCNL.,"The patient was suffering from nephrolithiasis, underwent C-section and was instructed not to lift heavy items for four weeks and to continue antibiotics.","The patient was suffering from intense left back pain post-surgery, was given a house diet, was instructed to maintain hydration for two weeks, and underwent a laser lithotripsy procedure again.",C,"In the patient's second visit, it was mentioned that she was experiencing right flank pain. She was admitted to the hospital for pain control and INR reversal as her INR was high. After that, she underwent a Percutaneous Nephrostomy placement and was given IV antibiotics for pain control and hydration. The patient's post-care instructions involved her taking antibiotics for 12 additional days to handle the suspected Enterococcus infection and a return visit for a PCNL in 2 weeks.  Options A, B, D and E are incorrect, although they include details from the hospital visits, they do not correctly describe the condition and treatment during the second visit."
52,2,18361047,What was the treatment provided for Pelvic inflammatory disease during the patient's hospitalization on 2198-10-31 and what were her discharge medications?,Treatment involved bilateral tonsillectomy. The patient was discharged with prescriptions for Acetaminophen 650 mg and OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 5 mg.,Patient was treated using IV antibiotics and was discharged with ibuprofen as needed.,Invasive procedure was performed and the patient was given Ranitidin as a discharge medication.,"The patient was given IV gentamicin and clindamycin for 24 hours, followed by 1g oral azithromycin. Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed Prenatal Vitamins and Acetaminophen.",IV medications were applied and the patient was discharged with prenatal vitamins.,D,"The correct answer is (D) because it accurately reflects the provided treatment for the patient's Pelvic inflammatory disease- IV gentamicin and clindamycin for 24 hours followed by oral azithromycin. For discharge, the patient was prescribed Prenatal Vitamins and Acetaminophen. In contrast, (A) details treatment for chronic tonsillitis, not pelvic inflammatory disease. (B) only partially represents the treatment applied without the complete medication list in discharge. (C) talks about an invasive procedure and a drug (Ranitidin) that the patient is allergic to, hence is incorrect. Option (E) gives only a partial answer, completely omitting the oral azithromycin and wrongfully stating that the patient was given IV medications and was discharged only with prenatal vitamins."
53,2,16823272,What surgical procedures did the patient undergo related to her right knee pain complaint and the right submandibular mass?,The patient underwent surgery for the knee cap alignment and excision of the right parotid gland.,The patient had a surgical procedure for right otitis media and osteoarthritis of the knee.,The patient had a surgical procedure done for a knee replacement on the right and excision of a submandibular mass with a level 1 neck dissection on the right.,The patient had Arthroscopic meniscus repair on the right knee and excision of a mass in the right mandible region.,The patient had an operation to remove a mass from the right occipital lobe and a knee replacement.,C,"The discharge note summary reveals that the patient underwent two separate surgical procedures. The orthopedic surgery was a right total knee replacement to address her complaint of right knee pain, and the otolaryngology procedure was an excision of the right submandibular mass, coupled with a level 1 neck dissection. This information matches with option C. The other options include surgeries not mentioned in the discharge note (option A - knee cap alignment and parotid gland removal; option B - otitis media; option D - Arthroscopic meniscus repair and mandible mass excision; option E - mass excision from right occipital lobe)."
54,2,17238104,What were the symptoms that led to the patient's re-admission and subsequent re-exploration surgery on the L3-L4 area post the initial L3-4 discectomy?,The patient experienced a sudden increase in back pain associated with high fever and chills.,The patient reported afebrile status and persistent pain on her left leg.,"The patient was re-admitted havihg a sudden increase in the pain, weakness on the left lower extremity and shock-like pain down her left buttock radiating down her leg up to the knee.",The patient had experienced refusal of oral food intake and constant vomiting.,The patient was experiencing persistent loss of sensation in her lower extremities.,C,"The discharge summaries indicate that the patient was re-admitted due to a sudden increase in pain after her initial L3-4 discectomy, along with weakness in her left lower extremity and a radiating shocking pain from her left buttock to the knee. Choice A and D was ruled out because notes indicated that she denied any fever and she showed good oral food intake with no indication of vomiting. Choice B was not correct because while the patient did experience pain, it was not the sole reason for her readmission. The weakness that was also crucial was missing in this choice. Choice E was also incorrect because the patient didn't present persistent loss of sensation in her lower extremities."
55,2,17393095,"What is the reason for the patient’s second admission, and what treatment was provided during this stay?",The patient was admitted for another TURP procedure and received continuous bladder irrigation.,The patient was admitted due to clot retention which was cleared using continuous bladder irrigation.,The patient's primary admission reason was urinary infection and received antibiotic treatment.,The patient was admitted again for BPH and was treated with oral pain medication.,The patient was primarily admitted due to the persistence of bleeding and treated with electrocautery.,B,"According to the second note, the patient's second admission was due to clot retention (as mentioned in the Chief Complaint and Discharge Diagnosis sections) and the clot was cleared on continuous bladder irrigation as stated in the Brief Hospital Course section. Option A is incorrect because the patient did not have another TURP procedure during the second hospital stay. Option C is incorrect because urinary infection was not mentioned as the reason for the second admission. Option D is incorrect because BPH was the reason for the first admission, not the second. Option E is incorrect because persistent bleeding was not the reason for the second admission as per the discharge summary."
56,2,11733720,What clinical intervention was provided to the patient during her hospital admission on 2171-05-26 and why?,The patient was administered vaginal progesterone due to a short cervix diagnosed with an ultrasound,The patient underwent a urethral dilation procedure due to urinary retention,The patient was treated with betamethasone due to episodes of preterm contractions,The patient was put under surveillance following a tonsillectomy,The patient was treated with medications for urinary tract infection symptoms,C,"The discharge summary from 2171-05-26 (note 2) indicates that the patient was admitted to the hospital due to an episode of preterm contractions. She was treated with betamethasone to aid in lung maturation in case of premature birth. Although the patient was also administered vaginal progesterone, the note indicates that it started earlier due to a short cervix diagnosis (note 1) and continued during the hospital admission. The other options are incorrect as: Urethral dilation procedure (option B) and patient being put under surveillance following a tonsillectomy (option D) are mentioned as past surgical history, and the urinary tract infection treatment (option E) is not mentioned in the discharge summary."
57,2,15679116,What were the major surgical procedures undergone by the patient's during her two admissions and what were the main treatments given?,The patient underwent a Shirodkar cerclage during the first admission and no surgical procedure was conducted during the second admission. The treatments given were prenatal vitamins and vaginal progesterone.,"The patient had an ultrasound indicated cerclage in her first admission and a cervical lengthening procedure in her second admission, along with medication treatment such as prenatal vitamins.",The patient took progesterone 200 mg vaginal mainly during her first admission and underwent a betamethasone administration in the second one.,"During her first admission, the patient underwent a laparoscopic surgery and during her second admission, she had a Shirodkar cerclage.","In the first admission, the patient had a prosthetamine therapy and ablation surgery was performed during her second admission.",A,"From note 1 and note 2, the patient underwent a major surgical procedure called ""cervical cerclage"" during her first admission, in which a suture is placed around the cervix to help prevent premature birth. This is the reason why answer choice E, D, B and E are incorrect. No surgical procedure was performed during her second admission, making answer choices B, D and E wrong. The treatments mentioned in the discharge summary include prenatal vitamins and vaginal progesterone in both admissions and thus, making choice C incorrect as betamethasone was not the primary treatment."
58,2,19686304,"What was the outcome of the patient's second ERCP, and did she exhibit any adverse effects post-procedure?",The patient had immediate relief after the procedure but showed abnormal LFT results.,The patient experienced severe epigastric pain that radiated to the back following the procedure.,The patient underwent ERCP with no removal of CBD stones and developed abdominal pain.,The patient experienced relief of the symptoms and was discharged with strict follow-up instructions.,"The patient had immediate relief, however, showed symptoms of chemical jaundice post-procedure.",B,"In note 2, it is mentioned that after the second ERCP and removal of several Common Bile Duct (CBD) stones, the patient developed severe epigastric pain radiating to the back. Other options are incorrect because: A: While the patient did have immediate relief after the first ERCP (as mentioned in note 1), there's no mention about abnormal LFT results after the second procedure. C: The second ERCP resulted in the removal of several CBD stones, and the patient did experience pain afterward, but it was epigastric, not abdominal. D: This statement reflects the outcome of the first ERCP (note 1), not the second one. E: The second ERCP was successful in CBD stone removal but ended in severe rather than immediate relief as stated. Additionally, chemical jaundice was the reason for the procedure, not after."
59,2,19538733,Did the patient's hemoglobin levels improve from 2166-11-22 to 2167-08-25?,The hemoglobin levels remained the same.,The hemoglobin levels worsened from 9.0 to 0.9.,There was no record of hemoglobin levels on 2167-08-25.,The hemoglobin levels improved from 9.0 to 11.6.,The hemoglobin levels were inconsistent throughout the period.,D,"Looking at the discharge summary from 2166-11-22 and 2167-08-25, we can see that the haemoglobin levels did change. On 2166-11-22, the patient's hemoglobin levels were recorded at 9.0 (Hgb-9.0) and improved to 11.6 (Hgb-11.6) by 2167-08-25. Choice D is correct. Choice A, B, C, and E are incorrect, because the records indicate that the hemoglobin levels improved, not stayed the same, worsened, weren't recorded, or were inconsistent; the records clearly show an improvement of the levels from 9.0 to 11.6."
60,2,16781251,What was the patient's alcoholism status during her second admission to the hospital?,She refused AMA forms and left the hospital.,She was intoxicated.,She drank a 2L bottle of wine and a pint of vodka which resulted in coffee ground emesis.,Her alcoholism status was sober for several years.,"She has a family history of alcoholism, leading to her own condition.",D,"The second admission to the hospital was for a procedure pertaining to cervical dysplasia. The patient's alcoholism status during this particular admission was ""sober for ___ years"" as mentioned in the past medical history section. The other options A, B, C, and E are incorrect as they all refer to details from the first admission, which was primarily concerning the patient's alcohol abuse. For example, option A refers to the patient's refusal to sign the Against Medical Advice (AMA) form, B refers to the state the patient arrived in during the first admission, C refers to a detailed incident on the day of the first admission where the patient drank a lot of alcohol, and E refers to her family history of alcoholism. Despite being factual, they are not connected to the patient's alcoholism status during her second admission."
61,2,12068421,What was the main reason behind the patient's second hospital admission after his original bilateral tonsillectomy?,The patient was admitted for a routine post-operative check.,The patient had severe pain after the surgery and needed additional pain management.,"The patient experienced bleeding post-surgery, necessitating treatment.",The patient was suffering from a tonsillar fossae infection after the surgery.,"The patient was admitted for a separate, unrelated health issue.",C,"The discharge summaries of the patient reveal that the primary reason for the subsequent hospital admission was due to post-tonsillectomy bleeding (""tonsil bleed"") as indicated multiple times as the Chief Complaint and other areas in both notes. Answer A can be misleading but not correct because routine post-operative check is part of after-surgery care and should not lead to admission. Answer B is incorrect as the patient needed pain management but it was not the main cause of the second admission. Answer D is misleading as there's no documented evidence of tonsillar fossae infection after surgery. Answer E is also incorrect as the notes do not contain any indication of an unrelated health issue leading to hospital admission."
62,2,11258755,What is the patient’s past and recent history of dental surgeries?,The patient had a dental surgery to repair a tooth cavity.,The patient applied bone wax therapy and clorhexidine mouthwash for his teeth.,"Mandibular fractures, open reduction, internal fixation, maxillary screws, and wiring surgeries were performed.",The patient underwent tonsil removal surgery.,The patient had surgical repair of an impacted wisdom tooth.,C,"The correct answer is choice C which correctly paraphrases the dental surgical procedures both described in Note 1 and Note 2 about the patient. The options A, D, and E are irrelevant because there is no information in both of the case notes that mention these dental procedures. Choice B talks about the post-care instructions for the healing of surgery wounds rather than about any surgical procedures that were performed."
63,2,12255689,What direct preventive measures were assumed for the patient during treatment due to her condition having a short cervix?,She underwent a surgical procedure to implant a pacemaker.,She was initiated on a regime involving antibiotics.,A cerclage was placed on her cervix and vaginal progesterone was administered.,The patient received iron supplements to treat anemia.,She was given medication to treat her urinary tract infection.,C,"The correct answer is C, the patient had a cerclage placed on her cervix and then started on vaginal progesterone. From the discharge summary, this information can be derived as she was diagnosed with a 'short cervix' and a rescue cerclage was performed on her. Post operation, she was started on vaginal progesterone, indicating this as a direct preventative measure due to her condition.  Option A is incorrect as there is no mention of any pacemaker placement or any cardiovascular issues. Option B is incorrect because while antibiotics are mentioned in the charts, they were started for potential infection concerns, not as a direct preventative measure for her short cervix. Option D is incorrect because there is no mention of her having anemia or being treated with iron supplements. Finally, option E is also incorrect as there is no mention of UTI treatment apart from her initial complaint. While she complained of a possible UTI, the notes don't mention it as a confirmed diagnosis or ongoing treatment."
64,2,16199089,What was the patient's condition at discharge after the laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy?,The patient was in discomfort with an infected incision.,"The patient was in a critical condition, having difficulty with diet and unable to ambulate.","The patient was stable, eating properly, moving independently, urinating without difficulty, and managing pain with oral medicines.",The patient was discharged with severe gastrointestinal symptoms and was dehydrated.,The patient was released with unregulated pain levels and unable to maintain a regular diet.,C,"In the patient's discharge note, it is clearly mentioned that at discharge after the laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy, the patient was eating well, ambulating independently, able to urinate without difficulty and had pain controlled on oral analgesics. This matches with choice C.   A is incorrect because there's no mention of discomfort or infected incision.   B is not correct as the patient was stated to be stable and not in a critical condition.  Option D is a distractor because the patient's discharge summary doesn't suggest any severe gastrointestinal symptoms or dehydration.   Choice E is incorrect as the patient's pain was well-managed with oral medicines and was maintaining diet at discharge."
65,2,13286150,What were the initial clinical symptoms that led to the patient's admission on the chart dated 2137-03-25 and how was his condition treated during this hospital course?,Patient experienced a spike in PSA which led to diagnosis of prostate cancer. He was treated with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.,"Patient was admitted for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. He was treated with Intravenous Fluid rehydration and a nasogastric tube was placed. ",Patient presented feeling of incomplete emptying and weak stream along with an elevated AUA symptom score. The treatment included robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.,"Patient was hospitalized due to unstable cardiac conditions. He was treated through medication management including Carvedilol, Vytorin, and Losartan.","Chief complaint was CAD s/p MI and cardiac stents which were managed by continuation of his home dose of Carvedilol, Losartan, and Vytorin.",B,"According to the information from note 2, dated 2137-03-25, the patient was admitted due to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. His course of treatment included IVF rehydration and NGT placement. Although options A, C, D, and E are all mentioned in the patient's history, they are not the direct cause of this admission or the associated treatment. The date for these events (prostate cancer diagnosis and its associated treatment, cardiac conditions and related treatments) does not match the question's specified date."
66,2,13294325,"What was the major surgical procedure performed on the patient during the visit on 2184-09-03, and what was it for?",The patient had a rotator cuff reconstruction to treat right shoulder pain.,The patient underwent incision and drainage to relieve pain in the right shoulder.,The patient was treated with oral antibiotics for cellulitis in the right index finger.,The patient had incision and drainage to treat infection in the right index finger.,The patient was diagnosed and treated for high blood pressure and high cholesterol.,D,"The patient underwent a surgery on the date 2184-09-03 that involves incision and drainage to treat an infection in the right index finger, as stated in note 2. All other options are incorrect for the following reasons. Option A is incorrect because the rotator cuff reconstruction occurred during a different procedure in 2181 as per note 1. Option B is incorrect because the surgery did not aim to relieve pain in the right shoulder. Option C is incorrect because, although the patient had a history of cellulitis, the treatment was not through an oral antibiotic. Option E is incorrect because though the patient has a medical history of high blood pressure and cholesterol, it does not relate to the surgery performed on 2184-09-03."
67,2,13536206,"What was the primary reason for admitting the patient during her first and second visits, and what were the major surgical procedures performed?","The patient was admitted for treating diabetes and hypertension, and she had an invasive insulin procedure.","The patient was admitted due to allergic reactions to Celebrex and Penicillin, and she underwent a desensitization protocol.","The patient was admitted for bilateral varicose veins during the first visit and right leg varicose veins for the second visit. Her surgeries were varicose vein ligation and stripping on the left side, and excision of varicosities from the right lower extremity along with saphenous vein stripping during the second admission.","The patient was admitted due to significant swelling and pain in her legs, and she had compression dressings changed.","The patient was admitted for leg pain and weakness, and she underwent physical therapy during her stay.",C,"The patient's chief complaints, the reasons for her admissions, were bilateral varicose veins during her first visit and varicose veins in the right leg during her second visit, as stated in the 'chief complaint' sections of the notes. The major surgical procedures she underwent were varicose vein ligation and stripping, done on her left leg during the first visit, and excision of varicosities from her right lower extremity and stripping of the saphenous vein as stated in the 'major surgical or invasive procedure' sections of the notes. Answer choices A, B, D, and E do not align with the specifics mentioned in the provided notes. Only choice C correctly outlines the primary reasons for her admissions and the major surgeries she underwent."
68,2,17308959,What were the medical procedures carried out for miscarriage and which complications arose during patient's second admission on 2122-09-22?,The patiet underwent birth control pills for abortion and faced an ectopic pregnancy.,The patient underwent intramuscular progesterone and experienced internal bleeding.,The patient had a cerclage procedure and reported an allergic reaction.,"The patient experienced a miscarriage followed by the removal of cerclage, repair of cervical defect, dilation and curettage for retained placenta, with complications including cervical laceration and presumed chorioamnionitis.",The patient underwent a dilation and curettage procedure and suffered from puerperal infection.,D,"The medical procedures carried out for the miscarriage during the patient's second admission were the removal of the cerclage, repair of the cervical defect, and dilation and curettage for retained placenta. The complications involved cervix tearing from the cerclage and a possible infection of the chorionic membrane (chorioamnionitis). As per the discharge history, no other options accurately describe any procedures carried out or complications faced. For example, birth control pills (Option A) and intramuscular progesterone (Option B) were not performed nor reported during this admission. Similarly, no allergic reaction was reported (Option C) nor did she suffer from a puerperal infection (Option E)."
69,2,11524050,What was the major surgical or invasive procedure performed during the patient's second admission due to recurrent right pneumothorax?,Right chest tube/dart placement for pneumothorax,Administration of hydromorphone pain management,"Right video-assisted thoracoscopy, blebectomy with mechanical and chemical pleurodesis",Knee Surgery,Placement of right pigtail catheter for drainage,C,"The correct answer is mentioned in the second note where it is stated that 'Right Video-assisted thoracoscopy, blebectomy with mechanical and chemical pleurodesis' was the major surgical or invasive procedure performed.   The option A is incorrect because the 'Right chest tube/dart placement for pneumothorax' procedure was carried out during the patient's first admission (mentioned under 'major surgical or invasive procedure' in the first note), not the second.   B is wrong as hydromorphone is a medication given for managing pain, not a surgical or invasive procedure.  Although. 'Knee Surgery' mentioned in the patient's past medical history in both notes, this was not the invasive procedure performed during the second admission, hence, option D is wrong.  The option E is incorrect because the placement of a right pigtail catheter for drainage did happen but during the patient's first admission not the second. This can be seen under 'Brief Hospital Course' in the first note."
70,2,16652338,What change was made to the patient's medications between her first and second admission?,The patient was discharged with a prescription for Nitroglycerin SL 0.4 mg during the second admission.,The patient was given glyBURIDE-metformin during her first admission but not during her second.,"In the first medical admission, the patient was provided sertraline which was not present in the second admission.",The patient was prescribed Zoloft 50 mg during her second admission but was not during her first admission.,The patient was put on a regimen of Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg during her first admission but not during her second admission.,D,"The patient’s medications between the time of first admission and second admission changed, which included Zoloft 50 mg. The notes confirm that sertraline was provided in both admissions (note D is not contradicting this because Zoloft is a brand name for Sertraline), making option C incorrect. Option A, B and E are incorrect as Nitroglycerin SL 0.4 mg, glyBURIDE-metformin and Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg were part of both the first and second discharge medications list."
71,2,14703330,What was the reason for the patient's second admission to the hospital and what interventions were performed during this visit?,The patient was admitted due to a right renal mass and was treated with a right laparoscopic nephrectomy.,"The patient was admitted for evisceration occurring approximately 5 hours prior and was treated with the closure of the wound, possible resection of small bowel.",The patient was admitted for a wound dehiscence and was treated with a hand assisted right laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.,The patient was readmitted for renal mass and was treated with perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.,The patient was readmitted for left arm swelling and was treated with vancomycin for presumed thrombophlebitis.,B,"The second note indicates that the patient was readmitted due to a wound dehiscence and intervention performed was the closure of the wound, and a possible resection small bowel was carried out. Option A is from the patient's first admission, not the second. Options C and D are incorrect as the nephrectomy was performed during the first admission, not the second. Option E is incorrect because the left arm swelling was treated during the first admission and not the reason for the second admission."
72,2,19430691,"What was the cause of the patient's recurrent fever post partum, and what intervention was made during the second admission on 2185-12-20?","The patient's recurrent fever was due to breast engorgement, and no treatment was performed.","The patient's recurrent fever was because of urinary tract infection, and was treated with antibiotics.","The patient's recurrent fever was due to retained products of conception, and a dilation and curettage was performed.","The patient's recurrent fever was due to appendicitis, and an appendectomy was performed.","The patient's recurrent fever was due to postpartum depression, and counseling was provided.",C,"In the discharge note of the patient's second admission dated 2185-12-20, it was mentioned that the patient was admitted with fevers at home and an ultrasound confirmed that a ""2x2cm mass consistent with Retained Products of Conception (RPOC) at the right cornua."" After the RPOC was confirmed, a dilation and curettage was performed under ultrasound guidance. Hence, C is the right answer.   Answer A is incorrect because the patient had a fever due to endometritis initially but not due to breast engorgement. Answer B is also incorrect as it was mentioned that the ""UA was negative"" and there was no reference to a urinary tract infection (UTI). As for D, there was no mention of appendicitis in the note. Similarly, E is also incorrect as the patient had physical symptoms, not psychological symptoms as in postpartum depression. Therefore, options A, B, D, and E are good distractors."
73,2,10903410,What was the main consequence during the patient's delivery and how was it managed?,The patient experienced a rectal prolapse which was treated with physical therapy.,The patient had a deep vein thrombosis and received a therapeutic dose of lovenox 24 hours after delivery.,The patient experienced difficulty in delivering the placenta which needed a cesarean section.,"The patient had an upper extremity clot, for which she was given tylenol and Roxicet.","The patient suffered from failure to deliver the placenta, which was managed via a dilation and curettage procedure in the operating room.",E,"According to the notes, during her delivery, the patient had trouble delivering the placenta, so it had to be removed using a dilation and curettage procedure in the operating room. This is reflected in choice E. Although the patient did have a history of an upper extremity DVT as stated in option B and D, this was not the primary complication during delivery, B is incorrect as it is related to the post delivery procedure not during. In option A, although it can be a complication, the patient did not have a rectal prolapse during her delivery. Similarly, the patient did not have difficulty that required a Cesarean section, making option C incorrect. Option D is incorrect as it refers to the incident prior to the actual delivery."
74,2,14736532,What were the two major surgical procedures the patient had to undergo during his two visits to the hospital and for what reasons?,The patient underwent an anterior lumbar fusion to treat back and leg pain and a cystic removal due to a lumbar intradural hematoma.,The patient underwent a posterior fusion surgery to treat depression and an anterior lumbar fusion to manage back and leg pain.,The patient underwent a laminectomy to treat a lumbar intradural hematoma and an anterior lumbar fusion due to depression.,The patient had a revision lami/fusion L2-L3 to treat back and leg pain and an anterior lumbar fusion due to lumbar spondylosis and disc degeneration.,The patient had a cyst removal due to a lumbar intradural hematoma and a posterior fusion surgery due to depression.,D,"The patient first underwent a revision of laminectomy and fusion surgery at level L2-L3 due to chronic back and leg pain (found in note 1). During his second hospital visit, he had an anterior lumbar fusion surgery from level L2-5 because of continual back and leg pain and due to lumbar spondylosis and disc degeneration (found in note 2). Options A, B, and C incorrectly relates the reasons for surgery. Option E incorrectly refers to the initial surgery as a cyst removal and mentions a non-existent posterior fusion surgery."
75,2,19865616,What change was made in the patient's hypertension management strategy during her second hospital visit as charted on 2179-06-30?,The patient was discharged without any antihypertensive treatment,The dosage for patient's Nifedipine medication was increased,Treatment was shifted from Nifedipine to Labtalol,Patient was advised to take Nifedipine along with Percocet,The patient's Nifedipine medication remained unchanged during the visit,C,"The correct answer is C because in the second note (chart dated 2179-06-30), it was mentioned that ""Nifedipine was discontinued and she was started on labetolol 400TID."" So, her hypertension management strategy was changed from using Nifedipine to labetolol. All other answer choices are incorrect but can be good distractors as they are based on information found within the notes. ""B"" is incorrect as the dose of Nifedipine was not increased, but it was discontinued.  ""E"" is not correct as Nifedipine use was stopped. ""D"" is incorrect as there is no mention of Percocet being used with Nifedipine in the second note. ""A"" is a plausible distractor because the patient was discharged, but it incorrectly suggests that the patient was discharged without medication. The second note confirms that the patient was discharged with labetalol."
76,2,19176398,What was the cause of left flank echymosis in the patient’s subsequent visit to the hospital?,The patient fell out of bed causing a left flank echymosis.,A fluid filled lung cyst resulted in left flank echymosis.,"The patient had a large bleed in the left psoas muscle, resulting in left flank echymosis.","Due to upper respiratory tract infection, the patient developed left flank echymosis.",The left flank echymosis was caused by the L hip ORIF procedure.,C,"The correct answer is C because as mentioned in the second note, the patient had a large left psoas muscle bleed which resulted in left flank echymosis. Option A is incorrect because there is no mention of physical trauma such as a fall in the summary. Option B is wrong since the fluid-filled lung cyst did not cause the echymosis per the notes. For Option D, the upper respiratory tract infection was during the previous visit and not related to the echymosis in the subsequent visit. Last, for option E, no direct correlation is mentioned between the L hip ORIF procedure and the echymosis. Although the patient did have this procedure and was on a blood thinner, the blood thinning medicine's role in causing bleeding in the psoas muscle is not directly related to the ORIF procedure itself."
77,2,16233831,What were the primary reasons for both of this patient's hospital admissions as mentioned in the notes charted on 2133-11-19 and 2134-08-01?,Arm pain and Abdominal pain,Respiratory distress and Hypertension,Epilepsy and Hypothermia,Cervical stenosis and Menometrorrhagia with uterine fibroids,Headache and Leg cramps,D,"The notes from 2133-11-19 reveal that the patient was admitted to the hospital due to cervical stenosis, and her post-operative course involved ACDF (Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion). This can be inferred from the Discharge Diagnosis that mentions ""Cervical stenosis."" On 2134-08-01, the patient was admitted due to menometrorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding) and uterine fibroids. This is indicated in the Chief Complaint and is confirmed in the patient's Discharge Diagnosis, which lists ""Uterine Fibroids."" The other options, though they make use of terms found within the discharge summaries, do not accurately reflect the primary reasons for the patient's admissions."
78,2,12896226,What was the major surgical procedure conducted during the patient's second visit and how was her condition during her discharge following the procedure?,"The patient's second visit involved a RLE suction lipectomy, and she was in a state of clear mental status and fully active upon discharge.","During her second visit, the patient underwent a procedure for her bilateral lymphedema, and she was able to ambulate and void on her own after the surgery.","The major surgical procedure during the patient's second visit was an EXCISION LIPEDEMA LOWER EXTREMITY LEFT procedure, and she was clear and coherent, alert and interactive, and could walk independently upon her discharge.","The patient was treated for her lower extremity lymphedema in her second visit, and she had an easy work of breathing on room air after the procedure.","In the patient's second visit, she had a procedure for her migraines, and she was resting comfortably and conversant after the operation.",C,"The notes from the second visit outline that an EXCISION LIPEDEMA LOWER EXTREMITY LEFT procedure was performed, and the discharge condition was noted as being clear and coherent, alert and interactive, and she could walk independently. The other choices mention procedures or conditions that were not the focus of the patient's second visit (such as RLE suction lipectomy, treatment for bilateral lymphedema, and treatment for migraines). While the information on the patient's condition in the incorrect choices is not false (e.g., patient was ambulating and voiding on her own, etc.), it is not related to her second visit specifically."
79,2,14258334,What was the diagnosis and treatment given to the patient when he was admitted with Left Lower Quadrant / flank pain and Nausea/Vomiting on the chartdate 2125-04-03?,The patient was diagnosed with Acne; he received Doxycycline treatment.,"The patient was diagnosed with Nephrolithiasis; he was treated with Zofran IV, Fluid hydration, Flomax for a week, and given Percocet for pain control.",The patient was diagnosed with stable GI Bleed; he was kept under observation with regular Hct checks and treated with IVF and protonix drip.,"The patient was diagnosed with Meckel's disease; however, no treatment was reported.","The patient was diagnosed with GI Bleed; he underwent endoscopy, and a polyp was found.",B,"According to the information present in the discharge summary, the patient was diagnosed with Nephrolithiasis on admission date 2125-04-03. He was treated with Zofran IV, fluid hydration, and for pain control, Percocet was administered; these treatment details match with choice B. On the other hand, choice A is incorrect as the diagnosis was Nephrolithiasis, not Acne, even though the patient had a past medical history of Acne. Choice C pertains to the patient's GI Bleed, diagnosed on a different chartdate (2126-06-16), not the asked date. Choice D is incorrect as the patient's medical history includes a negative result for Meckel's disease, and there was no reported treatment. Choice E is wrong because the diagnosis and the treatment procedure described occurred on a different date (2126-06-16), not the asked date. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
80,2,10282825,What signs of improvement did the patient show after his second admission and how was his condition managed during this hospital stay?,The patient's abdominal distension was resolved and he tolerated a regular diet.,The patient's diverticulitis was cured following the sigmoid colectomy.,The patient was able to take oral medications as opposed to injectables.,"The patient was able to take care of himself independently, without needing nursing care.",The patient's hemoglobin levels returned to normal after the second admission.,A,"After the second admission (note 2), the patient showed improvement by resolving his abdominal distension and tolerating a regular diet (from note 2, ""By HD4, abdominal distension was resolved. Pt tolerated regular diet""). His condition was managed by making him NPO, hydrating with IVF, treating with no narcotic medications, and starting him on a liquid diet as his abdominal distension improved (from note 2, ""KUB showed gas patterns c/w ileus. Pt was made NPO and hydrated w/ IVF. No narcotic medications were given"").   Option B is incorrect as the patient WAS NOT cured from diverticulitis after sigmoid colectomy, in fact, he was readmitted due to issues post this surgery. Option C is incorrect as the patient's form of medication (oral or injectable) wasn't the sign of improvement or managing measure. Option D is incorrect as the patient's independence wasn't highlighted as a sign of improvement or part of his condition management during his second stay. Option E is incorrect because while hemoglobin levels are mentioned in the discharge summary, they were not identified as a key marker of the patient's improvement after the second admission."
81,2,19839003,What was the initial treatment strategy of the patient who presented with a suspicious right thyroid nodule and later diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma?,The patient underwent both a right and left thyroidectomy as the initial treatment strategy.,The initial treatment strategy was ultrasound guided biopsy of the right thyroid nodule.,Papillary thyroid carcinoma was initially treated with Calcium Carbonate 1000 milligram by mouth.,The patient had a right thyroidectomy as the initial treatment strategy.,"The initial treatment strategy was a total thyroidectomy, similar to what a maternal cousin of the patient had a year ago.",D,"The patient initially underwent a right thyroidectomy for a right nodule suspicious for papillary carcinoma (mentioned in note 1). Therefore, choice D is correct. A: is incorrect because the patient underwent the left thyroidectomy only after the pathology came back as papillary cancer from the right thyroidectomy (as stated in note 2). B: The ultrasound-guided biopsy helped diagnose the suspicious nodule but it was not a part of the initial treatment strategy and hence, B is incorrect. C is incorrect because Calcium Carbonate was used post-thyroidectomy to manage the patient's symptoms of low serum calcium, not as an initial treatment. E: is incorrect because the patient did not undergo a total thyroidectomy as the initial strategy of treatment but her maternal cousin underwent a total thyroidectomy a year ago. That is not indicative of the patient's treatment strategy."
82,2,16805446,What was the patient's discharge diagnosis during her visit on 2148-09-14 and has there been any significant changes during her subsequent visit on 2148-10-11?,"The patient was diagnosed with backache and kidney stone during her first visit, and during her next visit, she had gestational hypertension.","The diagnosis during her first visit was decreased fetal movements, the next visit revealed no significant changes.","The patient was first diagnosed with FTCS, and on her second visit she was diagnosed with GDMA1.","She was initially diagnosed with nephrolithiasis, followed by a diagnosis of mental instability during her second visit.","On the first visit, the patient was diagnosed with GDMA1, and during the second visit she was diagnosed with back pain.",A,"The discharge diagnosis after the first visit on 2148-09-14 was ""back pain, right kidney stone"" as mentioned in the first note. On her next visit on 2148-10-11, her discharge diagnosis changed to ""gestational hypertension"" as stated in the second note. Therefore answer A is accurate. Answer B is incorrect because the first diagnosis was not decreased fetal movements. Answers C, D, and E are also incorrect as they do not align with the discharge diagnoses mentioned in both notes."
83,2,11331454,What were the symptoms the patient presented with in the second admission and did any new medications were added to the list from the first admission?,The patient exhibited symptoms of consistent flank pain and was added docusate sodium to his medication list.,The patient presented symptoms of mild dysuria and was prescribed additional ibuprofen.,"The patient had symptoms of nausea, chills and severe right flank pain and ciprofloxacin was added to his medications.","The patient showed signs of vomiting and fever, with acetaminophen being added to his medication regimen.",The patient had severe abdominal pain and was prescribed extra oxycodone in his medication list.,C,"In the second admission notes, the patient presented symptoms of nausea, vomit, chills, and severe right flank pain. Additionally, ciprofloxacin was added to the list of his medications on admission. Although the other choices contain contents from the notes, they are either incorrect symptoms presented in the second admission (A, B, D, E) or incorrect additions to the medication list (A, B, D, E). Hence, they can serve as good distractors."
84,2,16678196,What was the cause of the patient's lower extremity weakness during her second visit and what was done to manage it?,"The patient experienced lower extremity weakness due to her previous admission's lumbar fusion surgery, and she was rehabilitated using physical therapy.","The patient developed lower extremity weakness due to the side effects of her medications, and her dosage was adjusted to manage it.","The patient's lower extremity weakness was due to a fluid collection in the lumbar region, which was drained using CT-guided drainage.","The patient's lower extremity weakness resulted from decreased blood counts, and she was managed with blood transfusions.","The patient experienced lower extremity weakness due to the cessation of her physical therapy, and she had to resume her sessions.",C,"In note 2, we can see that the patient developed weakness in her lower extremities because of a fluid collection in the lumbar region, as revealed by an MRI. To manage this, the patient was sent for a CT-guided drainage procedure, which led to the improvement of her symptoms. Therefore, choice C is correct.   Choice A is incorrect because, although the patient had a lumbar fusion surgery during her first visit, her weakness during the second visit resulted from a fluid collection and not directly from the previous surgery. Choice B is incorrect because the notes don't suggest that her medication led to the development of her symptoms. They were managed by draining the fluid collection, not adjusting her medication. Choice D is incorrect because her blood counts were not indicated as a contributing factor to the patient's lower extremity weakness. Therefore, the method of management suggested (blood transfusions) is irrelevant. Choice E is incorrect because the patient did not stop attending physical therapy. It was the fluid collection that caused the weakness, and it required drainage, not the resumption of physical therapy."
85,2,17393308,What was the reason for the patient's second admission to the hospital and what was the intervention conducted to manage it?,The patient was admitted for hypertension and was treated with Hydrochlorothiazide.,The patient was admitted for colon cancer and underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.,The patient was admitted for a right colectomy and was then monitored and received post-operative care.,The patient was admitted due to vaginal bleeding and was treated with vaginal packing.,The patient was admitted for hypertension and received ibuprofen and percocet.,D,"The patient's second admission to the hospital, as recorded in the second note, was due to vaginal bleeding while the intervention performed to manage it was vaginal packing. The other options are incorrect choices but are good distractors as they contain information derived from the notes. Option A and E incorrectly cite hypertension as the cause for admission, a part of her medical history, but not the reason for the second admission. Option B and C are incorrect as they are related to her first admission, detailing the prophylactic measures taken due to her history of colon cancer, but are not related to the second admission."
86,2,18216716,What were the findings from the CT-guided aspiration of abdominal fluid collections and what was the subsequent treatment plan implemented during the patient's second admission?,Three fluid collections were found in the abdominal area and were successfully drained through CT-guided aspiration. The patient was then put on a plan of physical therapy.,The CT-guided aspiration of right lower quadrant collections did not yield any aspirate despite multiple attempts. The patient was then planned to be treated with 2 weeks on antibiotics.,The patient's CT-guided aspiration resulted in a successful extraction of fluid from the abdominal collections. The patient was then put on a course of antiviral medication.,The CT scan showed formation of an abscess in the lower abdomen. The patient was treated with a strong course of steroidal treatment.,"The CT-guided aspiration process successfully retrieved fluid collections, and the patient was then taken to the operating room for an appendectomy.",B,"In the patient's second admission note, it is mentioned that despite multiple attempts at CT guided aspiration of right lower quadrant collections, no aspirate was retrieved. The following treatment planned was to administer antibiotics for 2 weeks. Though options A, C, and E mentioned CT-guided aspiration, results of the procedure mentioned in them were incorrect. Also, the subsequent treatment plans listed in options A, C, D, and E are not found in the provided notes. In option D, the finding of 'abscess formation' is incorrect since the report mentioned 'no free air or abscess formation.'"
87,2,18047194,What was the cause of the patient's right hip wound inflammation and which antibiotic was prescribed for the infection?,The inflammation of the patient's right hip wound was due to a post-surgical infection caused by the aspirin and the antibiotic prescribed was Naproxen.,The patient's right hip wound inflammation originated from dysplasia and the infection was managed with Gabapentin.,The inflammation of the right hip wound was due to a superficial wound infection with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was prescribed Cephalexin for the treatment.,"The cause of the inflammation in the right hip wound was due to the R hip arthroscopy, labral repair, periacetabular osteotomy and the antibiotic used to manage the infection was OxyCODONE.","The patient's right hip wound was inflamed due to the acetabular dysplasia; stabilized labral injury, for which the antibiotic prescribed was Acetaminophen.",C,"The summary in note 2 mentioned that the patient's right hip wound inflammation was due to a superficial infection triggered by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient was treated with the antibiotic Cephalexin. This makes option C correct.   Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as the inflammation was not caused by aspirin, dysplasia, R hip arthroscopy, or acetabular dysplasia. These are distractions with components pulled from different parts of the discharge summary. Also, Naproxen, Gabapentin, OxyCODONE, and Acetaminophen are not antibiotics but are used primarily for pain relief and inflammation, which is why they were incorrect as well."
88,2,10845535,What were the patient's diagnoses upon discharge from her medical and psychiatric treatments after her Tylenol overdose?,Normal mental status and stable vital signs,Adjustment disorder and polysubstance abuse,Partial recovery from a Tylenol overdose,Migraines and a history of substance abuse,Medically cleared for home and given outpatient psychiatric care,B,"The patient was given a discharge diagnosis of adjustment disorder and polysubstance abuse, according to the notes under 'Discharge Diagnosis' in note 2. This took place after being medically cleared from her acetaminophen overdose (also known as Tylenol). This makes the other answers incorrect. 'Normal mental status and stable vital signs' (choice A) describes the patient's condition but not the diagnosis. 'Partial recovery from a Tylenol overdose' (choice C) is incorrect because the patient was medically cleared from the overdose. 'Migraines and a history of substance abuse' (choice D) were part of the patient's past medical history and not her discharge diagnosis. And 'medically cleared for home and given outpatient psychiatric care' (choice E) doesn't clarify the specific diagnoses given upon discharge."
89,2,15592770,What conclusion was made regarding Ms. ___'s postoperative persistent febrile condition and how was it treated based on 2125-10-14's record?,The patient was diagnosed with endometritis and prescribed a prenatal vitamin as treatment.,"The patient was diagnosed with vascular retained products of conception and was treated with ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin for presumed endometritis.","The patient was diagnosed with endometritis, despite showing no growth in blood cultures. She was administered multiple antibiotics including ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin, supplemented by outpatient therapy with Amoxicillin and Clindamycin.",The patient was diagnosed with endometritis and treated with uterotonic medications.,"The patient was diagnosed with pelvic thrombophlebitis, but was treated with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin for presumed endometritis.",C,"Based on the 2125-10-14's record, the conclusion was that Ms. ___ was suffering from endometritis, which was causing her persistent fevers. Despite an extensive search for other infectious sources, she was treated aggressively with broad-spectrum antibiotics including ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin. Even though her blood cultures showed no growth, her symptoms and medical history led to the decision to continue antibiotic therapy. The correct regimen was carried on post-discharge with Amoxicillin and Clindamycin. Option A is incorrect because the prenatal vitamin was not a treatment for her condition. Option B is incorrect as there was no evidence of vascular retained products of conception. Option D is incorrect as uterotonics were used in the procedure to control blood loss, not as a treatment for endometritis. Option E is incorrect as no evidence of pelvic thrombophlebitis was found."
90,2,11194896,"What type of surgery did the patient undergo during their second admission, and how was their pain managed post-operation?","The patient had a laparoscopic resection of the gastrointestinal stomal tumor, and their post-operation pain was managed with IV medications.","The patient underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, and their pain was managed using parenteral narcotics transitioning to oral narcotics supplemented with acetaminophen and ketorolac.","During the second admission, the patient underwent appendectomy, and their pain was managed with Oxycodone-Acetaminophen.","During the second admission, the patient had a laparoscopic resection of the gastrointestinal stomal tumor and was prescribed Tylenol and Ibuprofen for pain management post-operation.","The patient had a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, and their post-op pain was managed with acetaminophen and alprazolam.",B,"In the second admission, the provided notes mention that the patient underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and thereafter, her pain was initially controlled with parenteral narcotics and later transitioned to oral narcotics supplemented with acetaminophen and ketorolac. Options A and D refer to the procedure carried out in the first admission. Option C states an incorrect surgery and medication. Option E is incorrect as it mentions alprazolam, an anxiety medication, as a pain management solution."
91,2,12709581,What could be the possible cause of the patient's Portal Vein Thrombosis as per the note charted on 2138-11-11?,The patient developed Portal Vein Thrombosis due to previous C-section surgeries.,"The patient's brother has ITP, which may have triggered the development of Portal Vein Thrombosis.",Portal Vein Thrombosis could be a postoperative complication from the patient’s previous laparoscopic splenectomy.,The patient's hypertension lead to the development of Portal Vein Thrombosis.,The patient's previous IUD placement initiated Portal Vein Thrombosis.,C,"As per the notes, the patient underwent a laparoscopic splenectomy in the past, and in the later note, Portal Vein Thrombosis is mentioned as a more recent diagnosis. This connection offers a possible cause for the condition as surgical procedures, particularly ones involving abdominal organs, can increase the risk of developing thrombosis due to disturbance of the portal blood flow. Options A, B, D, and E, although mentioned in the medical history, do not directly lead to the mentioned condition and thus provide good distractors. Even if a family member has ITP, it doesn't directly cause Portal Vein Thrombosis, making choice B incorrect. Choices A, D, and E are valid elements of the patient's medical history but not directly tied to the development of Portal Vein Thrombosis."
92,2,17961376,"What were the steps in the medical management of the patient's perforated appendicitis, as inferred from her medical records from June to August 2131?",Patient was started on antibiotics and kept under observation and followed up for hypercholesterolemia.,"The patient was admitted and discharged with antibiotics and then re-admitted for laparoscopic appendectomy, drainage of abscess, and followup oral antibiotics.",Patient underwent partial gastrectomy and gastroduodenostomy.,The patient’s mother was observed for any potential inheritable genetic health conditions.,Patient was immediately put into surgery for appendectomy without antibiotic treatment.,B,"The correct answer is B. The medical records show that in June, the patient was admitted with perforated appendicitis, treated with IV antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, flagyl), and kept NPO with IV fluids. The patient's diet was slowly advanced until she started on regular food. Pain was controlled with morphine, while nausea was controlled with compazine. The patient was discharged on oral antibiotics (Augmentin and Flagyl) to be taken for 3 weeks. In August, the patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy, and her pain was well-controlled. The antibiotics were continued after operation. Answer choice A is incorrect because the patient was admitted for appendicitis, not hypercholesterolemia. C is incorrect because the patient underwent laparascopic appendectomy and drainage of abscess, not gastrectomy and gastroduodenostomy. D is incorrect because there is no evidence of monitoring of the patient's mother. E is incorrect because the patient was indeed treated with antibiotics before her surgical procedure."
93,2,14983081,What was the primary complaint made by the patient during her second hospital visit and what was the undergone procedure to address this issue?,The patient complained about persistent increased blood pressure and underwent labor induction for the second visit.,The patient complained about infection in the surgical wound and was treated through the process of incision and drainage during the second visit.,The patient had complaints related to obesity and underwent Magnesium therapy in the second visit.,The patient presented with blurred vision and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery during her second visit.,The patient reported drainage from the cesarean section incision and was administered vancomycin and clindamycin during her second visit.,B,"In the second discharge summary, the patient's primary complaint was drainage from the incision that led to wound dehiscence. To treat this, she underwent a procedure called incision and drainage (bedside I&D). Option A refers to the patient's first hospital visit, not her second. Option C conflates the history and treatment of the first admission with the conditions of the second admission. Option D refers to symptoms and procedures from the first admission. Option E correctly states the patient's complaint but incorrectly identifies the treatment, which was surgical, not pharmaceutical."
94,2,12545174,Was the patient's abdominal pain before and after the ERCP procedure related to the same issue?,The abdominal pain is related to the allergic rhinitis.,The pain is due to post-operative complications from the laparoscopic port sites.,The abdominal pain is related to the sludge in the bile duct and post ERCP biliary sphincterotomy.,"The abdominal pain is a sign of Hyperlipidemia, a condition noted in the patient's family history.",The abdominal pain is due to post-operative complications from the C-section surgery.,C,"Choice C is correct as, both before and after the ERCP procedure, the patient's abdominal pain is caused by sludging in the bile duct and complications resulting from the ERCP procedure. Abdominal pain was a major symptom before the procedure, then recurred after the procedure. This recurrence was noted even after sludge removal indicating a residual related issue. There is no information to link the abdominal pain to allergic rhinitis (A), laparoscopic port sites (B), Hyperlipidemia (D), and past C-section surgery (E). So these answers, while using information in the discharge summary, are incorrect."
95,2,10528828,What was the medication regimen for managing the patient's type 1 diabetes following her hospitalization due to left lower extremity DVT as per the note charted on 2112-01-27?,The patient was prescribed B Complex-Vitamin C-Folic Acid 1 mg once daily.,Enoxaparin 80mg was given BID via subcutaneous injections.,The patient's insulin regimen was adjusted for better blood glucose control.,Oxycodone-Acetaminophen was administered for pain management.,The patient did not receive any medication for managing the diabetes.,C,"Based on the discharge summary, the patient's insulin regimen was adjusted to improve her blood glucose control, making option C the correct answer. Although options A, B, and D do reflect medications prescribed to the patient upon discharge, these were not specifically for managing her type 1 diabetes (option A is a vitamin supplement, option B is an anticoagulant following her DVT, and option D is for pain management). Hence, these options are not correct. Option E is incorrect as per the discharge medication list, which includes insulin. Hence, it's clear that the patient did receive medication for her diabetes."
96,2,17720379,Did the patient undergo any surgical or invasive procedure during her subsequent visit after being diagnosed with renal hematoma?,The patient didn't undergo any surgical or invasive procedures.,The patient underwent a robotic assisted left laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.,The patient was treated with medications only for renal hematoma.,The patient underwent a surgical procedure to treat her allergies.,The patient had a procedure to treat a urinary tract obstruction.,B,"According to the second note, the patient underwent a ""robotic assisted left laparoscopic partial nephrectomy"". This implies that she did have a surgical procedure during her subsequent visit after being diagnosed with a renal hematoma. However, option A is incorrect because it contradicts the fact that she underwent surgery. Option C is incorrect because there's no mention of medication-only treatment in the provided discharge summary. Option D is incorrect as no treatment for allergies is mentioned. Finally, option E is also incorrect because there is no record of a procedure for urinary tract obstruction. Therefore, option B is the correct choice."
97,2,15657734,"What was the second major surgical procedure that the patient underwent, and why was it necessary?",The patient underwent an Anterior and posterior lumbar instrumentation and fusion L4-S1 due to progressive lower back pain and disc degeneration.,The patient underwent an L4-5 and L5-S1 microdiscectomies to treat L4-5 and L5-S1 herniated discs.,The patient underwent a hysterectomy due to severe back and leg discomfort and sciatica.,The patient underwent a Major surgical procedure - ALIF L4-S1 due to a chronic disc herniation.,The patient underwent a spontaneous vaginal delivery due to severe back and leg discomfort and sciatica.,A,"Option A is correct because the second major surgical procedure that the patient underwent as per the notes is an Anterior and posterior lumbar instrumentation and fusion L4-S1, and this was necessary because the patient was suffering from progressive lower back pain and disc degeneration. Option B is incorrect but a good distractor because it correctly mentions L4-5 and L5-S1 microdiscectomies, but this was the first major procedure the patient underwent not the second one. Option C & E are incorrect because they incorrectly infer that the patient underwent a hysterectomy and a spontaneous vaginal delivery as a result of her back problems, whereas these are part of her past medical history. Option D is partly correct, but it only mentions one of the procedures performed during the second operation, and incomplete."
98,2,12788767,What was the initial treatment given to the patient upon her admission on the second visit for the left foot wound infection?,The patient was treated with QD dressing changes and ingestion of Gabapentin.,The patient was immediately subjected to surgical excision of the wound.,The patient was given therapeutic doses of IV antibiotics along with wound dressing changes.,The patient was prescribed corticosteroids to palliate the symptoms.,The patient was prescribed anti-inflammatory medications along with wound dressing changes.,C,"The note states that upon the patient's admission for left foot wound infection during the second visit, she was started on IV antibiotics and given QD dressing changes, which indicates treatment choice C as the correct answer. Neither Gabapentin nor corticosteroids are mentioned in the treatment notes from the second visit as mentioned in option A and D. The patient was not subjected to surgical excision of the wound in this visit as suggested in option B. Anti-inflammatory medications are not mentioned in the note, which excludes option E."
99,2,13976019,What was the adjustment made to the patient's pain management regimen after the second admission compared to the first admission?,The patient was administered a different form of morphine.,The patient was given Toradol IV during the second admission.,The patient was taken off MS contin in his second admission.,The patient's pain management regimen included both PO and IV Dilaudid during his second admission.,The patient was given acetaminophen in his second admission but not in the first.,D,"The adjustment to the patient's pain management regimen between the first and second admission was the inclusion of both PO (by mouth) and IV (intravenous) Dilaudid. Options A and E are incorrect as morphine (MS contin) and acetaminophen were part of the patient's medication in both admissions. Option B is incorrect because it states that Toradol IV which was instead given during the first admission, not the second. Option C is incorrect because the patient wasn't taken off MS contin during the second admission. Instead, it was added to the regimen in the first admission and was continued in the second admission."
