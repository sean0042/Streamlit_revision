1,1,11350221,What were the substance use habits of the patient and do they have any plans to discontinue substance abuse as per the discharge summary?,The patient had a history of marijuana and heroin use and plans to discontinue without any assistance.,"The patient was found to have a history of tobacco, alcohol, and cocaine use and has expressed interest in enrolling in a treatment program to cease these behaviors.",The patient abused methamphetamine and has already enrolled in a treatment program.,The patient has a history of heavy drinking but has no plans to discontinue it.,"The patient used psychedelic drugs frequently, and while he has previously attempted to stop, he has no current plans to cease usage.",B,"The discharge summary states that the patient has a long-standing history of tobacco, alcohol, and cocaine use, which has posed serious issues in his life. It is also stated that the patient has aforementioned concerns about this and is interested in enrolling in a treatment plan. This information aligns with option B. Options A, C, D, and E all mention other substances that are not mentioned within the patient's history according to the discharge summary, making them incorrect."
2,1,17807085,What was the key physical restriction advised to the patient upon discharge following the fracture of the odontoid process?,The patient was advised to refrain from any physical activities.,The patient was instructed to avoid bending or twisting the neck and lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk.,The patient was advised to strictly follow dietary restrictions.,The patient was told not to expose himself to heavy sunlight.,The patient was told to avoid drinking alcohol.,B,"The discharge summary explicitly mentions two main physical restrictions for the patient following his odontoid fracture: avoiding bending or twisting the neck and not lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk. This information directs us to option B as the correct answer. Options A and C-E are incorrect because they are not mentioned in the discharge document. Despite their incorrectness, they are plausible distractors since they entail common advice or restrictions that might be given to patients under different circumstances or having different conditions."
3,1,16447217,What were the patient's past medical history and the specific injuries observed upon her hospital admission following her fall incident?,The patient had a history of stroke and diabetes and noticeable injuries included a broken right wrist and a fractured hip.,"The patient's medical history is comprised of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, while the observed injuries included bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, a left longitudinal temporal bone fracture, left rib fractures, and a left gluteal artery injury.","Historical ailments for the patient consisted of asthma and kidney disease, where the observed injuries were a dislocated shoulder and twisted ankle.","The patient had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and injuries observed were a broken arm and a concussion.","The patient previously suffered from epilepsy and heart disease, while the noted injuries were fractures to the right clavicle and a deep cut to the leg.",B,"The correct answer is B because it mentions the exact past medical conditions, and injuries as mentioned in the discharge summary of the patient i.e. The patient has a past medical history of Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia and upon admission, the injuries observed were bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, left longitudinal temporal bone fracture, left rib, and clavicle fractures and a left gluteal artery injury. The rest of the options, although mention conditions and injuries found in a hospital setting, are not correct as per the specific patient's discharge summary in question."
4,1,17826767,"What type of surgery did this patient have, and what was the primary complaint that led them to have this procedure?",The patient underwent an appendectomy due to a painful appendix.,The patient had an ACL surgery due to intense joint pain.,The patient underwent a T10-L2 posterior spinal fusion surgery due to persistent back and leg pain.,The patient had a knee replacement surgery due to severe knee pain.,The patient underwent an emergency surgery following a car accident.,C,"The patient's discharge summary indicates that the primary complaint was back and leg pain following a car accident last year. The procedure conducted was a T10-L2 posterior spinal fusion. Although other procedures and events like the appendectomy (Choice A) and the ACL surgery (Choice B) are mentioned in the report, these are part of the patient's past medical history and not related to the current primary complaint. Choices D and E are simply not mentioned in the discharge summary at all, although a car accident is referenced, it did not lead to an emergency surgery but to chronic back and leg pain."
5,1,11616741,Has there been any major surgical or invasive procedure performed on the patient in the past and what was the patient's initial complaint for this admission?,"The patient had a total hip replacement surgery in the past, and their initial complaint was about chest pain.","The patient had a right total knee arthroplasty, and they originally complained of right knee pain.","The patient was treated for hypertension, and their initial complaint was about high blood pressure.","The patient had a gall-bladder removal surgery, and they originally complained of stomach pain.","The patient had cardiac surgery in the past, and their initial complaint was about a severe headache.",B,"The patient's complaint at the time of admission was right knee pain (mentioned under 'Complaint'). The major surgical procedure that the patient underwent was a right total knee arthroplasty as mentioned under 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure'. Rest of the options A, C, D, and E are distractors. They contain information from different sections of the summary but none of them accurately answer the original question as these surgeries and complaints are not described in the discharge summary."
6,1,13562146,What was the initial management for the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and how did it progress during his hospital stay?,"The patient was given 1 liter NS and Narcan for airway protection and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Later, he was given an IVF drip and left AMA.",Hypercarbic respiratory failure was first addressed through endotracheal intubation. The patient was quickly extubated and stabilized well in room air without any further respiratory issues.,The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure was initially managed through administration of a CIWA. No significant change was observed after the intervention.,"The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure was handled initially with a CTH and CT c-spine, and continued monitoring of his status.",Hypercarbic respiratory failure was first treated with a potassium supplement. The patient condition continued to deteriorate and he was forced to leave AMA.,B,"The note reports that the patient was intubated for airway protection and hypercarbic respiratory failure related to severe alcohol intoxication. Soon after, the patient was successfully extubated and had no further respiratory issues on room air. This aligns with choice B. Option A is incorrect because NS and Narcan were given for a different reason, not specifically for managing hypercarbic respiratory failure. Option C is incorrect because a CIWA was used for managing EtOH intoxication, not hypercarbic respiratory failure. Option D is incorrect because a CTH and CT c-spine were used to rule out any acute intracranial process or fracture, not to manage hypercarbic respiratory failure. Option E is incorrect because potassium was mentioned in the context of mild rhabdomyolysis, not hypercarbic respiratory failure."
7,1,16470641,How was the patient's cellulitis condition managed during his hospital stay and what was his recommended treatment plan following discharge?,"The patient's cellulitis was treated with Cephalexin 500mg and acetaminophen 1g during the hospital stay. Upon discharge, he was instructed to restart the home oral diabetic meds.","The patient's cellulitis was initially managed with IV medications including vancomycin, zosyn, and clindamycin. He was discharged with a prescription of PO Cephalexin 500mg Q6H for an additional 7 days to complete the total 10 day antibiotic course, scheduled to follow up with a podiatrist, and advised to continue taking the home oral diabetic meds.",The patient's cellulitis was managed using continuous physical therapy sessions. Follow up care included taking PO Cephalexin 500mg Q6H for an additional 7 days and monitoring of symptoms.,"Treatment during the patient's stay included broad spectrum antibiotics and being monitored for 24 hours following medication administration. At the point of discharge, the patient was advised to use topical antibiotics for the continuing treatment of cellulitis.","The patient's cellulitis was dealt with medication, diet adjustment, and physical therapy. After being discharged, he continued on his regular medication routine with additional pain medication.",B,"During the hospital stay, the patient began with a combination of antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn, and clindamycin) and later narrowed to IV cefazoline, indicating an intensive treatment to manage cellulitis (Option B). Upon discharge, the patient was advised to consume Cephalexin for an additional 7 days to finish a total of 10 days treatment course, schedule an appointment with a podiatrist and continue on oral diabetic medications at home (Option B). Though A, C, D, E propose possible strategies, they either missed information or conveyed inaccuracies relative to the patient's management plan."
8,1,12987930,"What were the temporal changes seen in the patient's EKG readings post accidental ingestion of adderall, and what was the final reported state of the rhythm?","The EKG changes included emergence of a sinus rhythm, consistent ventricular ectopy, and no changes in the R wave progression.","The EKG transitions started with ventricular trigeminy, then persistent ventricular ectopy sans trigeminy, and finally no ventricular premature beats with less apparent poor R wave progression.",Patient experienced transition from ventricular bigeminy to regular sinus rhythm with no ventricular ectopy.,"The EKG readings first showed sinus bradycardia, then transitioning to atrial fibrillation and finally to regular sinus rhythm.","Initially, the patient presented atrial fibrillation, that transformed into ventricular tachycardia, finally normalizing into a regular sinus rhythm.",B,"The patient's EKG showed transition from ventricular trigeminy to persistent ventricular ectopy without trigeminy, ending with no ventricular premature beats with less apparent poor R wave progression. Choice A is incorrect as consistent ventricular ectopy wasn't noted. Choice C is incorrect because the patient didn't experience ventricular bigeminy. Choice D is incorrect because there was no evidence of sinus bradycardia or atrial fibrillation in the EKG readings. Choice E is incorrect as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia were not observed in the patient's EKG."
9,1,18414305,What was the major surgical procedure the patient underwent and what were the indications for the same?,The patient underwent hip replacement surgery because of a fracture caused by a fall.,The patient underwent L2-L4 lumbar decompression surgery due to difficulty in walking and a fall.,The patient underwent heart surgery due to atrial fibrillation.,The patient underwent knee surgery due to chronic pain.,The patient underwent cataract surgery due to loss of vision.,B,"The patient underwent an L2-L4 lumbar decompression surgical procedure. This procedure was performed due to a difficulty in walking and a recent fall causing a reduced ability to walk further, as detailed in the ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure"" and ""History of Present Illness"" sections respectively of the discharge summary. Although options A, C, D, and E might sound plausible, they are incorrect as they do not match the surgical procedure and its indications stated in the provided notes. Therefore, B is the correct answer."
10,1,11544695,What was the cause of the patient's multiple fractures and what surgical interventions were made?,The patient's fractures were due to a skiing accident and surgical interventions included cast application.,The patient's fractures were due to arthritis and surgical interventions included arthroscopy.,"The patient's fractures were due to a car collision, and the surgical interventions included open reduction-internal fixation (ORIF) operations on both tibial plateaus.",The patient's fractures were an outcome of a fall down the stairs and the surgical interventions entailed spinal surgery.,The patient's fractures were due to a motorbike accident and surgical actions involved corrective nose surgery.,C,"The patient's fractures were caused by a motor vehicle collision where a drunk driver hit her. This can be derived from the 'History of Present Illness' section. The surgical interventions included by the patient were open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) operations on the left and right tibial plateaus, as written in the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' and 'Brief Hospital Course' sections. The other options are incorrect as they mention causes and interventions not present in the patient's notes. These distractors might be chosen if an inaccurate reading of the notes was done or if the reader mistakenly related unrelated facts. The provided information in the summary does not detail a skiing or motorbike accident, a fall down the stairs, arthritis, spinal surgery, arthroscopy, cast application, or corrective nose surgery. Therefore, answers A, B, D, and E are incorrect, making 'C' the correct choice."
11,1,15484044,"What surgical procedure was performed on the patient during her stay, and what are her instructions regarding physical therapy post-surgery?",The patient underwent a carpal tunnel release operation and her physical therapy involves weight lifting.,The patient had a C3-4 laminectomy and she was advised to walk for specific durations daily and perform Isometric Extension Exercises in the collar.,The patient underwent a metatarsal fracture repair and she is instructed to go swimming as part of her rehabilitation.,"The patient had a cervical fusion, and recommended physical therapy includes rotational neck exercises.",The patient had surgery for chronic lumbar pain and instructed to abstain from any physical activity.,B,"The summary provides that the patient indeed underwent a C3-4 laminectomy. This rules out options A, C, D, and E which mention different surgeries. Regarding physical therapy, the discharge instructions clearly instruct her to walk for certain time periods and perform Isometric Extension Exercise in the collar. In contrast, options A, C, D, and E either mention incorrect exercises or advise complete avoidance of exercise, none of which is recommended in the discharge instructions."
12,1,12165607,Was the Mitral valve repair carried out successfully and was postoperative heart block resolved?,The mitral valve repair was not successful and the postoperative heart block was not resolved.,"The mitral valve repair was successful, but the postoperative heart block was not resolved.",The mitral valve repair was successful and the postoperative heart block was also resolved.,"The mitral valve repair was not successful, but the postoperative heart block was resolved.",Result of the mitral valve repair and state of the postoperative heart block are not discernible from the notes.,C,"In the discharge summary, it is stated that a mitral valve repair was performed and, post-bypass, there was a well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring, indicating successful repair. The patient developed complete heart block post-surgery but this resolved and he only developed first degree AV block with conversion to persistent atrial fibrillation/flutter. Therefore, the correct answer is C because the mitral valve repair was successful and the postoperative heart block was resolved. The other options are incorrect but plausible answers based on the report and possible patient outcomes."
13,1,10313110,"What was the cause of the patient's severe Hyperglycemia and Dehydration, and how was it managed during her hospital stay?",The patient's dehydration and hyperglycemia was due to discontinuation of medications because of a suddenly contracted illness and was managed by using antibiotics and oral rehydration solutions.,"The patient's condition was caused by a lack of insulin due to not being able to afford her medication after losing her insurance, and was managed with IV fluids, resuming insulin, and LIS and lantus 12u at bedtime.",The patient experienced hyperglycemia and dehydration because she was not taking her insulin due to nutrient deficiency and was treated by a high-protein diet and exercise regime.,"The patient was dehydrated and hyperglycemic due to stress and was treated with counseling, relaxation techniques, and adjustments to her medication.","The patient's severe hyperglycemia and dehydration were due to overuse of alcohol, and it was managed by advising to cease alcohol intake and starting her on detoxification and rehab program.",B,"The patient's severe hyperglycemia and dehydration were due to her inability to take her insulin as she lost her insurance and couldn't afford it (as stated in the 'History of Present Illness' section). She was then treated with IV fluids initially and re-introduced to an Insulin Sliding Scale and lantus 12u at bedtime, which was clearly dissociated in the summary. Option A, C, D, and E are distractions created from information within the note but do not correctly answer the question. These elements include sudden illness, nutrient deficiency, stress, and alcohol use, none of which are mentioned as factors in the patient's dehydration and hyperglycemia."
14,1,15752710,What were the postoperative complications experienced by the patient after the laparoscopic appendectomy and how were they managed?,"The patient suffered from a perforation in the intestine, and a stent was introduced to manage the condition.","The patient experienced symptoms of constipation, and various stool softeners and laxatives were administered.",The patient had postoperative right lower quadrant and pelvic abscesses which were managed by placing two drains.,"The patient exhibited signs of severe abdominal pain, which was managed with pain medication.","The patient had a serious allergic reaction to the antibiotics administered, managed by substituting them with another set of antibiotics.",C,"After the laparoscopic appendectomy, the patient developed right lower quadrant (RLQ) and pelvic abscesses as per the notes provided, making option C the correct answer. To manage these complications, two drains were inserted by the interventional radiology team. Option A is incorrect as there's no mention of an intestinal perforation or the use of a stent. Option B suggests constipation as a post-op complication, but the notes indicate constipation was a result of narcotic medication use, not surgery. Option D states severe abdominal pain as a post-op complication. However, pain is a typical outcome, not a complication per se, and it was managed with prescribed pain medication. Lastly, option E is incorrect because the notes don't mention an allergic reaction to antibiotics."
15,1,12567980,What surgical procedure did the patient undergo during this hospitalization and what was her injury?,The patient underwent a hernia repair due to a trimalleolar ankle fracture.,The patient had an open reduction internal fixation done on her left ankle due to a fracture.,The patient went through radiology treatment for her ankle pain.,The patient underwent a surgical fixation for her right ankle fracture.,The patient had surgical treatment for blistering skin and fracture on her lower limb.,B,"In the provided discharge summary, it is stated that the patient went through a 'Left Ankle Fracture Open Reduction Internal Fixation' as her surgical procedure. The injury that led to this procedure was an ankle fracture specifically referred to a 'trimalleolar ankle fracture pattern'. Hence, option B is the correct answer choice.  As for the other choices, option A is incorrect because even though the patient had a hernia repair in the past, during this particular hospitalization she underwent an ankle surgical procedure. Options C and D are incorrect as they do not correctly identify the specific treatment procedure, location, and nature of injury. Option E is incorrect because even though the patient had a fracture, there was no mention of blistering skin as part of her condition during this hospitalization. All these incorrect options provide relevant distractors as they pick up on various aspects of the patient's medical history and current injury, but incorrectly combine them."
16,1,12111849,"What were the medications given to the patient during her stay at the hospital, and what is the change carried out to the previously administered medication?","The patient's medications were Verapamil SR 240mg daily and Acetaminophen 500 mg tablet every 6 hours, with an increased dosage of Verapamil to 360 mg daily being the change in the regimen.","The patient was administered Tylenol, Ultram and Verapamil, and the Verapamil dosage was reduced upon discharge.",The patient was administered Verapamil SR during her stay at the hospital and Tylenol was added to the regimen upon discharge.,"The patient was administered Tramadol and Verapamil during her stay at the hospital, with Tramadol dosage increased upon discharge.",The patient's medications were changed from Verapamil SR to Acetaminophen upon discharge.,A,"The correct answer choice confirms that Acetaminophen and Verapamil SR are administered to the patient and mentions an increase in the dosage of Verapamil SR from 240mg daily to 360mg daily as the change carried out.  B, C, D and E are all incorrect, but plausible distractors as they all involve medications mentioned in the patient's records. However, B and C fail to mention the increase in Verapamil dosage, D incorrectly mentions an increase in Tramadol dosage, and E incorrectly infers a change from Verapamil to Acetaminophen."
17,1,13499234,"What medical procedures were performed to treat the patient's injuries resulting from a fall, and what were the specific injuries addressed?",The patient's fractured shoulder and elbow were surgically stabilized.,"The patient's distal radius fracture on the left was reduced, and their right ankle fracture-dislocation was treated with initial irrigation and debridement, and later with open reduction internal fixation.",The patient underwent a heart bypass surgery due to injuries sustained during the fall.,The patient's fractured ribs and hip were treated with closed reduction and internal fixation.,A cardiovascular stent was inserted to treat the heart injuries caused by the fall.,B,"The note mentions that surgeries were performed to address an open right bimalleolar ankle fracture and distal radius fracture on the left resulted from a fall. Choice A is incorrect because there is no mention of fractured shoulder and elbow in the patient. Choices C, D and E are incorrect as they refer to cardiac surgery, rib and hip fractures which are not mentioned in the discharge summary. The specific procedures are mentioned as ""closed reduction of right ankle fracture-dislocation"", ""Closed reduction, left distal radius fracture"" and ""Open reduction internal fixation bimalleolar ankle fracture"" among others, which are all part of choice B and thus makes it the correct answer."
18,1,13654724,What was the primary diagnosis for the patient during her hospital stay on 2111-03-09 and what actions were recommended to her upon discharge?,"The primary diagnosis was morphine allergy, and she was advised to avoid contact with allergens.","The patient was diagnosed with abdominal pain, and she was instructed to rest and maintain a healthy diet.","The primary diagnosis was a urinary tract infection, and she was advised to continue with her antibiotics.","Constipation was the primary diagnosis, and she was advised to take Pyridium, Colace, Senna, and Miralax.","The primary diagnosis was endometriosis, and she was advised to see a gynecologist regularly for follow-ups.",D,"In the summarized notes, the primary diagnosis for the patient during her stay was Constipation (Discharge Diagnosis). The diections given upon her discharge included taking Pyridium for pain associated with urination, and Colace, Senna, and Miralax for constipation (Discharge Instructions). The other options, although containing information from the notes, do not correctly address the question; morphine was her allergy (not diagnosis), while abdominal pain and urinary tract infection were parts of her symptoms — not the main diagnosis. Endometriosis is part of her past medical history and not the primary diagnosis during this visit."
19,1,17845556,What symptoms related to her gastrointestinal condition did the patient report during her hospital stay and what was the proposed cause?,"The patient reported high fever, chest pain, and severe coughing. The proposed cause was an unidentified respiratory infection.","The patient reported symptoms of frequent non-liquid stools, abdominal cramping, dry heaves, poor appetite and oral intake, weight loss, fatigue, and occasional chills. The symptoms were believed to be related to a post-infectious irritable bowel disease.",The patient complained of severe headaches and bouts of vertigo during her stay. The apparent cause was unresolved migraines.,"The patient presented with severe chest pain and palpitations, which doctors suggested was due to an underlying heart condition.",The patient expressed discomfort due to a rash and easy bruising. The suspected cause was an allergic reaction to her current medications.,B,"The discharge note mentions that the patient experienced symptoms like frequent non-liquid stools, abdominal cramping, dry heaves, poor appetite and oral intake, weight loss, fatigue, and occasional chills. The doctors associated these symptoms with a post-infectious irritable bowel disease. Option A is incorrect as the patient did not report any respiratory infection symptoms like high fever, chest pain, or coughing. Option C is incorrect as there's no report of the patient suffering from headaches or vertigo during her hospital stay. Option D is invalid, despite the patient experiencing an episode of atypical chest pain, there are no mentions of palpitations and the chest pain was attributed to anxiety, not a heart condition. In option E, the implications of a rash and easy bruising due to an allergic reaction to medications is also false, as there's no such information in the discharge note."
20,1,14825164,What were the indications found in this patient's physical examination and medical history leading to the decision of a bypass surgery for his non-healing left leg ulcer?,The patient displayed instances of chest wall deformities and murmur,Severe disease in the popliteal artery with embolic focus arterially in the anterior tibial artery,The patient experienced constant lower back pain and was a former alcohol user,The patient had a significant family history of systematic diseases,"Patient displayed signs of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema in the right extremity",B,"The correct answer is B. The discharge summary details that the patient's angiogram revealed severe disease in the whole popliteal artery and suspicions of an embolic focus arterially in the anterior tibial artery, which led to the decision for a bypass surgery. All other options are incorrect since they either depict incorrect health conditions (Options A, D, E) or are unrelated to the decision for bypass surgery (Option C). Despite them being from the summary, they don't directly influence the necessity for the surgery in the context of the patient's non-healing left leg ulcer."
21,1,12741711,What were the discharge medications prescribed to the patient after his laparoscopic sigmoid resection procedure?,Imitrex,OxycoDONE,Acetaminophen,Cipro/Flagyl,Sumatriptan Succinate,C,"The discharge medications listed in the note include OxycoDONE, Acetaminophen and Sumatriptan Succinate. Imitrex, or Sumatriptan Succinate, is prescribed for migraines and was already being taken by the patient prior to admission. Acetaminophen and OxycoDONE were prescribed to manage post-surgical pain. Cipro/Flagyl was a medication he had been on before but was not among the medicines prescribed at discharge (Option D), making this an incorrect but plausible distractor. Similarly, Option A is incorrect as Imitrex is simply another name for Sumatriptan Succinate which was prescribed."
22,1,19796586,What conditions was the patient diagnosed with upon their discharge from the hospital following a bicycle accident?,The patient was diagnosed with a concussion and fractures in the left side ribs.,The patient was diagnosed with fractures in the left side ribs and splenic laceration.,The patient was diagnosed with multiple abrasions and fractures in the left side ribs.,"The patient was diagnosed with fractures in the left side ribs, splenic infarction, and possible splenic laceration.","The patient was diagnosed with fractures in the left side ribs, head trauma, and internal bleeding.",D,"The discharge summary reveals that the patient was diagnosed with multiple nondisplaced posterior rib fractures in the left second, third, fifth, and sixth ribs, and splenic infarction vs laceration (Discharge Diagnosis). Other injury findings like abrasions and head trauma were part of the patient's initial presentation but not indicated in the final discharge diagnoses. The patient shows no signs of internal bleeding during the hospital stay and an explicit diagnosis of a concussion or head trauma is also not mentioned in the discharge diagnoses.  Therefore, other options A, B, C, E do contain content found in the notes but do not correctly answer the question are thus distractors."
23,1,19181525,What changes were made to the patient's hypertension (HTN) medication regimen during her hospital stay and why were these changes necessary?,Increased Lisinopril dosage from 20mg to 30mg and Hydrochlorothiazide was stopped to manage sustained blood pressure levels.,Lisinopril dosage was reduced to effectively manage blood pressure and kidney function.,Torsemide was discontinued due to lack of effectiveness in managing blood pressure.,Lisinopril and Torsemide were resumed because blood pressure was too low.,Hydrochlorothiazide and Torsemide dosage was increased for better management of hypertension.,A,"The notes specify that once kidney function improved, the patient's home regimen of Lisinopril and Torsemide was resumed. Considering the consistent high blood pressure, Lisinopril was increased to 30mg daily from 20mg. Moreover, Hydrochlorothiazide was stopped. This indicates that the correct answer is A.   Answer choice B is incorrect because the Lisinopril dosage was not reduced; instead, it was increased.  Option C is wrong because the Torsemide was not discontinued; it was resumed and continued as part of the patient's hypertension medication regimen.  Choice D is incorrect because the blood pressure was not too low; instead, it was consistently high.  Lastly, option E is incorrect as Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued and there was no indication of an increase in Torsemide dosage in the notes."
24,1,17394766,What surgical procedure was performed on the patient and for what diagnosis?,The patient was operated on for a thyroidectomy due to Hypothyroid.,The patient had a C3-C6 laminectomy performed due to 4 levels of cord compression.,The patient had routine neuromonitoring for their neck pain.,The patient was treated with physical therapy for arthritis and gout.,The patient underwent full physical examination upon admission because of a more frequent urination.,B,"The correct answer is B - ""The patient had a C3-C6 laminectomy performed due to 4 levels of cord compression"". This procedure was mentioned in the section labeled 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' and the reason for it was stated in the 'History of Present Illness'. Other options are incorrect, A - 'Thyroidectomy surgery' was mentioned in Past Medical History, not related to this admission; C - Neuromonitoring was part of the surgical procedure, not a standalone treatment; D - Physical therapy was ordered during the recovery phase, it was not the main treatment pursued; and E - More frequent urination was a symptom leading to the surgery, not a diagnosis that led to a physical examination."
25,1,14685845,What was the main cause of the patient's abdominal pain and what was the overall intervention for it?,"The abdominal pain was due to gastroesophageal reflux, and the patient was treated with omeprazole.","The patient had gastritis caused by eating pizza and wine, and he was treated with over-the-counter antacids.","The abdominal pain was caused by appendicitis, and the patient underwent an open appendectomy.","The abdominal pain was due to acute cholecystitis, and the intervention was a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","The patient had irritable bowel syndrome, and he was treated with dietary adjustments.",D,"The provided discharge summary indicates that the patient had ""acute cholecystitis"", which is the inflammation of the gallbladder, a condition likely responsible for his abdominal pain. The patient underwent a ""laparoscopic cholecystectomy"", a surgical procedure to remove the gallbladder. The distractors, although containing elements mentioned in the summary (like gastric reflux, pizza and wine, appendectomy and dietary adjustments), are unrelated to the main cause of the patient's abdominal pain. The incorrect options specifically misinterpret the causes and intervention used. The correct answer, however, synthesizes information from different parts of the discharge summary accurately."
26,1,14562830,What was the patient's hematocrit level at the time of discharge?,The patient's hematocrit level was at HCT 38.,The Patient's hematocrit level at discharge was noted as Hct-31.1.,The hematocrit level in the patient was 30.7 at discharge.,The discharged patient had a Hct level of Hct-31.4.,The patient's hematocrit level at discharge was Hct-34.6.,C,"In the Discharge summary it is mentioned that ""her hematocrit was trended during her hospitalization and remained stable with a nadir of 30.7 on the day of discharge"". This data confirms that the patient's hematocrit level at the time of discharge was 30.7. The other options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they mention different hematocrit levels from the various tests performed during her stay in the hospital but not at the time of discharge, hence they are good distractors."
27,1,15281844,What is the patient's allergy profile and how it might have impacted the patient's treatment during the presented hospital admission?,The patient is allergic to iodinated contrast media and all kinds of antibiotics,"The patient is allergic to various antibiotics, but managed with alternative medications","The patient is allergic to iodinated contrast media, which led to the use of non-iodinated contrast agents for imaging studies","The patient is allergic to iodinated contrast media and multiple antibiotics, which led to the use of different antiviral and non-antibiotic treatment strategies, and alternative contrast agents for imaging studies",The patient is not allergic to any medications or contrast agents,B,"In the given case, the patient is allergic to iodinated contrast media and various antibiotics. However, there is no record in the discharge summary stating that there were any instances where the treatment was altered or any imaging studies were conducted requiring contrast agents during the patient's hospital stay. Hence, it can be inferred that her allergies didn't impact her treatment in this particular hospital admission. Rest of the options are incorrect either because they contain false details (like allergies to all antibiotics, use of antiviral treatments, non-iodinated contrast agents used, no allergies) or they depict that the treatment was impacted by allergies, which has no evidence in the discharge summary."
28,1,16169667,Which medications was the patient prescribed upon discharge and for what medical conditions were these medications intended?,"Methadone for drug addiction, Aripiprazole for mood disorders, Clonazepam for anxiety, and Trihexyphenidyl for side effects of psychotic medications","Alprazolam for anxiety, Abilify for psychotic disorders, Etizolam for insomnia, and Topiramate for epilepsy","Methylphenidate for ADHD, Aripiprazole for psychosis NOS, Clonazepam for anxiety, and Trihexyphenidyl for the side effects of antipsychotic medications","Ritalin for narcolepsy, Abilify for depressive disorder, Clonazepam for seizures, and Trihexyphenidyl for Parkinson's disease","Methylphenidate for sleep apnea, Aripiprazole for schizophrenia, Clonazepam for nervousness, and Trihexyphenidyl for dissociative disorder",C,"The discharge medication list upon discharge includes methylphenidate, aripiprazole, clonazepam, and trihexyphenidyl. Methylphenidate is typically used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), highlighting a key aspect of the patient's medical history. Aripiprazole is often prescribed for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including psychotic disorders, and fits with the patient's discharge diagnosis of psychosis NOS. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine used to alter brain activity and is generally used to reduce anxiety, while trihexyphenidyl is used to treat the side effects of antipsychotic medications. All other options include either the wrong medications or wrong indications for these medicines."
29,1,18426003,What was the most likely cause of the patient's syncope episode?,Syncope episode was due to her Dehydration,Syncope episode was due to her Pulmonary MAC infection,Syncope episode was due to her Diarrhea predominant IBS,Syncope episode was due to her Hypertension,Syncope episode was due to an irregular heartbeat,A,"The discharge summary indicates that the patient was dehydrated, and this was the main cause of her fainting episode. This is mentioned directly in the discharge diagnosis as ""Vasovagal syncope"" which is often brought on by dehydration. An incorrect option, B, states that the cause was her Pulmonary MAC infection; however, this was a separate concern and not directly related to her syncope episode. Option C and D, point to her diarrhea-predominant IBS and Hypertension as a cause of her syncope are incorrect. Even though IBS and Hypertension were part of her medical history, they were not the direct cause of her fainting. E, an irregular heartbeat, is another common reason for fainting, but the discharge summary specifically states ""no obvious arrhythmia pre-disposing waveforms"" in the ECG report, ruling out cardiac causes for her syncope. This makes E a good distractor. Hence, the most likely cause of the patient's syncope episode was Dehydration."
30,1,10996933,"What past medical history was significant for the patient admitted on 2188-04-08 for menorrhagia, likely due to adenomyosis, that contributed to their treatment plan?",Prior experience of severe reaction to Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics),Medical history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE),Historical record of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV),Medical history of three Therapeutic Abortion (TAB),Past medical history of infertility,B,"The patient's medical history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is significant because it prevented the patient from using hormonal management for the treatment of her menorrhagia, hence she chose surgical management. While the patient indeed has a history of allergy to Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) (option A), and HSV (option C), and has had three TAB (option D), and infertility (option E), these were not detailed in the notes as influencing the course of treatment for the menorrhagia due to adenomyosis."
31,1,10203641,"What was the medication regimen for the patient upon discharge, including dosages and frequency?",Prednisone - 10 mg Tablet - one tablet three times a day,"Prelone 15 mg/5 mL Solution - Eight (8) mL PO twice a day, Mesalamine 4 gram/60 mL Enema - One (1) Rectal once a day, and Colazal 750 mg Capsule - one capsule three times a day","Colazal 750 mg Capsule - two capsules twice a day, Hydrocortisone 100 mg/60 mL Enema - two enemas twice a day","Mesalamine 4 gram/60 mL Enema - two enemas twice a day, Prelone 15 mg/5 mL Solution - one teaspoon twice a day","Prednisone 30mg twice a day, Mesalamine 4 gram/60 mL Enema - one enema once a day",B,"Examination of the discharge medications in the summary shows that the patient was prescribed Prelone 15 mg/5 mL Solution - Eight (8) mL PO twice a day, Mesalamine 4 gram/60 mL Enema - One (1) Rectal once a day, and Colazal 750 mg Capsule - one capsule three times a day. There were other medications the patient had been on during hospitalization, such as Prednisone (Option A and E), which might confuse someone who is not reading carefully. The dosages and frequencies in options C and D were fabricated and did not appear in the summary."
32,1,16869974,"Regarding the patient's current condition, what kind of surgical procedure did she undergo and what are the characteristics of the lesion identified in her pancreas?",The patient underwent a hepaticojejunostomy and a pancreatic duct dilation was noted.,"The patient was subjected to a ERCP and stent placement, with the identification of a needy defined mass in the region of the patient's pancreatic head.",A surgery was performed to remove gallbladder and a small amount of sludge was observed in her pancreas.,The patient underwent an abdominal surgery and a small amount of sludge was identified in the pancreas.,The patient went through a gastric bypass surgery and the gallbladder was distended.,B,"The patient did undergo an ERCP and stent placement, as stated in the note's 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section. Moreover, an 'ill-defined mass' was noted in the 'pancreatic head' of the patient, which is mentioned in the 'RUQ Ultrasound' findings. The other options are incorrect as the patient did not undergo hepaticojejunostomy, gallbladder removal, abdominal surgery or gastric bypass surgery, and there is no mention of a 'pancreatic duct dilation' or 'a small amount of sludge' in her pancreas."
33,1,11230090,What was the cause of abdominal trauma that led to the patient's Cesarean delivery and what were the instructions given to the patient concerning future pregnancies?,"The patient experienced abdominal trauma after falling down the stairs, and was instructed to have future pregnancies using in vitro fertilization methods.","Her abdominal trauma was due to a car accident, and she was told to restrict physical activity during future pregnancies.","The patient was assaulted which resulted in abdominal trauma, and was advised to have a cesarean delivery for all future pregnancies after waiting for at least a year, and was given a prescription for birth control pills.","Abdominal trauma resulted from a sports injury, and she was instructed to avoid strenuous activities in future pregnancies.","The trauma was a result of a gunshot injury, and she was instructed to have her next pregnancy only under strict medical supervision.",C,"According to the discharge summary, the patient was assaulted which caused the abdominal trauma and hence the Cesarean delivery. Post delivery, she was instructed that future pregnancies should be through Cesarean delivery, and she should wait at least a year before getting pregnant again. A prescription for birth control pills was given to her. Hence, option C is correct. All the other options are incorrect as they talk about other causes of abdominal trauma like falling down stairs, car accidents, sports injuries, or gunshot injuries, none of which is mentioned in the given summary. Similarly, the instructions concerning future pregnancies given in other options are not in accordance with the instructions mentioned in the summary."
34,1,16987407,What was the patient's treatment and medication regiment at the time of discharge and what was the final diagnosis at the time?,Patient was treated with psychotherapy and was prescribed Lorazepam and Sertraline. The final diagnosis was anxiety disorder.,The treatment included cognitive behavioral therapy and the patient was put on Lorazepam and Zoloft. The patient was diagnosed with depression.,"Patient was treated with group therapy and medication, specifically Sertraline and Propanolol. The final diagnosis was Adjustment disorder with anxiety.",The care plan involved exposure therapy with Ativan and Zoloft as prescribed medications. The diagnosis given was Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).,Patient's treatment was behavioral therapy and they were put on Zoloft. They were diagnosed with panic disorder.,C,"The correct answer is C because as per the provided discharge summary, the patient was treated using medications Sertraline and Propanolol at the time of discharge and was diagnosed with Adjustment disorder with anxiety. Option A is incorrect as Lorazepam was discontinued. Option B is wrong as the patient was diagnosed with Adjustment disorder with anxiety, not depression. Option D is incorrect as the prescribed medication at discharge did not include Ativan and Zoloft and the final diagnosis was not PTSD. Lastly, option E is wrong as the treatment at discharge did not include behavioral therapy or use of only Zoloft and the final diagnosis was not panic disorder."
35,1,14616332,What medications were prescribed to the patient upon discharge and what changes were made to the same from the admission?,"The patient was prescribed docusate sodium, acetaminophen, aspirin, ranitidine HCl, metoprolol tartrate, simvastatin, Lasix, potassium chloride, and hydromorphone upon discharge. The dosage of metoprolol was increased from once a day to thrice a day.","The patient was prescribed simvastatin, aspirin, and docusate sodium upon discharge. There were no changes made to these medications from the admission.","The patient was prescribed metoprolol succinate, Viagra, simvastatin, and aspirin upon discharge. The dosage of metoprolol was increased from once a day to thrice a day.","The patient was prescribed docusate sodium, aspirin, ranitidine HCl, metoprolol succinate, Lasix, Viagra, and potassium chloride upon discharge. There were no changes made to these medications from the admission.","The patient was prescribed acetaminophen, magnesium hydroxide, aspirin, ranitidine HCl, metoprolol tartrate, simvastatin, Lasix, potassium chloride, and hydromorphone upon discharge. The dosage of metoprolol was increased from once a day to twice a day.",A,"Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed docusate sodium, acetaminophen, aspirin, ranitidine HCl, metoprolol tartrate, simvastatin, Lasix, potassium chloride, and hydromorphone as mentioned in the discharge summary. The change made from admission was an increase in the dosage of metoprolol from once daily to thrice daily. Therefore, choice A is the correct answer. B is incorrect because more medications were prescribed upon discharge and changes were made to the medication regime, which it denies. C is incorrect as Viagra was not prescribed upon discharge. D is incorrect because metoprolol succinate was not prescribed upon discharge, and Viagra and potassium chloride were never mentioned on the list of this patient's medications. E is incorrect because the dosage of metoprolol was increased to thrice daily upon discharge, not twice daily."
36,1,10752444,What was the patient's symptoms and medication changes related to her hypertension throughout her hospital stay for preterm labor?,The patient reported vaginal bleeding and was prescribed amoxicillin throughout her stay.,The patient appeared uncomfortable due to frequent contractions and her hypertension was initially managed with labetalol and then switched to ampicillin.,"The patient experienced increased blood pressure and was initially treated with Nifedipine, then switched to Labetalol due to a Nifedipine-related headache.",The patient presented with ruptured membrane and was given sertraline to manage her hypertension.,The patient experienced labor pains and hypertension was handled with a constant dosage of Nifedipine.,C,"The patient's symptoms, from the time she was admitted for preterm labor until discharge, related to her hypertension included a constant elevated blood pressure and a headache. The patient initially had a high blood pressure reading and was given Nifedipine as a treatment. However, she developed a headache, which was likely a side effect of the Nifedipine. As a result, she was switched to Labetalol to manage her blood pressure, which was effective. Other options, such as A, B, D, and E, refer to other aspects of her clinical case, but none of them accurately represent the changing pattern of her symptoms and medication regimen related to her hypertension."
37,1,16968810,"What were the changes made to the patient's medications upon discharge compared to their admission, and what might be the reason for these changes?",Increased dosage of Allopurinol and initiated Diltiazem due to renal management.,Diltiazem and Metoprolol Tartrate were added while Atenolol was removed due to postoperative care and the surgery's cardiac concerns.,"Diltiazem was added, Warfarin was removed due to postoperative cardiovascular issues.","Initiated Metroprolol Tartrate and TraMADOL, but removed Crestor for post-operative pain management.",Novolin was replaced with Nph for improved diabetes control.,B,"From the discharge summary, the patient's medication list upon admission and discharge indicated that Diltiazem and Metoprolol were initiated and Atenolol was discontinued. Diltiazem is primarily used to control arrhythmias, as stated here the patient had difficulty controlling rapid afib post-op, while Metoprolol and Atenolol are both beta blockers but maybe have been switched for better tolerance or effect.  Option A is incorrect as the dosage of Allopurinol was not increased but changed to every other day and it is primarily used for gout and not renal management. Option C is incorrect as Warfarin's usage was continued upon discharge. Option D is not correct as Crestor was not removed and TraMADOL was added primarily for pain management and not post-operative care. Option E is not correct as the Novolin was replaced with NPH but diabetes control is not the main reason for medication changes in this case."
38,1,13030539,What was the birth weight of the patient's twins and what were the results of the fetal heart tracing before birth?,Twin A weighed 675gm and Twin B weighed 890gm. Both had normal fetal heart tracing with no decels.,Twin A weighed 815gm and Twin B weighed 1506gm. The female twin had noticeable decelerations in the fetal heart tracing.,Twin A weighed 1006gm and Twin B weighed 815gm. The fetal heart tracing for both was marked with moderate variability and no decelerations.,Twin A weighed 815gm and Twin B weighed 1006gm. Both twins had abnormal fetal heart tracing with marked decelerations.,Twin A weighed 1500gm and Twin B weighed 1200gm. The twins had normal fetal heart tracing.,C,"The discharge note mentions the estimated fetal weights of Twin A to be 815gm (50%) and Twin B to be 1006g (75%). Also, the fetal heart tracing was noted as moderate variability (mod var), adequate growth for gestational age (AGA), and no decelerations (no decels) for both the twins. The distractors A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they either provide incorrect weights or incorrect fetal heart tracing data as per the information given in the summary."
39,1,15696814,What were the specific fractures sustained by the patient following his motorcycle crash?,Right metacarpal fracture and left radius fracture,"Left distal radius fracture, midshaft radius fracture, and lateral supracondylar humerus fracture, Right distal radius fracture, and scaphoid fracture",Right proximal radius fracture and left distal radius fracture,Left ulnar fracture and right femoral fracture,Left elbow fracture and right distal radius fracture,B,"From the context given in the discharge summary, it is clear that the patient suffered from multiple fractures due to a motorcycle accident. Option B correctly lists all the fractures mentioned in the note. While the patient did have a fracture on the right metacarpal, as mentioned in option A, it did not include all the injuries. Choice C incorrectly identifies the fracture on the right side as a proximal radius fracture, and there were no mentions of an ulnar or femoral fracture as in options D and E. Hence, only B provides a comprehensive and accurate list of all the fractures sustained by the patient in the crash."
40,1,15104800,What invasive procedure was conducted on the patient during this admission?,Insertion of an internal stent within the patient's bladder,Colectomy surgery to treat the patient's Crohn's disease,Ileo-anal pouch procedure for low-grade dysplasia,Total proctectomy based on the patient's history of rectal cancer,Implantation of a right ureteral stent,E,"The correct answer is E, as the discharge summary specifically mentions the invasive procedure conducted was the placement of a right ureteral stent. Choices A, B, C, and D are incorrect. Although the patient has a stent, it is specifically in the right ureter, not the bladder (Choice A). The colectomy (Choice B), ileo-anal pouch (Choice C), and total proctectomy (Choice D) are referenced in the patient's past medical history and not reflective of the procedure undertaken during the documented hospital admission. Despite these choices being incorrect, they serve as feasible distractors as all these procedures are referenced in the discharge summary making them potential answers if one does not discern between past medical history and current admission's intervention."
41,1,10085477,"What was the patient's initial symptomatology, diagnosis and treatment plan during her previous visit for the ulcerative colitis flare?","The patient initially presented with a fever, was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, and was treated with antibiotics.","The patient initially presented with cough, was diagnosed with pneumonia, and was treated with azithromycin.","The patient initially presented with headaches, was diagnosed with migraine, and was treated with sumatriptan.","The patient initially presented with stomach cramps and increased diarrhea, was diagnosed with a flare of ulcerative colitis, and was treated with steroids and other necessary medications.","The patient initially presented with chest pain, was diagnosed with angina, and was treated with nitroglycerin.",D,"Going through the discharge summary, it's evident that the patient initially presented with an increased frequency of diarrhea and abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as a flare-up of ulcerative colitis. The treatment involved intravenous steroids, eventually switching to oral steroids, and other necessary medications. Thus, answer choice D is the correct one. The remaining options A, B, C and E provide conditions and treatments that are not associated with the information in the discharge summary regarding the patient's health conditions, symptoms, and treatments, making them good distractors but incorrect answers."
42,1,19675658,What significant post-procedure complication did the patient encounter after the CT guided biopsy of the left lung mass and how was it managed?,"The patient developed a fever, which was managed by administering ibuprofen.","The patient experienced undue pain at the biopsy site, which was managed with prescribed pain relief medication.","The patient developed hypoxia and a minor pneumothorax, which was managed by placement on a nonrebreather and aspiration of the pneumothorax.","The patient showed signs of infection, which was managed with antibiotics.",The patient developed severe anemia necessitating blood transfusion.,C,"The discharge summary mentions that following the biopsy, the patient developed an expected amount of post-procedure intraparenchymal hemorrhage but also experienced desaturation to 89% signifying hypoxia. The hypoxia was managed by placing the patient on a nonrebreather, which helped increase her oxygen saturation levels. The patient also developed a small pneumothorax following the procedure that was successfully aspirated. Options A, B, D, and E, are all plausible post-procedure complications. However, they are not mentioned in the patient's notes, making them incorrect in this context."
43,1,17260268,"What was the procedure carried out during the patient's hospital visit in relation to the lower back pain, and what was the past medical history of the patient?",The patient underwent a surgical procedure to correct a herniated disc and has a history of hypertension.,The patient had a colonoscopy for lower back pain and has a history of diabetes.,The patient underwent L4-L5 fusion with interbody device and instrumentation and has a history of ADHD and smoking.,The patient was treated with physical therapy for lower back pain and has a history of asthma.,The patient had a hip replacement surgery and the past medical history includes heart disease.,C,"The information regarding the procedure and past medical history is found in the discharge summary. The patient underwent a two-stage L4-L5 fusion with an interbody device and instrumentation for lower back pain. The past medical history includes ADHD and smoking (indicated as 'PMH: smoker, ADHD'). Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect. They include procedures and past medical histories not mentioned in this particular summary, though they might be plausible in other clinical contexts, they're incorrect in relation to this specific patient."
44,1,17254962,What was the primary diagnosis at the patient's discharge as per her visit on 2129-06-25?,The patient was primarily diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.,The patient was primarily diagnosed with a prominent vascular calcification at the left carotid bifurcation.,The patient was primarily diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.,The patient was primarily diagnosed with peripheral vertigo.,The patient was primarily diagnosed with a diet controlled diabetes.,D,"As per the discharge summary, the primary diagnosis of the patient at the time of her discharge was peripheral vertigo, as indicated in the 'Discharge Diagnosis' section. This makes option D the correct answer. Hyperlipidemia (option A) is mentioned in the 'Secondary Diagnosis' section, while the prominent vascular calcification (option B) was a non-acute finding in the CT scan. Rheumatoid arthritis (option C) and diet-controlled diabetes (option E) are part of the patient’s medical history, but they were not the reasons for her hospitalization or the primary condition diagnosed during this specific visit. All these make good distractors as they all appear in the discharge summary but are not the primary diagnosis."
45,1,14670272,What medications were the patient prescribed at discharge to manage her angioedema?,"She was prescribed Paroxetine 20', and birth control pills.",She was prescribed dexamethasone 4 mg IV and 50 of IV Benadryl.,"She was advised to use epi-pen as needed and was prescribed Cetirizine 10 mg twice daily, and PredniSONE 20 mg daily.",She was prescribed solumedrol 125 mg and Benadryl 50 mg.,She was prescribed 1 dose of epinephrine (EpiPEN) 0.3 mg IM ONCE MR1.,C,"Option C is correct because it is stated in the discharge summary section that she was prescribed Cetirizine 10 mg twice daily, PredniSONE 20 mg daily, and given an epi-pen for use as needed, to manage her angioedema after discharge.   Options A and B are incorrect because Paroxetine 20' and birth control are the medications she had been using before admission, not what was given at discharge. Dexamethasone 4 mg IV and 50 of IV Benadryl was given to the patient on arrival at the hospital but not at discharge.   Option D is incorrect because solumedrol 125 mg and Benadryl 50 mg were what the patient took at the time of onset before she was admitted to the hospital.   Option E is incorrect because the epi-pen was given for as needed use in case of another episode of swelling in face, shortness of breath, and hives but it wasn't prescribed as a medication for daily use."
46,1,18648000,What was the surgical procedure performed on the patient's last visit and what were the post-operative instructions given regarding resumption of his pre-admission medications?,"The patient underwent a kidney stone procedure and was advised to continue his regular medication routine, including aspirin and antihypertensive drugs.",The patient underwent a knee surgery and was advised to stop all pre-admission medications until his wound healed completely.,"The patient underwent transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and was told to hold aspirin until seen by his urologist in follow-up and the foley removal, but continue other “prostate shrinking” medications.",The patient underwent a cataract surgery and was advised to stop all pre-admission medications until his next visit to the ophthalmologist.,The patient had a brain scan and was advised to take his medications as prescribed by his neurologist upon discharge.,C,"The patient's discharge summary indicates that he underwent a transurethral resection of his prostate (TURP), making option C the correct choice. Additionally, regarding his pre-admission medications, the patient was instructed to continue all except to hold aspirin until his follow-up visit with the urologist and removal of the foley. Options A, B, D, and E are good distractors as they either reference surgeries that are mentioned in the past medical history or invent treatments not mentioned in the discharge summary; and the medication instructions do not match those given in the discharge summary."
47,1,16675349,What major surgical procedure was undertaken to manage the patient's endometrial cancer?,Total removal of the breast cyst,"Uterine removal, removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, and dissection of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes",Complete disectomy (removal of an intervertebral disc),Invasive brain surgery such as craniotomy,Amputation of a limb,B,"According to the patient's discharge note, it's clear that the patient underwent a major surgical procedure related to her endometrial cancer diagnosis. This procedure included a total robotic hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), bilateral salphingo-oopherectomy (removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes), and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection. Considering the patient's condition and treatment details, the remaining options are disproved:  - There's no mention of any intervention or surgery involving the removal of brain tissues or amputation of any body part (options D & E). - There's no information suggesting that the patient underwent a disectomy, a procedure designed to alleviate pain from a herniated disc (option C). - The removal of the breast cyst does not fit as the relevant procedure to address the patient's endometrial cancer (option A).  Therefore, the only viable answer is option B."
48,1,11712544,What were the findings of the patient's pelvic ultrasound and what was the primary discharge diagnosis?,"The patient has an arteriovenous malformation in the endometrium extending into the fundal myometrium, and a complex cystic lesion in the left ovary. The discharge diagnosis is endometrioma.",The ultrasound revealed no anomalies; the discharge diagnosis was a uterine arteriovenous malformation.,"The patient was found to have a morphine allergy. No anomalies were found on the pelvic ultrasound, and the primary discharge diagnosis was uterine arteriovenous malformation.","The patient has an arteriovenous malformation in the endometrium extending into the fundal myometrium, and a complex cystic lesion in the left ovary. The discharge diagnosis is a uterine arteriovenous malformation.","The ultrasound unveiled a cystic lesion in the right ovary, and the discharge diagnosis is a uterine arteriovenous malformation.",D,"The correct answer is D as it room both major points from the pelvic ultrasound (i.e. the arteriovenous malformation and the cystic lesion in the left ovary) and correctly identifies the primary discharge diagnosis (uterine arteriovenous malformation). Option A is incorrect because the discharge diagnosis is wrongly identified as an endometrioma. Option B is wrong because the ultrasound findings are incorrectly depicted. Option C erroneously includes the patient's allergy as a finding from the ultrasound and also incorrectly portrays the results. Option E incorrectly states that the ultrasound revealed a cystic lesion in the right ovary, when it was actually found in the left ovary."
49,1,12940345,What was the primary diagnosis on discharge for the patient's visit dated 2177-01-19 and what medication was prescribed to him?,The primary diagnosis was arthritis and the patient was prescribed tylenol.,"The primary diagnosis was alcohol abuse and the patient was prescribed Multivitamins, folic acid, and thiamine.",The primary diagnosis was alcohol withdrawal seizure and the patient was prescribed Diazepam and Acetaminophen.,The primary diagnosis was headache and the patient was prescribed a bananna bag.,The primary diagnosis was seizure and the patient was prescribed multivitamins and tylenol.,B,"The correct answer is B because the document states that the primary diagnosis was 'Alcohol withdrawal seizure' and he was prescribed Multivitamins, Folic Acid, and Thiamine. Option A is incorrect because while the patient did have a history of arthritis, it was not the primary diagnosis on discharge. Option C is incorrect because although Diazepam and Acetaminophen were given in the ED, they were not prescribed on discharge. Option D is incorrect because headache was a symptom the patient had, but not a primary diagnosis and a bananna bag was not a medication prescribed on discharge. Option E is incorrect because seizure was the chief complaint, but not the primary diagnosis and multivitamins and Tylenol weren't prescribed together."
50,1,15031885,"What is the patient's medical background and current diagnosis, and how was it managed during his stay in hospital?",The patient has a history of heart surgery and is currently diagnosed with a left hand fracture. The fracture was treated with a cast and pain management medication during the hospital stay.,"The patient has a history of having a cardiac stent placed and is currently diagnosed with a distal third tib-fib fracture on the right side. His treatment during the hospital stay included non-surgical management with a short leg cast, anticoagulation medication, and continuation of home medications, along with care for his pre-existing cellulitis condition.",The patient has a previous medical history of diabetes and is currently diagnosed with a head injury after a motor vehicle accident. He was administered insulin and monitored closely during his hospital course.,The patient is a male with a previous cardiac stent and currently diagnosed with a fracture in the right arm. He was managed with surgical intervention during his hospital stay.,"The patient, a male, has a history of a cardiac stent and is currently diagnosed with a cystic mass on distal forearm. Non-surgical intervention was planned during the hospital stay.",B,"The patient indeed has a medical history involving a cardiac stent, and his current diagnosis is a right distal third tib-fib fracture. His management in the hospital involved non-surgical treatment with a short leg cast, anticoagulation therapy, and the continuation of the patient’s home medications. Other answer choices are incorrect. Option A mentions the wrong body part being fractured. Option C mentions a condition (diabetes) and head injury, both are not mentioned in the discharge summary. Option D incorrectly states that surgical intervention was followed during the hospital stay. Option E incorrectly identifies the cystic mass on the distal forearm as the current diagnosis when it is, in fact, a distal third tib-fib fracture."
51,1,14818825,"What was the primary diagnosis of the patient as indicated in the discharge summary dated 2167-01-23, and what medications were prescribed?","The patient was primarily diagnosed with ADHD, and was prescribed Simvastatin 20mg daily, Trazadone 50mg qHS, and Adderall XR 15mg ___ daily.","The principal diagnosis was Hyperlipidemia and the patient was given Simvastatin 20mg daily, Trazadone 50mg qHS, and Adderall XR 15mg ___ daily.","The patient was primarily diagnosed as suffering from Insomnia, and was prescribed Simvastatin 20mg daily, Trazadone 50mg qHS, and Adderall XR 15mg ___ daily.","The patient's main diagnosis was Angioedema and was prescribed Prednisone 40mg daily, Benadryl 25mg-50mg ___, Allegra 60 mg twice a day, Pepcid 20mg daily, and an Epinephrine Pen for emergency use.","The patient was majorly diagnosed with asthma and was given Simvastatin 20mg daily, Trazadone 50mg qHS, and Adderall XR 15mg ___ daily.",D,"The primary diagnosis for the patient as indicated in the discharge summary was Angioedema, and the prescribed medications included Prednisone 40mg daily, Benadryl 25mg-50mg ___, Allegra 60 mg twice a day, Pepcid 20mg daily, and an Epinephrine Pen for use in emergencies as stated in the discharge summary. Options A, B, C, and E mention other medical issues the patient has (ADHD, Hyperlipidemia and Insomnia) or a family history of (asthma), and the medications listed are those that were being taken 'on admission'. The medications listed in answer D are the new medications given 'on discharge'."
52,1,16158216,What was the patient's past medical history prior to the current admission and what current medication was continued into the discharge phase?,The patient's past medical history included hyperlipidemia and a previous R biceps tendon repair. Rosuvastatin Calcium was continued at discharge.,The patient's past medical history involves a slip and fall at work. The medication OxycoDONE was continued after discharge.,The patient's past medical history includes R radial head replacement. Docusate Sodium was continued after discharge.,"In the past, the patient had a comminuted R radial head and neck fracture, and Acetaminophen was continued after discharge.","The patient's past medical history involved RUE injury after a fall, and Senna was continued after discharge.",A,"The correct answer is A, as indicated in the discharge summary, which mentions hyperlipidemia and a past repair of R biceps tendon as part of the patient's medical history. Moreover, it shows that the patient was instructed to continue taking Rosuvastatin Calcium, which treats high cholesterol and is commonly known by its brand name Crestor, at discharge. Choices B, C, D, and E are incorrect as although the mentioned incidents and medications are part of the patient’s history or discharge medications, they do not answer the question correctly. B and E include incidents from the patient's current history rather than their past medical history, while C, D, and E mention the medications introduced during the hospital stay, not those continued from before admission to after discharge."
53,1,13446949,"What were the symptoms and signs, as described in the discharge summary charted on 2144-12-11, that led to the diagnosis of undifferentiated shock in the patient?",The patient exhibited signs of hypoxia and toxic encephalopathy confirmed by NCCTH.,"The patient appeared tachycardic, hypothermic, hypotensive, and tachypneic upon arrival to the ED, and had a large cardiac silhouette on CXR with cool mottled extremities.","The patient showed symptoms of severe metabolic acidosis, manifested as a decreased pH level and lactic acidosis.","The patient's blood culture exhibited no growth, suggesting absence of microbial infection.","The patient had a high lactate level of 9 upon arrival, confirming septic shock.",B,"The signs leading to the diagnosis of undifferentiated shock in the patient were the symptoms of tachycardia (fast heart rate), hypothermia (low body temperature), hypotension (low blood pressure), and tachypnea (rapid breathing). The patient also had a large cardiac silhouette on CXR and cool mottled extremities, which are consistent with shock.   Option A is incorrect because hypoxia and toxic encephalopathy are also possible signs of different medical conditions and are not specified signs of undifferentiated shock. Option C is incorrect because severe metabolic acidosis and decreased pH levels are consequences of shock rather than leading indicators. Options D and E are incorrect as even though these indicators can suggest sepsis, it doesn't conclude the patient had a septic shock. None of these options directly led to the diagnosis of undifferentiated shock as option B did in the provided discharge summary."
54,1,12291283,"What was the laboratory result about which showed a severe decrease during the patient's first day of hospital stay, and how did it fluctuate throughout the hospital course?",The patient's white blood cell count severely fell on the first day and continued to increase slowly during her stay.,The patient's blood sugar level dropped significantly on her first day and fluctuated erratically throughout her hospital course.,The patient's hematocrit levels plummeted severely on her arrival and gradually increased during her hospitalization.,The patient's Red Blood Cell count decreased drastically leading to an acute decrease in haemoglobin during her first day.,The patient's Anion Gap decreased greatly on the first day and then remained stable throughout the stay.,C,"The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels were 18.3 upon arrival, as indicated in the 'Brief Hospital Course', which is significantly lower than normal. Over her hospital stay, her HCT levels gradually increased to 20.2, 21.9, and 21 after receiving transfusions and treatment, making option C the correct answer. The patient's white blood cell count (option A), Red Blood Cell count (option D), blood sugar level (option B), and Anion Gap (option E) did fluctuate during her hospital course but did not show a ""severe decrease"" as per the question's requirement. Those answer choices are incorrect but are effective distractors given that the patient's laboratory results for these parameters were indeed mentioned in the discharge summary."
55,1,16663621,What are the primary and severe symptoms that led the patient to seek medical attention during her latest visit?,"Issues with medications, such as nausea, vomiting, or lethargy","Changes in hearing, or changes in bowel or bladder control","Sudden onset headache, confusion, and blurry vision","Chronic interstitial cystitis, cervical and lumbar disc disease","Asthma, myofascial pain syndrome, osteopenia",C,"The correct answer derived from the note clearly indicates that the patient experienced a sudden onset headache, associated blurry vision, and confusion as the primary and severe symptoms, which led her to seek medical attention. Option A is not correct because no issues with medications led the patient to seek medical help; this option also appears under 'discharge instructions', indicating conditions to look out for after discharge. Option B, while mentioned in the patient's medical report, wasn't a reason for this particular medical visit and hence, it is not the right answer. Option D and E are incorrect as they refer to the past medical history of the patient, not the symptoms that led to this particular medical visit. However, they serve as good distractors as they are also pulled from the discharge note about the patient's conditions."
56,1,16614757,What were the surgical procedures that the patient underwent for her left tibial plateau fracture and left leg compartment syndrome?,The patient underwent an application of left leg spanning external fixator with fasciotomies and vac application.,The patient underwent a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells.,The patient was tested for Drug Allergies.,The patient underwent a physical therapy session.,"The patient was provided with medications including Acetaminophen, Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth, Docusate Sodium, and more.",A,"The correct answer is A because as per the provided note, the patient did undergo a procedure that involved the application of a spanning external fixator on her left leg along with fasciotomies and vac application. Answer B is incorrect because although the patient did undergo a transfusion, it wasn't a surgical procedure related to her left tibial plateau fracture and left leg compartment syndrome. Answer C is wrong because it relates to patient's drug allergy status, not a surgical procedure. Answer D is incorrect because while the patient did undergo physical therapy, it wasn't a surgical procedure related to her left tibial plateau fracture and left leg compartment syndrome. Answer E is incorrect because these are medications administered to the patient, not surgical procedures related to her condition."
57,1,18727700,What surgical procedure was performed on the patient during the hospital stay following his motorcycle accident and when was this procedure done?,Mechanical aortic valve operation during the later phase of his hospitalization,Operative procedure to fix the left clavicle fracture immediately after the accident,Surgery to repair the comminuted fractures of the left scapula during his hospital stay,Flexible Bronchoscopy procedure was conducted following the detection of left lower lobe collapse during his stay,He underwent correction procedure for left hemopneumothorax soon after being admitted to the hospital,D,"According to the notes, the patient underwent a 'Flexible Bronchoscopy' procedure during the hospital stay. The bronchoscopy was conducted in response to chest x-ray findings which indicated a 'new left lower lobe collapse.' There were no immediate surgical responses to the clavicle or scapula fractures (B and C) as reported. Also, there's no evidence suggesting a mechanical aortic valve operation took place during the patient's hospitalization (A), nor did he undergo a procedure to correct the hemopneumothorax (E). These other choices are incorrect but make good distractors because the terms do appear in the summary, but not in the context of procedures performed."
58,1,13392033,What were the likely causes of the large bleed found in the patient's head CT Scan and what contributed to its development?,The severe hypertension and peptic ulcer disease led to the large bleed in the patient's brain.,Physical exertion while weight lifting caused the large brain bleed.,The large bleed in the patient's brain was caused by his high glucose levels and amyloid angiopathy.,Old cranial injuries and trauma resulted in the large brain bleed found in the patient's CT scan.,Severe hypertension (HTN) and amyloid angiopathy contributed to the large brain bleed.,E,"Within the provided medical documents, it is mentioned that the patient had a history of severe hypertension and amyloid angiopathy was identified from an MRI/MRA, both of which could explain the brain bleeding.   A: Incorrect: While it was noted the patient had hypertension and peptic ulcer disease, the latter wouldn't contribute to the brain bleed. B: Incorrect: Although the patient was found slumped over weights, exertion from weightlifting was not identified as a cause of the bleed. C: Incorrect: While the patient had high glucose levels, this wouldn't directly contribute to a brain bleed. The main factors here are hypertension and amyloid angiopathy. D: Incorrect: This is not correct as there aren't any indications of old cranial injuries and trauma contributing to this event from the notes provided."
59,1,11755238,What were the specific allergies of this patient at the time of her hospital admission on 2113-03-18 where she underwent an EGD for resection of duodenal adenoma?,Allergic to methotrexate and lansoprazole,"Allergic to latex, Motrin, and Penicillins",Allergic to fluticasone-salmeterol,Allergic to tiotropium bromide and folic acid,Allergic to vitamins and denosumab,B,"As per the discharge summary, it is mentioned that the patient is allergic to Penicillins, Motrin, and latex. So, option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect as methotrexate and lansoprazole were part of her medication which indicates that she was not allergic to them. Similarly, options C, D, and E are incorrect because fluticasone-salmeterol, tiotropium bromide, folic acid, vitamins and denosumab were the part of her discharge medication which again implies that she was not allergic to these medicines. Hence, these options are good distractors."
60,1,18141116,What were the main surgical procedures performed for the patient during their stay in the hospital for breast cancer treatment labeled under Admission ID 25724290?,The patient underwent a right mastectomy and lumpectomy.,The patient had a sentinel node biopsy and chemotherapy.,"The patient was subjected to a left mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and immediate left breast reconstruction using a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap.",The patient had a lumpectomy and postoperative physical therapy.,The patient underwent a total radical mastectomy with radiation therapy.,C,"The text explicitly states that the main surgical procedures that were performed include ""Left mastectomy; sentinel node biopsy; immediate left breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator flap."" The other options are incorrect. Options A, D, and E mention procedures like right mastectomy, lumpectomy, and radiation therapy that are not indicated in the notes for this patient. Option B includes chemotherapy which was also not part of the patient's treatment according to the notes."
61,1,14968093,What abnormal findings of the lumbar puncture led to the diagnosis of neurosyphilis in the patient?,High CD4 count,"A CSF glucose level of 34, protein 103, CSF WBC 3, RBC 76",Blood cultures with No Growth To Date (NGTD),Positive RPR titer,Visual changes in left eye for the past 1 month,B,"The question is asking for the abnormal findings of a lumbar puncture (LP) which led to the neurosyphilis diagnosis. Choice B is correct because the listed CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) results are typical findings in neurosyphilis.   Option A is incorrect because a high CD4 count generally indicates a healthy immune system and would not be a direct contributing factor in a diagnosis of neurosyphilis.   Choice C is incorrect because blood cultures with no growth would indicate a lack of bacteria in the blood, not confirming a diagnosis of neurosyphilis.   Choice D can be a distractor because the positive RPR titer indicated the presence of syphilis in the patient, but is it not a result of the Lumbar Puncture which the question is asking for.   Choice E is incorrect because visual changes are symptoms of the disease but are not abnormal findings obtained from a lumbar puncture which led to the diagnosis of neurosyphilis."
62,1,12691348,What were the major surgical procedures performed on the patient during her stay at the hospital?,Platelets and FFP transfusion,Performance of Dilantin and Mannitol infusions,Left craniotomy followed by removal of blood from a hematoma beneath the dural layer,Performance of head Computed Tomography (CT scan),Attending a family discussion regarding patient's condition,C,"The answer can be found in the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section of the discharge summary which mentions ""Left craniotomy and evacuation of subdural hematoma."" This neurosurgical procedure is performed to relieve pressure on the brain caused by a hematoma (blood clot). Option A, transfusion of platelets and FFP, was indeed a component of her treatment but is not regarded as a surgical procedure. Option B involves the administration of medications which again, is not a surgical procedure. Option D, the performing of a head CT scan, is a diagnostic procedure, not a surgical one. Lastly, option E involves having a family meeting for discussing the patient's condition and as such is not a surgical procedure."
63,1,11612751,What were the possible etiologies considered for the patient's pancreatitis during her hospital stay on 2175-01-20?,Overuse of alcohol or certain medications,Strangulation of the pancreas due to abdominal hernia,"Hypertriglyceridemia, gallstones, hypercalcemia, malignant disease, biliary obstruction, PUD, or gastritis",Uncontrolled diabetes leading to pancreatic dysfunction,Genetic predisposition with a familial history of pancreatitis,C,"In the provided notes, several potential causes for the patient's pancreatitis are mentioned: gallstones, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, PUD (peptic ulcer disease), gastritis, constipation, malignancy, and biliary obstruction. This makes option C the correct answer. Option A, although a known cause of pancreatitis, is ruled out as the patient denies heavy etoh (ethanol, or alcohol) use. There is no mention in the notes of Hernia strangulation (B) affecting the pancreas. Similarly, there's no mention in the notes that links the patient's uncontrolled diabetes to pancreatic dysfunction (D). Finally, although genetic predisposition could be a factor in pancreatitis, there is no family history of pancreatitis present in the notes, making option E incorrect. Despite being incorrect, options A, B, D, and E capture potential causes of pancreatitis and hence serve as viable distractors."
64,1,15036919,What was the surgical intervention employed by the doctors to manage the patient's bleeding gastric ulcer that was associated with a large gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor?,Endoscopy coupled with epinephrine injection,Gastric ulcer was left for self-resolution,Gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor was cauterized,Partial gastrectomy was conducted,Anti-acid medication only was applied,D,"The correct answer is D, ""Partial gastrectomy was conducted"". This is seen in the discharge diagnosis where it's mentioned the patient had a partial gastrectomy. It's also stated in the discharge instructions as she underwent an ""excision of mass"".  Option A (""Endoscopy coupled with epinephrine injection"") isn't correct as the endoscopy didn't manage to reach the bleeding ulcer, although epinephrine was injected to achieve partial hemostasis before.   Option B (""Gastric ulcer was left for self-resolution"") is incorrect. The bleeding gastric ulcer associated with the GIST led to surgical intervention.  Option C (""Gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor was cauterized"") is incorrect. The patient's record does not mention that the GIST was cauterized after the diagnosis.   Option E (""Anti-acid medication only was applied"") is incorrect. Although the patient was prescribed Omeprazole for acid reflux, it did not alleviate the GI bleed and the patient required surgical intervention."
65,1,18094988,Was the patient treated with any medication to manage hypertension prior to the hospitalization?,The patient was given Dexusate Sodium for hypertension management.,The patient was prescribed Antivert to treat hypertension.,The patient was consuming Methocarbamol as a hypertension medication.,There were no medications for hypertension in the patient's regimen prior to admission.,Metoprolol Tartrate was being taken by the patient for hypertension control.,E,"The correct answer is E because Metoprolol Tartrate is prescribed to manage hypertension and this medication is listed under the ""Discharge Medications"" section in the patient's record. However, the other options are incorrect because Dexusate Sodium (A) is a stool softener, not an anti-hypertensive drug. Antivert (B) is used to treat vertigo, not hypertension. Methocarbamol (C) is a muscle relaxant, not an anti-hypertensive medication. The statement in option D is incorrect because Metoprolol Tartrate, a medication for managing hypertension, was indeed included in the patient's list of discharge medications."
66,1,10702607,What were the notable developments in the patient's postoperative course following their right hip osteoarthritis surgery?,The patient experienced an increase in their Creatinine levels during their postoperative course.,The patient encountered issues with extreme pain that could not be managed by medication.,The patient developed complications related to their surgical wound healing.,"The patient maintained stable creatinine levels and was encouraged for PO fluid intake, controlled their pain with IV and oral pain medication and their incision was healing well.",The patient experienced severe complications leading to patient's emergency hospital admission.,D,"In the discharge summary, it is noted that the patient's creatinine level remained stable and did not change from the baseline, indicating that their kidney functions were stable following surgery. The summary also states that their pain was managed well with a combination of intravenous and oral medications, and that their surgical incision was healing well without any complications. There is no mention of the patient experiencing unmanageable pain (option B), complications related to wound healing (option C), or severe complications that led to an emergency hospital admission (option E). While it's true that the patient's Creatinine levels were monitored (option A), it's important to note that they remained stable throughout the postoperative period and did not increase, making option D the completely correct answer."
67,1,15444588,What was the suspected cause of the patient's abdominal pain and bloating?,"The patient experienced abdominal pain due to the negative reaction to codeine, tramadol, and guaifenesin to which she is allergic.",The patient's abdominal pain and bloating were attributed to an ectopic pregnancy.,The pain and bloating were provoked by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) suspectedly resulting from the recent IVF procedure.,The pain and bloating were caused by menstruation-related discomforts.,The abdominal pain and bloating related to tubal factor infertility.,C,"The patient underwent an IVF treatment recently and presented with symptoms of pain and bloating, leading to the suspicion of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (Option C). There's no indications in the document about an allergy-related response causing her pain (Option A), an ectopic pregnancy (Option B), menstruation-related discomfort (Option D), or her abdominal pain being linked to her diagnosis of tubal factor infertility directly (Option E). Therefore, these distractors are incorrect."
68,1,11211311,What were the significant complications the patient encountered during the recovery period post operation?,The patient experienced heart rhythm complications.,The patient suffered from an allergic reaction to medications.,The patient developed a fever and erythema at the right vein harvest site.,The patient encountered gastrointestinal distress.,The patient required invasive monitoring due to blood pressure fluctuations.,C,"According to the discharge summary, the patient developed a fever to 103 on Post-Operative Day (POD) 2 and noticeable erythema, warmth at the right vein harvest site by POD 4. These are significant complications during the recovery period post operation. The other options, while valid potential complications from such a surgery, are not mentioned in this patient's particular post-op course. Option A (heart rhythm complications), Option B (allergic reaction to medications), Option D (gastrointestinal distress), and Option E (blood pressure fluctuations requiring invasive monitoring) are incorrect as they were not mentioned as complications in the document. They serve as good distractors because they are potential complications from cardiac surgeries."
69,1,15553530,"What medications were administered for pain management after the patient fell and suffered multiple right-sided rib fractures, and how were they instructed to manage their pain at home upon discharge?",The patient was administered Rocephin and hydroxychloroquine during the entirety of his stay.,The patient was given a dose of Rocephin for assumed tonsillitis with no instruction for home management of pain.,"The patient's pain was treated with acetaminophen, oxycodone, and ibuprofen, and they were directed to use pain medication as ordered at home to avoid pain-induced shallow breathing.","The patient was given oxycodone, Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and Docusate Sodium for pain management, with no home instruction for managing pain.","The patient was managed with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, oxycodone, a lidocaine patch, and Docusate Sodium, and advised to take a stool softener twice a day and consume more fluids and fiber at home.",C,"According to the discharge summary, the patient's pain was managed during hospitalization with three medications: acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and oxycodone (option C). The other medications listed in options A, D, and E were used for other purposes, not for pain management. Rocephin was given for presumed tonsillitis (option B), not for pain, while Docusate Sodium is a stool softener used to counteract the potential side effect of constipation from the pain medications (option E). Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug (option A) used here for the treatment of lupus, not for pain management. The patient was advised to take the pain medication as instructed to keep ahead of the pain, thereby promoting deeper breathing and reducing the risk of pneumonia (option C). The home care instructions in option E are correct but they don't relate specifically to the management of the pain from the rib fractures."
70,1,12372711,"What treatment was the patient given for his probable aspiration pneumonia, right knee effusion, and right proximal finger fracture during his hospital stay, which began on 2152-05-13?",The patient was prescribed nicotine patch and advised to quit smoking,"The patient was provided with a splint for his right hand, treated with Augmentin for pneumonia and given a cane for right knee effusion",The patient was treated with Lisinopril for hypertension and acute bodily pain,The patient was medically managed for their alcohol abuse and cocaine intoxication,The patient was operated on the knee and finger at the hospital during his stay,B,"The correct answer is B, which outlines the treatment given for his probable aspiration pneumonia, right knee effusion, and right proximal finger fracture. Treatment with Augmentin was given for pneumonia, a right ulnar gutter splint was provided for his right hand fracture, and a cane was provided for his right knee effusion.   Option A is incorrect, as the nicotine patch was prescribed for their tobacco use and not related to the treatment of the health issues asked. Option C claim that Lisinopril was used for hypertension and acute bodily pain is wrong because it was only used for the patient's hypertension, not for the other health issues asked in this question. Option D is wrong because, while the patient was counseled about alcohol and drug use, there was not a medication-based treatment for these problems during his stay. Option E is misleading because it inaccurately states that surgery was done during the hospital stay—the patient was given a splint, and future surgery was discussed as an outpatient treatment post-discharge."
71,1,16310463,What were the key results from the patient's pathological tests done during the hospital stay and what treatment was undertaken subsequently?,"The pathology report indicated a malignant carcinoid tumor of the proximal ileum with a large metastatic deposit in the mesenteric lymph node and an isolated metastasis to the left lobe of the liver. The treatment involved the resection of 200 cm of the distal small bowel and R colon, and hepatic metastectomy.",The pathology report revealed a benign tumor in the ileum and a malignant tumor in the liver. The patient was treated with a liver transplant.,"The pathological tests found the presence of a malignant carcinoid tumor, but no signs of metastasis were detected. The patient was treated with chemotherapy.",The pathology test results showed the presence of carcinoid tumor in the left lobe of the liver. The patient underwent liver transplantation as a treatment.,The results of the patient's pathological tests showed a carcinoid tumor of the stomach. The patient was treated with gastric bypass surgery.,A,"The pathology report in the discharge summary confirmed a malignant carcinoid tumor of the proximal ileum with a large metastatic deposit in the mesenteric lymph node and an isolated metastasis to the left lobe of the liver. To treat this, a resection of 200 cm of the distal small bowel and R colon, and hepatic metastectomy was performed. Option B is incorrect because there was no liver transplant involved.  Option C is incorrect because there was indeed a metastasis detected. Option D is incorrect because there was no liver transplant. Option E is incorrect because the tumor was not in the stomach."
72,1,18889781,What was the identified cause of the patient's unresponsiveness and new seizure and how is it being managed?,The patient's unresponsiveness and new seizure were due to increased leukocytosis. He is being treated with a cocktail of antibiotics.,"The unresponsiveness and new seizure were caused by chronic sinusitis. To manage this, nasal decongestants were recommended.",The unresponsiveness and new seizures were due to a tooth injury during self-extubation. Managing this required recommending dental follow-up.,"The cause of the unresponsiveness and new seizure were not defined but lorazepam was found on the patient's person. He is being managed with anti-seizure medications, specifically leviteracetam, and is given instructions for follow-up appointments which includes a repeat EEG.","The patient's unresponsiveness and new seizure were due to asymptomatic bacteriuria. Therefore, he is being managed with appropriate antibiotics.",D,"The medical notes suggest that the exact cause of the patient's unresponsiveness and new seizure could not be definitely determined. However, lorazepam was found on the patient's person, suggesting a potential link. As for the management strategy, he was treated with anti-seizure medications (leviteracetam), and also instructed to follow up for a repeat EEG and with neurology. Options A, B, C, and E are incorrect. High leukocytosis levels (Option A) and bacteriuria (Option E) were indeed noted, but were not linked to the seizures; chronic sinusitis (Option B) was also mentioned but not implicated in the seizures, and the tooth injury (Option C) actually occurred during the patient's recovery from unresponsiveness, not as a root cause. Therefore, they are all good distractors as they pertain to the patient's case but don't correctly answer the question."
73,1,11693262,"What were the most likely causes of the patient's recurrent syncope, and what steps were taken to confirm or rule out these causes?","The most potential causes of syncope were diabetes and hypertension, and patients got an ultrasound, blood pressure test, and heart activity monitoring to rule out these causes.","The patient might have fallen unconscious due to her stressful mental state, and the symptoms were ruled out through discussions with the patient.","Vasovagal responses, valvular heart lesion, autonomic dysfunction from diabetes mellitus type II, orthostasis from osmotic diuresis, and ACEi therapy were assumed as potential causes, and measures like cardiac telemetry monitoring, EKGs, and an echocardiogram were taken to rule them out.","Syncope possibilities included high blood sugar levels, for which she was kept on a HISS, and her metformin and glimepiride medicines were continued.","The doctors presumed the patient's syncope was due to her inability to work, and this got ruled out based on her social history.",C,"Syncope, a temporary loss of consciousness, in this patient was likely due to several interplaying causes such as valvular heart lesions, autonomic dysfunction from diabetes mellitus type II, orthostasis changes from osmotic diuresis, ACEi therapy, or vasovagal responses (option C). To diagnose this, medical examinations such as cardiac telemetry monitoring, EKGs, and echocardiography were carried out, which ruled out certain conditions like valvular dysfunction. All other responses are good distractors but lack comprehensiveness. For instance, options A and D focus on one cause (diabetes or high blood sugar) but fail to mention others. Option B mentions mental stress as a possible cause but doesn't mention other possibilities or the steps taken to rule them out. Similarly, option E explains the patient's syncope due to her inability to work, which is too simplified and vague. It doesn't highlight the critical medical steps and examinations taken to diagnose the issue."
74,1,12996358,What was the patient's condition at the time of discharge post his appendectomy and did he require any special medicinal assistance?,The patient experienced severe abdominal pain and required constant medical supervision.,The patient was discharged in stable condition and was prescribed certain medications for pain management.,The patient needed immediate attention due to his worsened condition and was provided with intravenous fluids.,The patient was provided with immediate release medication before discharge and his condition deteriorated tremendously.,The patient was incapable of independent movement and required medicinal aid alongside additional assistance.,B,"The patient, post his appendectomy, was discharged in a good condition as mentioned in the discharge summary. He retained his normal mental status, alert and interactive consciousness along with independent movement capacity. However, he was also prescribed medicines like Acetaminophen and OxycoDONE for pain management. Thus, option B correctly explains his state and the medicinal assistance he required. Option A is wrong as, despite him initially complaining about abdominal pain, it got better and didn't stay severe. Option C is incorrect because the patient didn't need immediate or constant medical attention at the time of discharge. Similarly, Option D is not right because though he was prescribed medicines before discharge, his condition didn't worsen. Option E is also misleading as he was capable of independent movement at the time of discharge. These options make good distractors as they are based on the patient's initial condition and not on his state at the time of discharge."
75,1,19031350,What was the patient's condition before discharge from the hospital on his last visit?,"The patient was not ambulating and was in pain, requiring intravenous painkillers.","The patient displayed symptoms of Erythema, a skin condition, and major signs of fatigue.",The patient was unable to follow oral instructions.,"The patient was fully alert and oriented, able to walk with support and had his pain managed efficiently with oral pain medications. His sternum incision showed evidence of healthy healing, and he displayed minor signs of 'Edema'.",The patient manifested neurological symptoms and severe respiratory distress.,D,"The patient's condition before discharge was detailed as alert and oriented, able to ambulate with assistance, and his sternal pain was adequately managed with oral analgesics. The sternum incision was healing well, with no erythema or drainage, indicating a good recovery, and he only had Grade 1 edema. All the details are captured in option D. Options A, B, C, and E are incorrect as they inaccurately portray the patient's condition before discharge as mentioned in the discharge summary. However, they have plausible distractors since they involve potential scenarios of postoperative conditions that could arise in a general clinical setting but do not align with this specific patient's case."
76,2,14555473,What major surgical procedures has the patient undergone for his spinal and disc issues according to the discharge summaries?,The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy for his spinal and disc issues.,The patient had anterior/posterior lumbar fusion with instrumentation between L4-S1 for his spinal and disc issues.,A kidney transplant was performed for the patient's spinal and disc issues.,The patient had an appendectomy for his spinal and disc issues.,The patient underwent ACDF procedure from C4-7 for his spinal and disc issues.,B,"The correct answer is B and E as it is specified in the medical records provided, the patient has had two major procedures related to his spinal and disc issues, namely the anterior/posterior lumbar fusion with instrumentation L4-S1 and the anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) from C4-7. This is clearly stated in the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section of the notes from both admissions. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they do not pertain to spinal and disc issues and there is no evidence in the provided medical records that indicate the patient underwent a carotid endarterectomy, kidney transplant, or appendectomy."
77,2,10304636,"What surgical procedures were performed on the patient during the two hospitalizations, and what were the chief complaints?",The patient underwent appendectomy and open cholecystectomy for a pelvic mass and pain in both ankles.,"The patient had exploratory laparotomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, and cystoscopy for pelvic mass, while an open reduction, internal fixation (ORIF) operation was performed for her bilateral ankle fractures.",The patient had appendectomy due to pain in both ankles while cystoscopy was performed to diagnose pelvic mass.,"The patient had a TAHBSO procedure performed to treat a pelvic mass, and a closed reduction for pain in both ankles.",The patient underwent ORIF operation for a pelvic mass and cystoscopy was done to ascertain the cause of pain in both ankles.,B,"In the first note, it was clearly mentioned under 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' that the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, and cystoscopy, which was done because of the chief complaint—pelvic mass. In the second note, it stated under the same section that the patient underwent orif (open reduction, internal fixation) rt ankle fx due to the chief complaint—pain in both ankles. Therefore, option B is correct.  Options A, C, and D are incorrect as the patient did not undergo appendectomy, open cholecystectomy, or TAHBSO during the hospitalizations mentioned in the notes, though they are part of her past surgical history. Also, closed reduction wasn't performed. Option E is incorrect because ORIF was not performed for a pelvic mass, and cystoscopy was not used to determine the cause of ankle pain."
78,2,13722285,What changes were made to the patient's medication regimen between her two admissions and why were they made?,"The patient initially took Atorvastatin and Atenolol, but these were swapped out for Risperidone and Mirtazapine due to medication overdose.",Mirtazapine and Risperidone were discontinued and replaced with Amlodipine and Atorvastatin to control heart rate.,The patient was transitioned from Donepezil and Memantine to Senna and Polyethylene Glycol because of unwanted side effects.,"Initially on Atenolol, the patient switched to Amlodipine because of the risk of bradycardia, also Donepezil and Memantine were resumed after an unintentional overdose.",The prescription was changed from Risperidone and Mirtazapine to Donepezil and Memantine to improve patient's alertness.,D,"During her first hospital stay, the patient had overdosed on her medications, including Atenolol, Donepezil, and Memantine. Because of the risk of bradycardia, Atenolol was replaced with Amlodipine, while Donepezil and Memantine were resumed after monitoring. The contradicting answers A and C are incorrect as Risperidone and Mirtazapine were introduced after the patient's first admission, not before. B is not relevant as Amlodipine and Atorvastatin were not replaced. E is false because Donepezil and Memantine were not started to improve the patient's alertness."
79,2,17043658,What were the primary indications for the second hospital admission and procedure the patient underwent?,The patient underwent a L5-S1 discectomy due to painful seasonal allergies caused by her abnormal Pap smears.,The patient had a second discectomy because she experienced continued left leg pain despite medical management and MRI shows a disc herniation at L L5S1.,The patient was admitted to the hospital due to the unbearable back pain she developed while vacationing.,A severe case of L4-L5 degenerative disease with moderate symmetric bilateral neural foraminal narrowing led to the patient's second hospital admission and procedure.,"The prior medical treatments which included neurontin, oxycodone and naproxen prompted a return to the hospital for a re-do microdiscectomy.",B,"Option B is the correct answer because in the notes it is mentioned the patient still had continued left leg pain despite medical management after her first surgery and that an MRI confirmed a disc herniation at L5-S1 which led to her second admission and microdiscectomy. The other options are incorrect but made good distractors. Option A is incorrect because the patient's surgery was not related to her allergies or abnormal Pap smears. Option C is incorrect because, although the patient experienced discomfort while on vacation, this did not lead to her second surgery. Option D mentions a different disc issue - L4-L5 degenerative disease but the patient was still functional. The admission was not due to L4-L5, but L5-S1 disc herniation. Option E is incorrect because the medications - neurontin, oxycodone and naproxen prescribed during the first hospital visit actually did not prompt a return to the hospital, it was due to the continued pain."
80,2,11771358,What were the changes made in the patient's discharge medications after her second hospital visit due to post-tonsillectomy bleeding?,The patient was prescribed Heparin 5000 Units SC q 8 hours for DVT prophylaxis.,Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet was added for pain control.,Roxicet and Amoxicillin were started as part of the discharge medications.,The patient was prescribed clonazepam 1mg Tablet for anxiety and acetaminophen 500 mg/5 mL for pain along with addition of certain new drugs.,The patient was kept on her previous medication regimen without any changes.,D,"The choices A, B, and C are incorrect as they refer to the medication regimen during the first hospitalization, not the second one. Although B mentions Hydromorphone which was continued even in the second visit, it doesn't account for all the changes made during the second visit. Choice E is incorrect because there were changes in the medication regimen after the second hospital visit. The correct answer is D, because after the second visit, she was discharged with medications that included clonazepam 1mg Tablet for anxiety, acetaminophen 500 mg/5 mL Liquid for pain along with newly added drugs including ondansetron for nausea and Lidocaine viscous for throat pain."
81,2,14215518,"What was the suspected cause of the patient's syncopal episodes during both the hospital visits, based on the discharge summaries charted on 2133-05-06 and 2133-11-04?",Syncope caused by allergic reaction to Fludrocortisone.,"Dehydration, potentially worsened by the patient's position orthostatic tachycardiac syndrome (POTS).",Syncope triggered by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).,Syncope as a side effect of the medication Ritalin taken by the patient.,Syncope resulting from abnormal upper gastrointestinal barium study.,B,"The discharge summary of the patient's hospital visits on 2133-05-06 and 2133-11-04 both mention syncope was likely a result of dehydration possibly worsened by POTS. Option A is incorrect because even though the patient was reported to be allergic to ""Fludrocortisone"", no evidence suggests syncope resulted from its use. The patient does have GERD (option C), but it was not identified as a cause of syncope. Ritalin was indeed a medication for the patient (option D); however, its side effects did not include syncope according to the notes. Lastly, all results from the upper GI barium study (option E) were normal and thus couldn’t have caused the syncope. All these distractors are derived from the notes but are incorrect, making them good decoys."
82,2,16918952,What new medication was included in patient's discharge medication after his visit in January 2157 and why was it included?,Acetaminophen was included to alleviate pain.,Omeprazole was added to reduce stomach acid.,Finasteride was added to treat symptoms associated with BHP.,Docusate Sodium was included to manage constipation.,Atorvastatin was included to control cholesterol.,C,"While all the mentioned medications were part of the patient's medication regime according to the notes, only Finasteride was a new addition in January 2157. From the notes, we understand that the patient has BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia). Finasteride is a medication commonly used to decrease the size of the prostate in men with BPH. Thus option C is correct. The other options are incorrect but good distractors as they all appear in the discharge medication list but were not newly added in January 2157."
83,2,18706433,"What were the key surgical procedures and complications the patient experienced during her first hospital stay, and were there any implications or relation of it during her second hospital visit?","There was a dural tear after the lumbar decompression/fusion performed on the patient during the first hospital visit, but no evidence was presented on the second hospital visit.",The patient had nil surgical procedures or complications during her first hospital visit and there were no implications associated with it in her second hospital visit.,"A subdural hematoma was revealed during the second hospital visit, however, no underlying issues from the first hospital visit contributed to this condition.",The patient underwent a lumbar decompression/fusion during her first hospital visit and suffered from back pain during her second visit.,"The patient experienced mental illness and depression after the first hospital visit, resulting in a fall and sustained injury leading to the second hospital visit.",A,"The patient had a lumbar decompression/fusion during her first hospital stay and had a complication of a small dural tear. However, there were no indications during her second hospital visit that the issues from her first stay had any implications. The remaining answer choices are incorrect. Option B is inaccurate as the patient did have a lumbar decompression/fusion and complications during her first visit. Option C is not correct as the subdural hematoma was not associated with the first hospital visit. Option D is misleading as the records do not indicate the back pain was a direct outcome of the previous surgery. Similarly, option E is incorrect because the notes don't provide any evidence of a direct connection between her mental illness, depression, her fall and her first hospital visit."
84,2,19028321,What were the major surgical or invasive procedures the patient underwent during the two hospital visits?,Excision of a mass in the right scrotum,Gallbladder removal converted from a laparoscopic to an open procedure,Incision and drainage of an abscess on the right scrotum,Daily wound dressing changes after incision and drainage of a scrotal abscess,Anxiety and depression management therapy,B,"In notes 1 and 2, the patient underwent only two procedures: a laparoscopic procedure converted to an open cholecystectomy during the first hospital visit (note 1), and an incision and drainage (I&D) of an abscess in the right scrotum that is not classified as a major surgical procedure during the second visit (note 2). Hence, option B is correct. Options A and C were excluded as no mass was removed during the procedures, and an I&D is not considered a major surgical procedure. Option D pertains to aftercare following the I&D procedure and is not a surgical procedure. Option E has no relevance to the question as it refers to the patient's past medical history."
85,2,12729865,What was the major surgical procedure undergone during the second admission and what were its complications?,Underwent cervical polyp removal and it caused heavy vaginal bleeding.,"The patient had vaginal delivery with complications of postpartum fever, vaginal hemorrhage, and maternal distress.","The patient underwent a scheduled cesarean section, complicated by large endometriotic implant, bladder cystotomy, and extensive adhesions.",The patient had an ankle surgery that led to post-operation blood loss anemia.,She underwent surgery for a low-lying placenta and it resulted in intra-abdominal bleeding and acute anemia.,C,"The second admission note states that the patient underwent a major surgical procedure of scheduled cesarean section that was complicated by large endometriotic implant at the left anterior fundus, bladder with cystotomy, and extensive adhesions. Other possible options A, B, D, and E are taken from the notes but are either related to the different treatment or different conditions or from the past medical history, hence are incorrect. Even though they may sound believable, they are not indicated as the major procedure during the second admission or its complications."
86,2,10936290,What were the surgical interventions the patient had undergone as of her second hospital visit and what were the conditions that necessitated these interventions?,The patient underwent a right middle lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection due to a nodule found on the right middle lobe during the first hospital visit.,A laminectomy at L2-L3 was carried out during the second hospital visit due to lumbar stenosis.,She had a procedure conducted to manage her atrial arrhythmia.,She had a cataract surgery performed during her second hospital visit.,The patient underwent a surgical intervention for detached retina during the second hospital visit.,B,"Based on the notes, option B is the correct answer because the patient went through a laminectomy at the second hospital visit due to the diagnosis of lumbar stenosis. Even though the other options mention procedures the patient went through, they are incorrect because these surgical procedures were not carried out at the second hospital visit. For instance, option A is incorrect since the thoracoscopic right middle lobectomy was performed in the first visit while options C, D and E are also incorrect because they are previous medical procedures detailed in the patient's past medical history."
87,2,18585955,What were the allergy reactions of the patient with a history of lower back pain and right peritonsillar cellulitis noted in their discharge summaries charted on 2162-04-03 and 2163-07-16 respectively?,The patient experienced bouts of nausea and vomiting due to penicillin allergy.,The patient is allergic to penicillin but the document does not provide details on the reactions.,The patient showed symptoms of shortness of breath due to clindamycin allergy.,Allergic reactions included hives and rashes when exposed to penicillin.,The patient had to be administered emergency epinephrine due to an extreme allergic reaction to clindamycin.,B,"The discharge summaries specify that the patient has allergies to penicillins and clindamycin (in the later note) but they do not provide any additional details regarding the nature of reactions for these allergies. Therefore, the best answer is that we know about the allergies but do not have data on the reactions. The other options are incorrect as they specify particular reactions, and those reactions are not mentioned in these particular notes. This makes them reasonable distractors because while they are possibilities for allergic responses, they do not apply to this specific case."
88,2,18895941,What changes were made to the patient's Labetolol dosage during the pregnancy period and why?,The Labetolol dosage was increased to 200mg bid because of stable blood pressure.,The Labetolol dosage was decreased to 100mg bid due to decreased blood pressure.,The Labetolol dosage was increased from 100mg bid to 200mg tid because of elevated blood pressures.,The Labetolol dosage remained same at 100mg bid throughout the pregnancy period.,The Labetolol dosage was decreased to 300mg tid due to improved liver function tests.,C,"Based on the notes, the patient's dosage of Labetolol was initially increased from 100mg bid to 200mg tid as her blood pressure was not stabilizing (note 1). Upon experiencing elevated blood pressures after delivery, her dosage was further escalated to 400mg TID to better control her pressure (note 2). Option A is incorrect as the dosage was increased due to high blood pressure, not stable pressure. B is incorrect as the dosage was never decreased. D is not correct as the dosage was initially 100mg bid but was increased during the course of pregnancy. Option E is incorrect because Labetolol dosage was not adjusted due to liver function tests."
89,2,17113675,"What were the primary presenting complaints of the patient during her two hospital admissions, as per the discharge notes provided?",The patient complained of gastroesophageal reflux disease and neck pain.,The patient complained of cervical spondylosis and nausea.,The patient complained of neck pain and an arm that was radiating pain.,The patient complained of cervical stenosis and nausea.,The patient complained of neck pain and mild dysphagia.,C,"The correct answer is C because, according to the discharge notes, the chief complaints during the two hospital admissions were neck pain and an arm that was radiating pain for the first admission, and cervical stenosis for the second one. However, it is apparent in the two discharge notes that neck pain is the consistent complaint. The other alternatives, although factual, they do not correctly cover the primary complaints across the two admissions. These distractors were chosen because they all occur in the discharge notes, but, they fail to answer the question accurately."
90,2,17097364,What was the Hct value of the patient after blood transfusion following Dilation and Curettage procedure?,The Hct value was 22.7 after the blood transfusion post Dilation and Curettage.,The Hct value was 32.3 after the blood transfusion post Dilation and Curettage.,The Hct value was 23.7 after the blood transfusion post Dilation and Curettage.,The Hct value was 21.6 after the blood transfusion post Dilation and Curettage.,The Hct value was 26.3 after the blood transfusion post Dilation and Curettage.,E,"The discharge summary in note 2 mentions that the patient's Hct decreased to 22.3 after the Dilation and Curettage procedure, and post the blood transfusion, her Hct increased appropriately to 26.3 on post-operative day 1. Other options are incorrect, as they include Hct values at different stages of her treatment but not after the blood transfusion post Dilation and Curettage."
91,2,12347076,What surgical procedures were carried out throughout the patient's treatment for Basal Cell Carcinoma of the scalp?,Vacuum Assisted Closure placement and deep margin excision were performed,Adjacent tissue transfer and full-thickness skin grafting from the patient's right groin to her scalp were done,A gastric reflux test was administered to the patient,Allergy tests were conducted due to the patient's history of Rhinitis,The patient underwent a procedure to treat her recurrent Vasovagal syncope.,A,"The correct answer is a combination of options A and B. Option A is derived from the first note where it is stated that the patient underwent a Mohs procedure, resulting in a scalp defect, followed by excision of the deep margin, and placement of Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC). Option B is from the second note where the patient had the next stage of the reconstruction which involved an adjacent tissue transfer and full-thickness skin graft from her right groin to her scalp. Option C is incorrect as it refers to the patient's past history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and not the surgical procedures done for her scalp condition. Option D is incorrect as allergy tests are not relevant to the treatment of basal cell carcinoma of the scalp. Finally, option E is not correct as the procedures for treating Basal Cell Carcinoma do not include interventions for Vasovagal syncope."
92,2,12954250,Did the patient show any signs of dysphagia or aspiration during her admission on 2147-01-12?,The patient had serious difficulty swallowing and showed signs of aspiration.,"The patient was noted to be choking during meals, indicative of possible dysphagia.",The patient had dysphagia but no symptoms of aspiration were noted.,The examination from Speech and Language Therapy didn't highlight any evidence of dysphagia or aspiration.,The patient's symptoms included uncontrolled coughing leading to dysphagia and aspiration.,D,"In note 2, it's stated that due to the patient's inability to take PO pills possibly due to aspiration problems and dysphagia, the hospital asked Speech and Language Therapy to observe her. The result of this evaluation was negative for dysphagia or aspiration. This indicates that the patient didn't have any signs of such issues during her admission. Options A, B, C, and E are incorrect. Although A, B, and C contain information that could be associated with dysphagia or aspiration (such as difficulty swallowing, choking during meals, and coughing), these issues weren't observed in the patient at the time of her admission. Option E is incorrect as the patient's coughing wasn't connected to aspiration or dysphagia. Furthermore, coughing is a symptom of her pneumonia, not a cause."
93,2,19193553,What was the culture result from the patient's first admission and how were his antibiotics adjusted based on this result?,The culture grew out beta lactamase negative Acetaminophen and antibiotics were switched to methadone and oxycodone.,There was no mention of a culture result on the patient's first admission.,The culture grew out beta lactamase negative Hepatitis C and antibiotics were adjusted to Keflex and Ancef.,The culture was positive for beta lactamase negative Haemophilus influenzae and antibiotics were changed to cefepime and flagyl.,"The culture result showed Staphylococcus aureus, so the antibiotics were adjusted to vancomycin and gentamicin.",D,"During the patient's first admission, the culture result indicated the presence of beta lactamase negative Haemophilus influenzae. Based on this result, the initial antibiotics (vancomycin and unasyn) were adjusted to a regimen of cefepime and flagyl. The other options are incorrect as they either reference incorrect culture results (A, C, E) or incorrectly state that no culture results were available (B)."
94,2,12177719,"Based on the information from the previous discharge summaries, what were the patient's discharge medications following her hospitalization for Group A streptococcal pharyngitis?",Cefuroxime and Imitrex PRN,Clindamycin Palmitate and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen,"Ibuprofen, Levothyroxine Sodium, and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen",Levothyroxine Sodium only,Clindamycin Palmitate only,B,"The correct answer is B: Clindamycin Palmitate and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen. In [note 1], it is clearly stated that after being hospitalized for Group A streptococcal pharyngitis, the patient was discharged with these two medications. Although Clindamycin Palmitate was to be taken four times a day for 10 days, and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed for throat pain for 5 days. The options A, C, D and E, are all incorrect because none of them detail the correct combination of medicines that the patient was discharged with following her hospitalisation for Group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Furthermore, option C is incorrect as it refers to the patient's discharge medications following her hospitalisation for caesarean delivery and gestational hypertension, which is documented in [note 2]."
95,2,17456581,"What was the patient's final diagnosis upon her initial discharge from the hospital, and what treatment was given?",The patient was diagnosed with chronic heartburn and was given antacids.,She was diagnosed with irritation of the stomach and was given antacids.,The patient was diagnosed with acute on chronic cholecystitis and was treated with oral antibiotics.,The patient was diagnosed with acute gastritis and was treated with IV antibiotics.,She was diagnosed with chronic gallstones and was treated with IV fluids.,C,"In the first discharge note, the patient was diagnosed as 'acute on chronic cholecystitis' and the patient was given oral antibiotics namely Cipro and Flagyl as treatment. Answer choice C reflects this. Answer choice A and B are wrong as the patient doesn't have chronic heartburn or stomach irritation. Answer choice D mentioned acute gastritis, but the patient was not diagnosed with acute gastritis and lastly, answer choice E is wrong as the patient was diagnosed with cholecystitis not gallstones, even though gallstones are associated with the condition."
96,2,12657614,What was the diagnosed condition for the patient's hospital admission dated 2185-09-05 and what was the treatment provided?,The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and was placed on Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg.,The patient was admitted for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair due to RTC tear.,The patient was diagnosed with bl breast cancer and was undergoing a lumpectomy on the R and mastectomy on the L.,The patient was admitted due to shoulder pain and treated with Albuterol Inhaler.,The patient was diagnosed with mastitis and was treated with vancomycin and then transitioned to Keflex.,E,"The patient admission dated 2185-09-05 reveals that the patient was diagnosed with mastitis, an inflammation of the breast that can be a result of an infection. The treatment provided consisted of intravenous vancomycin for three days, which was then switched to an oral course of Keflex on discharge. Options A, B, C, and D, while accurate details from the patient's medical history and treatments, do not specifically relate to the event of the patient's hospital admission on the stated date. All the distractors are parts of the patient's medical history but were not the reason for the stated hospital admission."
97,2,11566502,"What were the surgical procedures performed for Patient ID : 11566502's admissions ID : 27128975 and ID : 25018180, and what were the respective discharge diagnoses?","The patient underwent a spinal fusion for admission ID: 27128975 with a discharge diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis.

For admission ID: 25018180, the patient underwent a microdiscectomy with a discharge diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis.",B,"The correct answer is based on the details provided in the discharge summaries for each of the specific admissions. For admission ID: 27128975, the patient had a lumbar decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis. For admission ID: 25018180, the patient had a revision L4/5 diskectomy for a herniated lumbar disc. Answer choice B indicates these exact procedures and discharge diagnoses. The other answer choices are incorrect – they either have the incorrect surgical procedures or discharge diagnoses from the provided discharge summaries even though they contain elements from the summaries."
98,2,19801379,What was the course of treatment prescribed for the patient's pyelonephritis during her first admission and has their been any related issues or complications during her second admission?,The patient was prescribed with po Macrobid and pyridium for the treatment of pyelonephritis. There were no related issues or complications during her second visit.,"The patient started treatment with IV Ceftriaxone and was shifted to oral Keflex, to continue for the rest of her pregnancy. No complications related to pyelonephritis were reported during the second admission.","The patient was treated with antibiotics on her first admission, however she developed an allergic reaction which complicated her second admission.","The patient was prescribed with Ceftriaxone on her first visit. During her second visit, she complained of dysuria leading to an additional diagnosis.","During her first visit, the patient was treated with prenatal vitamins for pyelonephritis. And on the second visit, there were complications due to elevated WBC count.",B,"In the first note, under 'Brief Hospital Course', it's written that the patient who had pyelonephritis was initially treated with IV Ceftriaxone until she was without a fever for over 24 hours. Then she was moved to oral antibiotics (Keflex) to complete 14 days of treatment. After this, Keflex was continued for the rest of her pregnancy for suppression. No issues relating to pyelonephritis were reported during her second hospital admission, described in note 2. Other options (A, C, D, E) are incorrect as they either state the wrong medication, include nonexistent complications or symptoms, or are completely unrelated to the patient's condition or treatment."
99,2,13912209,"What complication led to the patient's readmission, and how was it managed during the hospital stay?","The patient was readmitted due to lumbar pain, and it was managed with dual repair and monitoring.","The patient was readmitted due to a CSF leak and lumbar wound and was treated with I&D of lumbar wound, dural repair, wound monitoring, and antibiotics.","The patient was readmitted due to a reaction to the Sulfa antibiotic, and it was managed by switching the medication to cefepime and meropenem.","The patient was readmitted due to dosage issues with his medication, and was managed by adjusting the medication prescription.",The patient was readmitted due to an issue with his admission ID and was managed by sorting out the administrative confusion.,B,"CSF leak and lumbar wound led to the patient's readmission according to note 2, and it was managed through a combination of surgical intervention (I&D of the lumbar wound, dural repair), monitoring of the wound, and antibiotics. The other options are incorrect as: Option A incorrectly identifies 'lumbar pain' as the reason for readmission; Option C incorrectly suggests allergic reaction as the cause for readmission; Option D incorrectly explains dosage issues as the cause for readmission; and Option E is entirely irrelevant as it points to a completely unrelated administrative issue."
100,2,19779803,What was the patient's discharge medication following her first admission to the hospital after the anaphylactic reaction to iodinated contrast?,Famotidine 20 mg orally twice a day,PredniSONE 20 mg orally once daily,EpiPen (EPINEPHrine) 0.3 mg/0.3 mL injection as needed for allergy symptoms,DiphenhydrAMINE 50 mg orally every six hours as needed for allergies,All of the above,E,"The discharge summary in note 1 clearly indicates that the patient was discharged with the following medications: Famotidine 20 mg, Prednisone 20 mg, EpiPen (Epinephrine) 0.3 mg/0.3 mL, and Diphenhydramine 50 mg, which correlates with answer choices A, B, C, and D. None of the other options on their own sufficiently answer the question, making E: ""All of the above"" the correct answer. Note 2 does not provide any information relevant to the question as it pertains to a different hospital admission."
101,2,18187859,What course of treatment and aftercare instructions were recommended for the patient following the resection and allograft reconstruction of Right Lateral Condyle of Femur for recurrent giant cell tumor?,Patient was advised to leave the wound open to air after removing the dressing.,"As a measure of pain control, the patient was suggested to use a continuous passive motion device, and to follow outpatient physical therapy.",It was recommended that the patient places maximum 25% weight on the right leg.,"Patient was advised to follow up, but no specific instructions relating to wound care or physical therapy were provided.",The patient had to follow non-weight bearing precautions on the right lower extremity and use a hinged knee brace. They were also advised on wound care and specific medication regimen.,E,"Option E is the correct answer as it captures all the treatment and aftercare instructions given after the resection and allograft reconstruction of the Right Lateral Condyle of Femur. A hinged knee brace was to be worn, procedures for wound care were advised and a specific medication regimen was prescribed. While Options B and C mention treatments or advice provided to the patient, they do not cover the complete course of treatment and aftercare. Option A only discusses a part of the wound care procedure following the first surgery but not the main surgical procedure in question. Option D is a distractor since specific instructions regarding wound care, medication, and physical therapy were provided."
102,2,18356090,"Based on the patient's discharge information, what invasive procedures have been performed to address the patient's cervical stenosis and related symptoms and what medication adjustments were made in response to those surgical outcomes?","The patient underwent a C3-C6 laminectomy and infusion. Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H, Gabapentin 300 mg PO TID, and Methocarbamol 750 mg PO QID were prescribed for home use.","The patient underwent a C4/5,C5/6 stenosis and cord edema. Diazepam 5 mg PO BID, Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, and OxyCODONE 5 mg PO Q4H were prescribed for home use.","The patient underwent an MRI of the Tspine. Gabapentin 100 mg PO Q8H, Diazepam 5 mg PO BID, and Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID were prescribed for home use.","The patient underwent both a C4/5,C5/6 stenosis and cord edema and a C3-6 laminectomy and fusion.

Following the surgery, the medications prescribed for home use were indeed Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO Q8H, Gabapentin 100 mg PO Q8H, and OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 5 mg PO Q4H (note 2). The other options are incorrect as they refer to either incorrect surgical procedures, prescriptions which were not a result of the surgical outcomes, or both."
103,2,16474601,What interventions had been in place in the patient's previous pregnancy for the cervix dilation reported at 21 weeks of gestation?,Misoprostol and pitocin were used for labor induction.,Cervical cerclage was placed to manage cervical dilation.,Ultrasound screening was done to check the cervical dilation.,Patient was given albuterol as part of the intervention.,Administration of oral Indocin and IV Kefzol was undertaken.,B,"The correct answer is B, as the patient had a cervical cerclage placed during her previous pregnancy when a cervical dilation was noted at 21 weeks of gestation. This can be inferred from the mention of ""cerclage placement"" in the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section. Option A is incorrect because Misoprostol and pitocin were used for labor induction in a different context and not as an intervention for cervical dilation. Option C is wrong as ultrasound screening was part of the diagnosis, not the intervention. Option D is incorrect because albuterol was used for the patient's asthma, not as an intervention for the cervical dilation. Lastly, Option E is incorrect because oral Indocin and IV Kefzol were used as medications during the hospital stay, not for the specific intervention for the cervical dilation at 21 weeks."
104,2,17986801,What was the patient's diagnosis at discharge after her second visit and what treatment was followed to manage her condition?,The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of bladder rupture and was treated with one capsule of Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for pain management.,"Upon discharge, the patient was diagnosed with a failed trial of labor, and was managed with an urgent Cesarean section.",The patient was diagnosed with intertriginous candidiasis and was suggested to manage the condition with the application of clotrimazole.,"The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of pyelonephritis and was prescribed Keflex capsules, to be taken four times daily for 14 days.",The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of anxiety and her condition was managed with the daily intake of Citalopram tablet.,D,"The second note confirms that the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of pyelonephritis after her second visit (Admission ID : 26051696) and she was prescribed with Keflex capsules, four times daily for 14 days to manage her condition. Option A is incorrect, as Oxycodone-Acetaminophen was prescribed for pain management, not for bladder rupture which is from the first note. Option B is from the first note and involved surgery, not drug treatment. Option C is incorrect as it addresses a secondary condition and treatment from the first note. The last option is incorrect as it discusses the long-term anxiety treatment and not the discharge treatment from the second visit."
105,2,10795237,What medical intervention and management was done on the patient's issue of hemorrhoids and were there any complications following the procedure?,The patient underwent a back surgery due to her chronic back pain.,"The patient was treated for hemorrhoids through internal and external Ferguson closed hemorrhoidectomy. Post-surgery, she had rectal bleeding that was addressed and mitigated.","The patient was prescribed medications for her hemorrhoids, the bleeding was monitored closely, and she was discharged immediately.",The patient had a microdiscectomy for her hemorrhoid condition with no post-surgery complications reported.,"The patient's hemorrhoid condition was resolved through lifestyle changes and rest, with no surgical intervention deemed necessary.",B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient did undergo surgery for her hemorrhoids (an internal and external Ferguson closed hemorrhoidectomy). Post-operation, she experienced rectal bleeding, but the issue was addressed and the bleeding stopped - she was monitored overnight for any further complications. All other options either refer to incorrect processes for the treatment or misread the post-operation events. Specifically, options A and D refer to removal of a herniated disc in the lower back (microdiscectomy) and not the hemorrhoidectomy; C is wrong as surgery was undertaken; and E is incorrect as surgical intervention was needed."
106,2,19498038,"What acute complications, if any, did the patient encounter during his postoperative course of transurethral resection prostate operation as per the discharge summary on 2130-07-14?",The patient had a severe abdominal pain postoperatively.,The patient experienced vomiting post-operation.,There were no acute complications during the patient's postoperative course.,The patient had elevated prostate-specific antigen levels after the procedure.,The patient had an acute allergic reaction post-surgery.,C,"According to the discharge summary on 2130-07-14, the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, indicating that there were no acute complications following the transurethral resection prostate operation (Option C). The other options are not correct because: Option A - Severe abdominal pain isn't mentioned in the discharge summary; Option B - There's no mention of vomiting; Option D - Elevated prostate-specific antigen level isn't stated as a postoperative complication, it's part of the chief complaint; Option E - No acute allergic reactions are indicated in the summary, the patient is recorded as having no known allergies or adverse drug reactions."
107,2,10172278,What are the surgical procedures associated with the patient's obstetrics/gynecology history from the two discharge summaries?,Operative procedure on both her knees,Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,Ankle surgery,Chondroplasty of lateral femoral condyle,Appendectomy,B,"The correct answer is 'B: Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy'. This procedure, along with 'Total laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophrectomy, cystoscopy', is mentioned in the second note as a major surgical procedure under OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY. The surgical procedures in note 1 are about orthopedic surgeries mainly related to her knees, with appendectomy not being related to OB/GYN history. Hence, 'Operative procedure on both her knees' (A) and 'Chondroplasty of lateral femoral condyle' (D) are not correct. Choice 'C: Ankle surgery' is incorrect as there is no mention of any ankle surgery in the notes and ""E: Appendectomy"" is incorrect since it is not relevant to the gynecologic or obstetric history of the patient."
108,2,10897367,What was the patient's liver function tests results at the day of discharge after his surgery which happened around 2119-11-11?,The tests showed a high level of bilirubin at 1.4,"The results indicated an ALT of 49, AST of 51, Alk Phos of 207, and T Bili of 0.4",The tests showed no signs of encephalopathy and normal synthetic function,The test results indicated a glucose level of 106 and Creatinine of 0.8,The liver function tests showed AST 204 and ALT 138,B,"The question asks about the specific result of the liver function tests (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, and T Bili) at the day of discharge after the patient's surgery. As per [note 2], choice B: ""The results indicated an ALT of 49, AST of 51, Alk Phos of 207, and T Bili of 0.4"" correctly provides this information. All the other options are good distractors:  - Option A is incorrect because the high level of bilirubin occurred on POD 2, not at the day of discharge. - Option C is incorrect; even though this information is true, it does not specify the exact figures of the test results as asked in the question. - Options D and E are incorrect because the figures provided correspond to the patient's lab results at different times and not specific to the liver function test at the day of discharge."
109,2,13162562,What are the surgical and invasive procedures performed on the patient during his two hospital admissions as documented in the discharge summaries dated 2143-07-15 and 2143-07-29?,Nephrectomy and Ureteral Stent Placement,"Cystoscopy, Bilateral Retrograde Pyelogram, and Bilateral Ureteral Stent Placement",Lithotripsy and Ureteroscopy,"Ureteroscopy, Laser Lithotripsy, and Bilateral Ureteral Stent Exchange",Cystoscopy and Ureteral Stent Exchange,D,"On the patient's first hospital admission on 2143-07-15, the patient underwent a cystoscopy, bilateral retrograde pyelogram, and bilateral ureteral stent placement as mentioned in note 1, which makes option B correct. On the second admission dated 2143-07-29, the patient underwent ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy, and bilateral ureteral stent exchange according to note 2, making option D also correct. As a result, options A, C, and E are incorrect. Option A mentioned nephrectomy was not documented in any of the discharge notes. Option C did not completely capture the procedures as it left out stent placement and laser lithotripsy. Option E is also incorrect because the patient did not undergo just a cystoscopy and ureteral stent exchange."
110,2,11244826,"What were the medical interventions the patient received during his hospital stays, and what main conditions led to these interventions?",The patient got a lumbar laminectomy due to a basaloid lesion of probable salivary gland origin.,The patient underwent a parotidectomy and neck dissection because of squamous cell carcinoma metastasized to the submental region and a parotid lesion.,The patient had a release surgery due to hypertension.,The patient received acetaminophen 325mg for managing hypercholesterolemia.,The patient had a lumbar laminectomy for hypercholesterolemia treatment.,B,"In note 1, it was stated that a patient had a procedure of a superficial parotidectomy, and bilateral neck dissection because he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the submental region. Additionally, he had a right parotid lesion which was identified as a basaloid lesion of probable salivary gland origin. The rest of the options are incorrect. Option A misidentifies the cause of lumbar laminectomy, which was actually due to lumbar stenosis (note 2). In option C, the release surgery is incorrect as it should be Lumbar laminectomy due to lumbar stenosis, not due to hypertension. Options D and E are wrong, as the patient received acetaminophen for pain relief, not for managing hypercholesterolemia, and a lumbar laminectomy was done for lumbar spinal stenosis, not hypercholesterolemia."
111,2,19212660,"What was the main chief complaint that led to the patient's hospital admission during his second hospital stay on May 16, 2169, and what major surgical procedure was performed to address this issue?","The patient was admitted due to progressive right hip pain, and a right total hip replacement was performed.","The patient was admitted due to osteoarthritis, and an exploratory laparotomy was performed.","The patient was admitted due to a small bowel obstruction, and an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions was carried out.","The patient was admitted due to persistent nausea and vomiting, and a hernia repair was performed.","The patient was admitted due to abdominal distention and discomfort, and a right-sided hernia repair was done.",C,"According to the second medical note, the patient was admitted on May 16, 2169, due to a small bowel obstruction. The surgical procedure performed to address this issue was an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions. Choice A is incorrect because it pertains to the first hospital stay and not the second. Choices B, D, and E are incorrect; while these statements mention symptoms or procedures that were mentioned in the provided information, they do not accurately represent the patient's chief complaint or the primary surgery performed during the second hospital stay."
112,2,18224726,What were the changes made in the discharge medications during the patient's first and second visits and what were the reasons behind it?,"During the first visit, the patient was prescribed Vicodin, but it was switched to Valium during the second visit. The change was made due to persistent back pain.",Hydrochlorothiazide was stopped during the second visit due to side effects.,Oxycodone-acetaminophen was replaced with Dilaudid during the second visit because the previous medication was unable to adequately control the patient's pain.,Citalopram was discontinued during the second visit due to ineffective response.,The patient was prescribed Docusate Sodium in both visits with no changes.,C,"In the first visit, Oxycodone-acetaminophen was prescribed for pain. However, in the second visit, the patient was discharged with Dilaudid for pain control. The report from the second visit advised not to take Vicodin while on Dilaudid, indicating that Oxycodone-acetaminophen was ineffective in controlling the patient's pain, necessitating a switch in medication.  In case of choice A, Valium was indeed prescribed during the second visit, but Vicodin was not a part of the discharge medication in the first visit, making it incorrect. B, D, and E are incorrect as the medications mentioned i.e., Hydrochlorothiazide, Citalopram, and Docusate Sodium, were not changed between the two visits."
113,2,10096109,What was the first episode that this patient presented with and how was it managed in the hospital?,The patient presented with a rash which was managed with the application of Triamcinolone Acetonide ointment.,The patient was admitted due to a small bowel obstruction episode that was managed conservatively with placement of an NGT and providing IVF until the ostomy output normalized.,The patient was admitted to the hospital for an increase in frequency of obstruction episodes and was treated with medications including Escitalopram Oxalate and Lisinopril.,"The patient was admitted with abdominal pain as a result of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which was managed with Humira.","The patient was admitted for severe abdominal pain due to Crohn's disease, and was treated with Escitalopram Oxalate and Lisinopril.",B,"The first episode that the patient presented with was a small bowel obstruction symptom as evident in the first note. The patient came into the hospital due to abdominal pain and was diagnosed with bowel obstruction. She was treated conservatively through the placement of an NGT, which is a nasogastric tube. The patient was kept NPO (Nothing by Mouth) and provided with intravenous fluids until her ostomy started to produce output, indicating that the obstruction was resolving. Once the output from the NGT decreased, the NGT was removed and the patient was discharged tolerating a regular diet and able to move around without assistance. In the other answer options, C and E are incorrect because, although Escitalopram Oxalate and Lisinopril are mentioned in the medicines, these were neither the presenting episode nor the medications used for treating the patient's primary problem. Furthermore, Answer choice A refers to the second admission's chief complaint, not the first episode. Answer choice D combines information from both notes and misconstrues the timing and causation of the abdominal pain, as the indication for Humira was for the patient's Crohn's disease, not leukocytoclastic vasculitis."
114,2,10427545,"What was the patient's condition and treatment plan after her second hospital admission, related to childbirth, based on the discharge summary charted on 2133-11-12?",The patient was treated for primary hyperparathyroidism with parathyroidectomy.,The patient was discharged after having a natural vaginal birth of twins and treatment for separated pubic symphysis.,The patient was admitted after suffering from kidney stones.,The patient had a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit at discharge.,The patient was admitted due to symptoms of chest pain and pressure.,B,"In the second note, the patient was discharged after a spontaneous vaginal birth of twins and was treated for separated pubic symphysis (a pregnancy-related condition). This matches the question about her second hospital admission related to childbirth. Option A pertains to her first hospitalization, not the second one related to childbirth. Option C is incorrect because the kidney stones were part of her prior medical history and not connected to her childbirth-related hospitalization. Options D and E are incorrect; they are general discharge instructions not specifically relevant to this patient's condition."
115,2,17224704,"What was the level of leukocytosis the patient presented with during her first admission, and was there a corresponding inflammation reported?",The patient presented with a WBC count of 5.20 and no reported inflammation.,The patient presented with a mild leukocytosis level of 16.7 and evidence of active inflammatory changes due to a Crohn's flare was suspected.,The patient presented with a mild leukocytosis of 13 with No active inflammatory changes reported.,The patient presented with a leukocytosis level of 16.7 without any reported inflammation.,The patient had a leukocytosis level of 12 and no reported inflammation.,C,"According to the discharge summary, the patient exhibited mild leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 13. No active inflammatory changes were identified, indicating that the patient did not have an inflammation corresponding to leukocytosis. This eliminates option B. Options A, D, and E are incorrect as they state the wrong WBC count."
116,2,19151069,"What was the patient's final diagnosis during their admission on 2147-04-26, and what was determined about the patient's state thereafter?",The patient was diagnosed with depression and had several suicide attempts.,The patient was identified with drug abuse.,"The patient was determined to have severe anoxia after a suicide attempt and hanging, and was then declared as brain dead.",The patient was found to be allergic to Vicodin.,The patient was diagnosed with severe cerebral edema and was given steroids.,C,"The patient's final diagnosis was indeed ""Severe anoxia secondary to suicide attempt and hanging,"" as stated explicitly in the discharge summary, which matches with option C. Later, the patient was confirmed brain dead, and organ donation was initiated, referring to the second half of the question about the patient's state.   Option A and B discuss aspects of the patient's past medical history rather than the final diagnosis during the admission in question. Option D referrers to an allergy but not the final diagnosis, while option E refers to a part of the patient's treatment, but it doesn't talk about the final diagnosis or patient's condition thereafter. Thus, all the incorrect options are based on information found in the patient's records, making them good distractors."
117,2,17462811,What was the medical procedure done on the patient during his first and second admissions?,Underwent a left L4-L5 arthrodesis during the first admission and L4/5 microdiscectomy during the second admission,Underwent two steroid injections during the first admission and a lumbar spine surgery during the second admission,Received a lumbar x-ray during the first admission and appendectomy during the second admission,"Underwent a left L4/5 microdiscectomy during the first admission and a recurrent L4-L5 microdiskectomy, and fusion L4-L5 during the second admission",Was administered aspirin and dilaudid during the first admission and underwent tonsillectomy during the second admission,D,"The notes clearly state that during the first admission, the patient underwent a ""left L4/5 microdiscectomy"" and on the second admission, the patient underwent a ""Left L4-L5 microdiskectomy for recurrent disk herniation, arthrodesis L4-L5, fusion L4-L5."" However, choice A has the procedures in the incorrect order, choice B incorrectly identifies steroid injections and lumbar spine surgery as the procedures, choice C incorrectly identifies lumbar x-ray and appendectomy as the procedures, and choice E incorrectly identifies medication administration and tonsillectomy as the procedures. Therefore, only option D is correct and aligned with the information provided in the discharge summary notes."
118,2,17760552,What were the postoperative complications experienced by the patient after the discectomy and how were they managed?,The patient experienced severe back pain that was managed with pain Medications.,"The patient suffered from constipation, which was managed by the increased intake of fluids and fiber.",The patient experienced urinary retention which was managed by readjusting the foley catheter.,"The patient had a bout of infection, managed with antibiotics.","The patient felt a loss of sensation in the legs, managed with nerve stimulation therapy.",C,"In note 2, it was reported that the patient suffered from urinary retention after the discectomy. This was managed by readjusting the foley catheter and outpatient follow-up with urology. The patient did experience constipation (Option B) but it was managed independently and is therefore not a valid choice. The back pain (Option A) is part of the initial complaint and not a postoperative complication. Statements about infection (Option D) and loss of sensation in the legs (Option E) were never mentioned in the notes, making them incorrect answer choices."
119,2,17829667,"What were the patient's symptoms prior to being diagnosed with a wound abscess, and what treatment was provided?",The patient was experiencing vaginal bleeding and received betamethasone treatment.,"The patient presented with contractions and abdominal pain, and was instructed to follow a strict diet and exercise regimen after a c-section.","The patient was dealing with persistent nausea, abdominal pain, and contractions, and underwent cesarean section followed by drainage and cleansing of the abscess.","The patient had a threatening preterm labor, and was put under observation with fluid balance management.","The patient was complaining of a headache and impaired vision, and was treated with antibiotics.",C,"The patient did have identical symptoms cited in the options A,D, and E prior to the second admission as per note 1, however, these are unrelated to the wound abscess which happened during the second admission, thus making them incorrect. While a cesarean section (C-section) is mentioned in option B, the treatment mentioned - diet and exercise regimen - does not align with the provided notes, making it incorrect. The correct answer is C because it correctly lists the symptoms the patient was experiencing prior to being diagnosed with a wound abscess (persistent nausea, abdominal pain, and contractions as per note 1) and the treatment that was provided (i.e., cesarean section followed by drainage and cleansing of the abscess, and antibiotic treatment with Clindamycin as per note 2)."
120,2,16410572,What is the major clinical issue from the patient's first pregnancy and what are the significant findings from her second admission?,"The patient experienced hyperemesis gravidarum and severe anemia during her first pregnancy, while obesity and high white blood cell count were noted in the second hospitalization.","From her first pregnancy, severe stomach cramps were the main issue, and her second admission showed chronic hypertension.","The patient had hyperemesis gravidarum and severe anemia during her first pregnancy, and in her second admission, lack of weight gain and low potassium levels were recorded.","The patient's first pregnancy was marked by severe hypertension, while the second admission saw unexpalined tachycardia.","During the first pregnancy, ovarian cyst and other gynecologic issues were the main problems, the second hospitalization revealed normal anemia.",C,"In the first pregnancy, the major issue as given in the discharge summary was hyperemesis gravidarum and severe anemia. Answer choice C correctly states these issues. In her second hospital admission, she was admitted due to poor weight gain and low potassium levels. Although the other answer choices contain elements that were reported in the discharge summary, they are not the answers to the doctor's question as those symptoms and conditions were either irrelevant to the pregnancies or not the major issues during the hospitalizations. A single element from the notes was taken out of context to create the incorrect options, making them plausible, yet incorrect choices. For example, while the first pregnancy did involve difficulties related to the hyperemesis gravidarum, there is no indication of obesity or high white blood cell count during the second admission (Answer A), making it incorrect."
121,2,15803468,What was the outcome of the revision orif (open reduction internal fixation) procedure performed on the patient's left patellar fx (fracture) during the second hospital stay?,"The revision procedure was unsuccessful, and the patient remained in hospital for further treatment.","The patient was stable after the procedure, but the fracture remains unhealed.","The procedure was a success, but the patient developed complications postoperatively.","The patient underwent the procedure without complications, showing good progress towards recovery.",The patient refused to proceed with the revision procedure.,D,"In the provided discharge summary from the second hospital stay, it is stated that the patient underwent a revision orif of her left patella without complications, and was doing well with weight-bearing as tolerated. This corresponds to answer choice D, hence it is the correct answer.   Answer choices A and B are incorrect. According to the notes, there was no mention of the procedure being unsuccessful, or the patient staying in the hospital for further treatment, or that the fracture remained unhealed. Option C is incorrect as the notes do not mention any postoperative complications. Option E is also incorrect. The patient did not refuse the procedure; in fact, it was carried out successfully."
122,2,14188013,What was the change in the patient's discharge medications between the first and second discharge summary?,There was an addition of the medication Keflex for pain management.,The patient was given Lisinopril for hypertension in the second discharge summary.,"In the second discharge, the patient was discharged with a prescription for IV cefazolin.",Bactrim DS was added in the second discharge summary for managing patient's infection.,The patient was prescribed Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen in the second discharge summary.,D,"The patient's medication list changed between the two discharges: in note 1, the patient was discharged with Oxycodone, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, and Keflex. However, in note 2, the patient was discharged with Lisinopril, Bactrim DS, Vicodin, Iodoform, Gauze Pad 4 X 4, and Kerlix. The biggest change in medication pertains to the management of infection; Bactrim DS is added. Therefore, choice B is incorrect as Lisinopril pertains to the management of hypertension and not a change. Choice A and C are incorrect as Keflex and IV cefazolin were prescribed in the first discharge summary, not the second. Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen was prescribed in the first summary, not the second, making choice E wrong."
123,2,10480415,What was the primary reason for the second admission of the patient and what procedures were undertaken during the hospital stay?,The patient was admitted for the second time due to submental abscess and underwent a submental abscess incision and drainage procedure.,The second admission was due to infected thyroglossal duct cyst and underwent infected thyroglossal duct cyst excision.,The patient was admitted again due to a sore throat and was treated with antibiotics.,The patient was readmitted for submental swelling and went through an incision and drainage procedure.,The patient was readmitted due to ongoing neck pain and underwent a CT scan.,B,"The correct answer is B as the notes mention that during the second admission the primary complaint was an ""infected thyroglossal duct cyst"" for which the patient underwent a ""thyroglossal duct cyst excision"". Choice A is incorrect as it relates to the first admission, not the second one. Similarly, Choices C, D and E are incorrect as they do not accurately represent the main reason for the second admission or the procedures carried out during the second hospital stay. However, they all contain details that were a part of the patient's symptoms or procedures in the first and second admission, thus making them plausible distractors."
124,2,13130708,What is the patient's progress in terms of ambulation and weight bearing on the left lower extremity by the time of his second discharge?,The patient is fully weight bearing on the left lower extremity.,The patient is non-weight bearing on the left lower extremity.,The patient is partial weight bearing on the left lower extremity.,Touchdown weight bearing is applicable for the patient on the left lower extremity.,The patient is unable to use the left lower extremity at all.,D,"In the notes from the second discharge, it is indicated that the patient is ""touchdown weight bearing in the left lower extremity"". This suggests that the patient is only putting minimal weight on the extremity, likely only the toes are touching the ground. Option A contradicts the second discharge note and options B, C and E are incorrect as they inaccurately represent the patient's progress on ambulation and weight bearing at the time of the second discharge."
125,2,15644444,What was the patient's tentative cause of erythema and swelling in his left leg on his second admission?,An abrasion on his shin provoked the symptoms,Intensive extension of the acute fracture in the left leg,Sudden rise in white blood cell count,Allergic reaction to vancomycin,Overuse of the left leg due to anabolic steroid usage,A,"In 'note 2', it is mentioned that the patient was readmitted due to recurring erythema, pain, and fever in his left leg, which began after sustaining an abrasion on his shin (choice A). The options B-E are not valid because there was no mention of an acute fracture (choice B), the rise in white blood cell count was a symptom and not a cause (choice C), there was no allergic reaction to vancomycin mentioned (choice D) and the use of anabolic steroids was linked with polycythemia, not the erythema or swelling in the left leg (choice E)."
126,2,10382999,What medication was the patient put on after the second admission for the treatment of her elevated blood pressure?,The patient was discharged with 200mg Labetalol taken orally twice daily.,The patient was prescribed Prochlorperazine 10 mg orally every six hours to relieve headaches.,"On discharge, the patient was given Docusate Sodium 100 mg orally twice daily to aid with constipation.",The patient was prescribed magnesium.,"After the second admission, the patient was treated with NIFEdipine CR 30 mg orally daily.",E,"After her second admission to the hospital, the patient was discharged with a prescription for NIFEdipine CR 30 mg taken orally once daily for the treatment of her elevated blood pressure, as stated in note 2. All other options, while medications mentioned in the notes, are incorrect since they are not used to treat hypertension. Prochlorperazine was given for headaches (option B), Docusate Sodium for constipation (option C), and magnesium was administered during the first hospital admission to treat pre-eclampsia, not elevated blood pressure (option D). Labetalol (option A) was the prescription after the first admission, not the second."
127,2,12202640,"What was the patient's clinical progression that required surgery in the second admission, with reference to the diagnoses in both discharge summaries?",The patient underwent elective left hemithyroidectomy due to Hurthle cell lesion of the left thyroid lobe resulted to hypertension requiring correction surgery.,"The patient who initially suffered from a Hurthle cell lesion underwent surgery for left thyroid lobectomy, which reappeared as carcinoma, and hence needed surgery for right lobe removal.","The diagnosis shifted from Hurthle cell lesion to GERD and chronic cough in the second admission, leading to surgery.",The patient's Hurthle cell carcinoma worsened triggering surgery for right lobe removal.,"Due to unsuccessful hernia repair and knee surgery, the patient required surgery for Hurthle cell lesion.",B,"In the first admission, the diagnosis was Hurthle cell lesion, and the patient underwent an elective left thyroid lobectomy. Unfortunately, the pathology report identified the cytology as Hurthle cell carcinoma. In the second admission, the patient was operated on again, this time for completion thyroidectomy to remove the remaining right thyroid lobe. The other choices are incorrect. Option A is wrong, as hypertension was a prior condition and not the reason for the second surgery. Option C is incorrect because GERD and chronic cough were a part of past medical history, not triggering the surgery. Option D is incorrect because there was no mention of the cancer worsening. Option E is unrelated to the correct answer as hist knee and hernia surgeries were part of past medical history and did not trigger these thyroid surgeries."
128,2,14772835,What was the significant change in the patient's hematological parameters in respect to Red blood cell count and Hemoglobin levels between the first and second visit?,The patient's Red blood cell count and Hemoglobin levels decreased significantly.,The patient's Red blood cell count and Hemoglobin levels remained the same.,The patient's Red blood cell count and Hemoglobin levels increased slightly.,The patient's Red blood cell count decreased while Hemoglobin levels increased.,The patient's Red blood cell count increased while Hemoglobin levels decreased.,C,"According to the hematological data provided in the notes, the patient's RBC count increased from 3.94 to 4.15 between the first and second visit and her Hgb (Hemoglobin) levels increased from 10.3 to 11.1. Therefore, the correct answer is C - The patient's Red blood cell count and Hemoglobin levels increased slightly. The rest of the options are incorrect but are included as distractors since they involve possible outcomes for hematological parameters. Option A mentioned a decrease which is not supported by the data, while option B suggested no change which is equally incorrect based on the provided data. Options D and E involved an increase in one parameter and a decrease in the other, which is not supported by the provided notes."
129,2,18503876,What were the complications and interventions related to the patient's urinary issues after undergoing lumbar laminectomy surgery during their first admission?,The patient had bladder complications following the surgery and was treated with Cipro for a suspected UTI and urinary catheter insertion if urination difficulties persisted.,"The patient had no complications following the surgery, all bladder and bowel functions were normal.","The patient developed constipation following the surgery, and a bowel regimen was initiated.",The patient experienced a sudden increase in pain that could not be managed by pain medications.,"The patient showed signs of infection at the wound site, including redness, swelling, tenderness, and drainage.",A,"In the discharge summary, it is mentioned that the patient had difficulty voiding her bladder and was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (indicated by leukocytosis in the Urinalysis) following the lumbar laminectomy procedure. The patient was treated with Cipro (antibiotic) for UTI, and it was planned to place a Foley catheter if the patient was still unable to void her bladder at the time of discharge preparation (choice A). The other options, while present in the discharge summary, do not answer the question since it specially asks for complications and interventions related to the urinary issue of the patient. Therefore, options B, C, D and E are incorrect distractors. Option B is incorrect as the patient did experience bladder complications. Option C speaks about the patient's difficulty in moving the bowel but not the complication related to urinary issues. Option D and E are incorrect as they are drawn from the surgeon's post-operative instructions, indicating possible complications rather than actual ones experienced by the patient."
130,2,16327870,"What was the ongoing issue with the patient's pregnancy during her first admission, and did it continue to present an issue in her second admission?","The patient was suffering from preterm contractions in her first visit, and her condition remained unchanged in the second visit.","Intra-uterine growth restriction was diagnosed in the initial admission, and it persisted in the subsequent hospital visit.","The patient was diagnosed with depression during her first visit, and it continued to be a problem in the second visit.","The patient had a history of four prior cesarean sections, and the same was a concern in her next visit.","The patient was dealing with complications due to her history of suicide attempts, which continued to be a concern during the next admission.",B,"In the first admission, the patient was admitted for management of confirmed intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), a condition in which the baby's growth is compromised, and the baby is not reaching its growth potential. This information is mentioned in the first discharge summary under the 'brief hospital course' and 'discharge diagnosis' sections. But during the second admission, there's no mention of IUGR, indicating that it was no longer a problem. Other options are incorrect as the problems mentioned in them were either not an issue during the first admission (preterm contractions, depression, history of cesarean sections) or not related to her pregnancy (history of suicide attempts)."
131,2,11402501,"What known medical conditions or factors, if any, made the patient's pregnancies high-risk?",The pregnancies were high risk due to the patient's history of allergic reactions.,"The patient had existing conditions of hypertension and diabetes, making the pregnancies high-risk.",A history of poor weight gain and size less than dates during pregnancies contributed to the high-risk status.,"The patient had conditions of heart disease and lung issues, thereby making the pregnancies high-risk.",The pregnancies were high risk due to the patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption.,C,"The discharge summary in note 1 mentions that the patient's prenatal course included poor weight gain and size less than dates at her last visit, indicating a potential risk factor for pregnancy. Answer A is incorrect as the patient had no known allergies. Answer B is not accurate as there is no mention of hypertension or diabetes in the patient's medical history. D and E are inappropriate since the patient is not reported to have heart or lung diseases, nor does she have a history of smoking or alcohol consumption, as per the discharge notes."
132,2,19169790,What were the discharge medications prescribed after the patient's second surgery?,Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for pain relief,Levothyroxine for thyroid hormone replacement,Calcium Carbonate for supplement,Acetaminophen for moderate pain relief,Flagyl vaginal gel,B,"According to the discharge summary note 2, the patient was discharged with Levothyroxine (B), Calcium Carbonate (C), and Acetaminophen (D) after her second surgery. Options A and E are incorrect, as Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen was given after the first surgery (see note 1), and Flagyl vaginal gel was a medication on admission. Option B is included because levothyroxine was prescribed to replace the thyroid hormone after the total thyroidectomy, a medication specifically mentioned in the discharge summary. Option C, Calcium Carbonate, is a supplement to prevent low calcium, which can occur after thyroidectomy. Option D, Acetaminophen, was prescribed for mild pain relief. Although these are all mentioned in the discharge summary, they are listed as discharge medications only after the second surgery."
133,2,16974062,What was the primary complaint of the patient during his first admission and what surgical procedure was performed to address this issue?,"The patient's first admission was for a right flank ache, which was addressed by a laparoscopic appendectomy.","The patient's primary complaint upon first admission was a chest pain, consequently treated with coronary angioplasty.","During his first admission, the patient mainly complained about high cholesterol and depression, which was managed by lifestyle modifications and medications.",The patient's first admission was due to left shoulder pain and was treated by a rotator cuff revision reconstruction with marrow/prp enhancement.,The patient was initially admitted due to neurological issues and underwent brain surgery.,D,"The question asks about the primary complaint during the patient's first admission and the corresponding medical procedure. In Note 1, it is mentioned that the patient had left shoulder pain and underwent rotator cuff revision reconstruction with marrow/prp enhancement during his first admission.   - Option A is incorrect because the first complaint was not right flank pain, and laparoscopic appendectomy was not performed. - Option B is incorrect since the patient did not complain about chest pain, and coronary angioplasty was never carried out. - Option C is incorrect because high cholesterol and depression were part of his past medical history on two separate admissions, not the primary complaints upon initial admission. - Option E is incorrect since the notes do not mention any neurological issues or brain surgery."
134,2,13194690,What procedure was performed to manage the patient's severe pre-eclampsia during her last delivery?,The patient was administered with labetalol in IV form.,The patient received a cesarean section along with bilateral tubal ligation.,The patient was given magnesium sulfate.,The patient was put in an induced labor.,The patient was treated with nifedipine 30mg CR QD.,B,"The correct answer is B. As mentioned in the discharge summary, the patient was taken to the Operating Room for delivery due to severe pre-eclampsia which was in the form of a repeat cesarean section along with bilateral tubal ligation. Option A is incorrect despite being mentioned in the summary as the use of labetalol in IV form was done to manage her high blood pressures but not the delivery itself. Similarly, option C is not the correct answer because although magnesium sulfate was administered, it was for the management of pre-eclampsia symptoms and not for the delivery procedure. And option D is not accurate because there was no mention of inducing labor, instead the patient was taken for a cesarean delivery. Finally, answer choice E, the use of nifedipine 30mg CR QD, was indeed mentioned in the discharge summary but this was administered postpartum for controlling her blood pressure, which doesn't answer the question where the treatment is related to her delivery."
135,2,16623329,"What was the major surgical procedure performed on the patient during her first admission, and what was the reason for it?",The patient had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to pancreatic inflammation.,She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of an abdominal pain after meals for 3 months.,The patient had a hysterectomy due to abdominal discomfort.,The patient underwent gallstone removal surgery due to biliary stones.,The patient had a colectomy because of GI infection.,B,"According to the contents of note 1, the patient has undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to a chronic abdominal pain that was particularly felt after meals. Answer B is correct because it encapsulates this information accurately. Options A, C, D, and E are good distractors. Even though information about the patient suffering from abdominal pain (option C), and about gallstones or biliary colic (option D), appears in the summary, the actual surgery performed was not a hysterectomy or gallstone removal. Furthermore, there is no mention of a pancreatic inflammation (option A) or a GI infection (option E)."
136,2,17042547,What was the cause of the reported abdominal pain during the patient's second admission?,Abdominal pain was due to pregnancy-induced hypertension.,The abdominal pain was caused by a concealed large placental abruption.,The cause of the abdominal pain was postpartum pre-eclampsia.,The pain was most likely due to musculoskeletal issues.,Abdominal pain was due to a urinary tract infection.,D,"In the second admission note, the patient was evaluated for her flank/abdominal pain, and based on the evaluation, the pain was most likely due to musculoskeletal issues.  Option A is incorrect as there is no mention of pregnancy-induced hypertension causing abdominal pain in either of the notes.  Option B is misleading, the concealed large placental abruption was the cause of abdominal pain during her first admission, not the second one.  Option C is also incorrect; the patient had symptoms of postpartum preeclampsia, but those do not include abdominal pain. Option E is incorrect because the patient did not have a urinary tract infection during the second admission as per the notes. The urine tests returned negative for infection."
137,2,18548422,What was the major surgical procedure conducted during the patient's second visit and what was the patient's condition upon discharge post this procedure?,The patient underwent a surgical removal of the left kidney. His conditions post-surgery were stable.,"The patient received surgery for an inguinal hernia on the left side, using a mesh for the repair. After the surgery, the patient was stable and able to move independently.",The patient didn't have any surgical procedures during his second visit. He was active and alert upon discharging.,"The patient underwent an abdominal surgery. Post-operation, the patient was comfortable and in stable condition.",A lung surgery was done on the patient during his second visit. The patient was doing well and alert upon his discharge.,B,"In note 2, it is mentioned that the patient underwent a 'Left open inguinal hernia repair with mesh' during his second visit. His discharge condition is described as 'Alert and interactive' with activity status being 'Ambulatory - Independent'. Answer choice B correctly sums up this information without quoting the provided note verbatim. In all other options, either the wrong surgical procedure or wrong discharge condition is mentioned, which makes them good distractors even though they retain content from the discharge notes."
138,2,13853881,"What was the primary medication that was provided to the patient to manage her severe headache, as described in her discharge summary from her first visit described on the 2166-12-16 chartdate?",The patient was given a high-dosage of acetaminophen.,Treatment was handled using Tylenol primarily.,The main treatment strategy involved Novolog Pump.,The principal medication used was Fioricet.,Reglan was primarily administered for the severe headache.,D,"The discharge summary provides information that the patient was treated with Fioricet for her severe headache. This is not stated verbatim – the summary on the stated chartdate says 'treated with fiorocet, dilaudid, prochloperazine and improved.' Although other medications like acetaminophen, Tylenol, and Reglan were used, the Fioricet was primarily used for headache management as indicated by the discharge instructions 'Use fioricet as needed for headache.' This indicates it was the primary medication. Other medications like acetaminophen (Choice A), Tylenol (Choice B), Novolog Pump (Choice C), and Reglan (Choice E) are mentioned in the summary, making them reasonable but incorrect options."
139,2,18703657,What were the patient's discharge medications after her second visit and how did they change from her first visit?,"Her discharge medications after the second visit included Levothyroxine Sodium 200 mcg, Labetalol 300 mg, and Nifedipine 30mg, while her first visit included Zofran 4mg ODT and Nifedipine CR 30mg.","The patient's discharge medications after the second visit included Nifedipine CR 30mg and Levoxyl 200mcg, and they didn't change from her first visit.","The patient remained on Nifedipine CR 30mg, Pepcid 20mg, Zofran 4mg, and PNV after her initial visit, while the addition of Labetalol 300mg, Levothyroxine Sodium 200mcg, and Acetaminophen occurred after her second visit.","After her second visit, the patient's medications were changed to Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen 600mg, and Ranitidine 150 mg, previously she was taking Nifedipine CR 30mg daily, Pepcid 20mg BID, Zofran 4mg, and PNV.","The patient's discharge medications remained the same after her second visit: Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen 600mg, Labetalol 300mg, and Levothyroxine Sodium 200mcg were added after her first visit.",D,"From the mention of ""Medications on Admission"" and ""Discharge Medications"" in both notes, we can see that the patient was on Nifedipine CR 30mg daily, Pepcid 20mg po BID, Zofran 4mg ODT, and PNV during her first visit. However, during the second visit, her medications were changed to Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen 600mg, Labetalol 300mg, Levothyroxine Sodium 200mcg, OxyCODONE, and Ranitidine 150 mg. Other answer choices incorrectly report the discharged medications of the patient or incorrectly describe the changes in her medications from the first visit to the second one."
140,2,11548046,What were the postoperative instructions for the patient during her first hospitalization for right foot ankle instability?,The patient was instructed to perform ankle strengthening exercises at home.,"The patient was instructed to stay in her splint until follow up in two weeks, remain partial weightbearing, and was prescribed oral pain medications.",She was asked to visit an orthopedic specialist every three days for her rehabilitation.,The patient was instructed to apply a heat pad to her ankle daily.,The patient was to refrain from any physical activities.,B,"As per the discharge summary from the first hospitalization, the patient was asked to stay in her splint until followup in two weeks. During this time, she needed to maintain partial weightbearing on the right leg with the help of crutches. She also was prescribed oral pain medications to manage discomfort. Choices A, C, D, and E are incorrect. There was no mention of exercises at home (choice A), visits to an orthopedic specialist every three days (choice C), use of a heat pad (choice D), or total restriction from physical activities (choice E) in the patient’s discharge instructions."
141,2,10603028,"What changes were observed between past and present examinations in the patient's cognitive and motor function, and what specific modifications of medication were adopted during the course of the treatment for pituitary macroadenoma?","The patient's motor function showed vast improvement with significant increase in strength, and Amlodipine 5mg daily was replaced with Amlodipine 10mg daily.","The patient's cognitive and motor functions remained unchanged from baseline, and Oxcarbazepine 600mg BID and Phenobarbital 60mg BID were added to the medication regimen.",The patient was unable to follow simple commands and Oxcarbazepine dosage was doubled.,"The patient's cognitive function deteriorated but motor function remained at baseline, and Amlodipine 5mg daily was replaced with Amlodipine 10mg daily.","No significant changes in the patient's cognitive and motor functions were observed, and the dosage of Amlodipine was increased from 5mg daily to 10mg daily.",E,"In the past and present examinations, the notes indicate that the patient's cognitive and motor capabilities have not significantly changed. He remained cognitively delayed, dysarthric, and needing assistance with mobility. Regarding medication modification, the notes show that Amlodipine was increased from 5mg to 10mg daily. So, option E is correct.  Option A is incorrect as there was no vast improvement in motor function. Option B is wrong because Oxcarbazepine 600mg BID and Phenobarbital 60mg BID were already part of the patient's medication regimen prior to his admission. Option C is incorrect as the patient was able to follow complex commands and there was no mention of doubling Oxcarbazepine dosage. Option D is incorrect as the records don't show any further deterioration in cognitive function."
142,2,17017707,"What were the primary clinical concerns during the patient's first and second admission, and what major surgical or invasive procedures were performed to address these concerns?","The primary clinical concerns were bilateral subdural hygromas and severe mitral valve regurgitation, with no reported procedures to address these concerns.",The primary concerns during the first admission was memory loss and during the second admission was osteopenia. Invasive procedures performed were MRI scan and ultrasound respectively.,The chief concerns were aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm for the first and second admissions respectively. The major surgeries were Left ICA Aneurysm Pipeline and thrombin injection of the right groin pseudoaneurysm respectively.,The primary clinical concerns were pseudoaneurysm and hematoma during the first admission and no specific concerns were reported in the second admission.,"The patient's primary concerns were hematoma and pseudoaneurysm during the first admission, and memory loss and severe mitral valve regurgitation during the second admission.",C,"In the first admission, the chief complaint was an aneurysm and the major procedure performed was a Left ICA Aneurysm Pipeline according to the discharge summary. In the second admission, the chief complaint was a right groin pseudoaneurysm and the major procedure performed was a thrombin injection of the right groin pseudoaneurysm.   Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they either misidentified the clinical concerns (such as bilateral subdural hygromas, severe mitral valve regurgitation, osteopenia, hematoma, and memory loss) or misrepresented the surgical procedures performed. However, these options served as good distractors because these conditions or procedures were mentioned elsewhere in the patient’s medical history or hospital course, but they were not the primary concerns or procedures performed during the first and second admissions."
143,2,17908346,"Was the patient's pregnancy full-term during her second recorded admission, and why was a cesarean section required?","The admission was due to a kidney stone issue, and she underwent cesarean because of a repeat procedure.",The pregnancy was not full-term. The cesarean was conducted because of non-reassuring fetal monitoring.,The patient's full-term pregnancy admission was due to a fall. The cesarean section was required due to non-reassuring fetal monitoring.,"The admission was for an oropharyngeal mass, and the cesarean section was performed due to previous such surgeries.","The pregnancy was not full-term, and the cesarean section was performed as a routine procedure.",C,"In note 2, we learn that the patient had a full-term pregnancy and fell, which is why she was admitted. Following the fall, a cesarean section was performed due to non-reassuring fetal monitoring.   Options A, D, and E are incorrect because these situations are not mentioned in the patient's notes. Option B is incorrect because, although the cesarean section was performed due to non-reassuring fetal monitoring, the pregnancy was actually at full-term, not at an earlier stage."
144,2,13870896,What changes were made to the patient's post-discharge medication regimen between the visits charted on 2119-08-03 and 2119-08-07?,Pravastatin dosage decreased to one tablet per day.,Introduced multivitamin and discontinued all other medications.,"Removed Phenazopyridine and Acetaminophen-Codeine, and added Multivitamin and Finasteride.",Solely continued with Latanoprost and Dorzolamide-Timolol prescriptions.,Introduced Acetaminophen-Codeine and stopped the use of Pravastatin.,C,"In the comparison of the patient’s discharge medications on 2119-08-03 and 2119-08-07 charts, the Phenazopyridine and Acetaminophen-Codeine medications were indeed dropped, and Multivitamin and Finasteride were introduced as new medications. The rest of the medications were consistent, making option C the correct answer.   Option A is incorrect as the dosage of Pravastatin remained unchanged. Option B is misleading because even though Multivitamin was introduced, not all other medications were discontinued. Option D is also not true as more than just Latanoprost and Dorzolamide-Timolol was continued. Lastly, Acetaminophen-Codeine, as suggested by option E, was actually discontinued instead of being introduced, and Pravastatin was not stopped either, making it an incorrect choice."
145,2,18640063,"What was the cause of the patient's fever and right flank pain after her right ureteral stent was removed, and how was it treated?","The patient's pain and fever were due to recurring kidney stones, and the treatment was a course of Macrobid.",The patient experienced fever and right flank pain due to a benign brain cyst. She was treated with Propranolol.,The patient had fever and right flank pain due to her hypertension and was treated with Propranolol.,The patient's fever and right flank pain resulted from right obstructed pyelonephritis. She was treated with gentamicin and a 14-day course of Ciprofloxacin.,"The symptoms were caused by a residual nephrolithiasis, treated by another session of ureteroscopy.",D,"The patient's fever and right flank pain after the removal of her right ureteral stent were caused by right obstructed pyelonephritis as per note 2. This condition was treated with a right ureteral stent placement, gentamicin, and a 14-day course of Ciprofloxacin.   Option A is incorrect as the kidney stones were treated, and Macrobid was used for urinary tract infections, not specifically for kidney stones. Option B is not correct because the benign brain cyst did not cause the fever and flank pain. Option C is wrong as hypertension doesn't usually cause fever and flank pain. Option E is incorrect as the residual nephrolithiasis noted in the first note was planned to be addressed but was not stated as the cause of the patient's fever and right flank pain in the second note."
146,2,18160798,What were the treatments given to the patient during her first and second hospital admissions for mastitis?,"The patient was given ibuprofen and Xulane, followed by a course of dicloxacillin in her first admission, and later vancomycin during her second admission.","During her first admission, the patient was treated with dicloxacillin, and her pain was controlled with Tylenol and Motrin. She was encouraged for frequent pumping and to apply warm compresses. After her readmission, she was treated with IV clindamycin.","Treatment during the first admission included a course of dicloxacillin, and in her second admission, she was given intravenous clindamycin, after developing a rash from vancomycin.","In her first admission, the patient was treated with PNV, colace, iron, ibuprofen, and in her second admission, she was treated with a course of vancomycin.","The patient was initially treated with dicloxacillin in her first admission. For her second admission, she was treated with nasal staph swab and breastmilk culture.",C,"The patient was initially treated with a 10-day course of dicloxacillin during her first admission (B is wrong due to the mention of Tylenol and Motrin, which were used for symptoms relief, not directly for mastitis). During her second admission, the patient developed a rash from vancomycin and was subsequently treated with intravenous Clindamycin (A and D are wrong due to incorrect combination of drugs used in each hospitalization; E is wrong because nasal staph swab and breastmilk culture are diagnostic procedures, not treatments)."
147,2,10177094,"What was the method used for treating the patient's ectopic pregnancy during the first admission, and how was it further managed during the second admission?",The patient was treated with a multi-dose regimen of allosteric modulators during the first admission and underwent an emergency hysterectomy during the second admission.,The patient was administered antibiotics during the first admission and managed by watchful waiting during the second admission.,"The patient received a multi-dose regimen of methotrexate injections during the first admission, and underwent a dilation and curettage procedure during the subsequent admission.",The patient was treated with a multi-dose of corticosteroids during the first admission and a multi-dose regimen of painkillers during the second admission.,The patient was treated with a multi-dose of antivirals during the first admission and managed by bed rest during the second admission.,C,"In the first admission, the patient was given a multi-dose methotrexate regimen for treating an ectopic pregnancy, as mentioned in the discharge summary. In the second admission, the patient underwent a dilation and curettage procedure to handle the issue of ectopically located pregnancy remnants. Choices A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they contain treatments not mentioned in the patient's notes. Methotrexate has immunosuppressive effects but is not a corticosteroid (as in D), and there is no mention of antibiotics, antivirals, allosteric modulators, watchful waiting, or bed rest in the discharge summaries. An emergency hysterectomy (as in A) was also not performed."
148,2,18346141,"What was the result of the patient's full GTT test, and which healthcare measures were taken as a result?",The full GTT test was not done and the patient was advised to do it in her next check-up.,"The full GTT test showed that the patient had hypoglycemia, and the patient was recommended a low sugar diet.",The full GTT test was positive for gestational diabetes and diet education counseling was provided.,The full GTT test found the patient to be at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in the future.,The full GTT test did not show any significant results and no particular healthcare measures were undertaken.,C,"In the discharge summary [note 2], it is stated that ""A full GTT was preformed as an inpatient which was positive for gestational diabetes."" Following this diagnosis, the patient ""received diet education counseling."" Thus, option C is correct.   Option A is incorrect because it is specifically stated that the GTT was performed. Option B incorrectly states that the patient had hypoglycemia, whereas the notes specify gestational diabetes. Option D makes an incorrect claim that the patient is at risk for Type 2 diabetes. Option E is also incorrect as it contradicts the information in the notes, stating that there were no significant results from the GTT test and no healthcare measures were undertaken. These options are plausible distractors as they also delve into topics related to the GTT test, but the information they provide does not coincide with the given notes."
149,2,18359614,What medical treatment was prescribed for patient's pain management after the fall in March 2113 and the one in April 2120?,The patient was administered dopamine and morphine for pain control.,"For pain management, the patient was given Dilaudid and Tylenol in 2113 and cafegot and oxycodone in 2120.","For the fall in 2113, the patient was prescribed oral Dilaudid and Tylenol as needed. In the case of the 2120 fall, the patient's pain was managed through oral agents and Lidocaine patches.",IV fluids and antibiotics were used to manage the patient's pain after the fall.,"For pain management, the patient was given prednisolone drops and heparin injections.",C,"According to the discharge summaries, during the March 2113 fall, the patient was given Dilaudid and Tylenol for pain management. After the April 2120 fall, oral medications and Lidocaine patches were used to alleviate the patient's pain. The other options are incorrect as there is no mention in the summaries of using dopamine, morphine, cafegot, or oxycodone (A, B), nor were IV fluids and antibiotics used for pain management (D). Option E lists prednisolone drops and heparin injections, but these were not prescribed for pain management."
150,2,18003464,"What surgical procedure has the patient undergone, and what was the result of his postoperative course, as per the note charted on 2146-05-08?",The patient underwent a tonsillectomy and experienced periodic blood in urine postoperatively.,A cyberknife treatment for prostate cancer was conducted and the patient endured foley catheter insertion.,The patient underwent cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate with no postoperative complications.,Surgical repair of the left tibia fracture was performed and the patient faced urinary retention issues.,The patient was operated for the resection of multiple nonmelanomatous skin cancers and experienced no postoperative complications.,C,"According to the note charted on 2146-05-08, the patient underwent a ""Cystoscopy, transurethral resection of prostate"" procedure which is reflected in answer ""C"". The postoperative course was uncomplicated as mentioned in the same note, making ""C"" the correct choice. All other choices can be valid if we look at the patient's history, but they don't correspond with the specific details of the surgical procedure and post-operative course charted on the specified date. Thus, options A, B, D, and E are incorrect, yet serve as good distractors because they contain interventions outlined throughout the patient's medical history."
