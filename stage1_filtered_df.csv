Discharge Instructions:
These steps can help you recover after your procedure. 
Drink plenty of water to flush out the bladder. 
Avoid straining during a bowel movement. Eat fiber-containing 
foods and avoid foods that can cause constipation. Ask your 
doctor if you should take a laxative if you do become 
constipated. 
Don't take blood-thinning medications until your doctor says 
it's OK. 
Don't do any strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 
four to six weeks or until your doctor says it's OK. 
Don't have sex. You'll likely be able to resume sexual 
activity in about four to six weeks. 
Don't drive until your doctor says it's OK. ___, you can 
drive once your catheter is removed and you're no longer taking 
prescription pain medications. 
 
-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications EXCEPT as noted. You 
should ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication 
changes and your post-operative course with your primary care 
doctor.  

Should you HOLD ASPIRIN? Unless otherwise advised;  If the urine 
is still pink, hold the aspirin until it has been clear/yellow 
for at least three days. 

-If prescribed; complete the full course of antibiotics.

-You may be discharged home with a medication called PYRIDIUM 
that will help with the ""burning"" pain you may experience when 
voiding. This medication may turn your urine bright orange.

-Colace has been prescribed to avoid post surgical constipation 
and constipation related to narcotic pain medication. 
Discontinue if loose stool or diarrhea develops. Colace is a 
stool softener, NOT a laxative

- AVOID STRAINING for bowel movements as this may stir up 
bleeding.

-Do not eat constipating foods for ___ weeks, drink plenty of 
fluids to keep hydrated

-No vigorous physical activity or sports for 4 weeks or until 
otherwise advised

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) or 
participate in high intensity physical activity for a minimum of 
four weeks or until you are cleared by your Urologist in 
follow-up

-Tylenol should be your first line pain medication, a narcotic 
pain medication has been prescribed for breakthrough pain >4. 
Replace Tylenol with narcotic pain medication.

-Max daily Tylenol (acetaminophen) dose is 4 grams from ALL 
sources, note that narcotic pain medication also contains 
Tylenol

-Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do not 
operate dangerous machinery. Also, if the Foley catheter and Leg 
Bag are in place--Do NOT drive (you may be a passenger).

WHEN YOU ARE DISCHARGED WITH A FOLEY CATHETER:
-Please also reference the nursing handout and instructions on 
routine care and hygiene

-Your Foley should be secured to the catheter secure on your 
thigh at ALL times until your follow up with the surgeon.

-IF YOU HAVE A PRESCRIPTION FOR DITROPAN/OXYBUTININ: YOU MUST 
STOP at least 24hours before planned foley removal and void 
trial.

-DO NOT have anyone else other than your Surgeon or your

Pertinent Results:
CT/CTA: ___. Complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery 
starting in its proximal segment and extending into the proximal 
right middle cerebral artery. There is abnormal blood flow, 
blood volume, and mean transit time in the right  MCA 
distribution, however on the CTA there are robust pial 
collaterals, and therefore the perfusion abnormalities are less 
cortical and more central. 
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  
  
MRI: ___
Acute right basal ganglia and posterior temporal lobe infarcts 
in 
the MCA territory. Chronic watershed infarcts in the frontal and 
the parietal  regions. No hemorrhage. Absence of flow void in 
the right internal carotid artery indicative of occlusion. 

C: ___. No interval change since CT of ___ with presence 
of cytotoxic edema in the right basal ganglia and right 
posterior temporal lobe compatible with infarct seen on MRI 
performed on ___. No additional areas of territorial 
infarction noted. 
2. Unchanged hyperdensity in the right basal ganglia, compatible 
with 
petechial hemorrhage. 
3. Minimal mass effect without midline shift or evidence of 
herniation point. 
4. Redemonstration of right ICA/MCA compatible with occlusion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old right-handed man with a
history notable for a prostate cancer and remote smoking who
presented with sudden onset left sided face, arm and leg 
weakness
after raking leaves the day before admission.  

He initially went to ___, and then Medflighted to
___, where his ___ Stroke Scale score was 14. Onset was deemed
to be > 6 hours ago. 

NCHCT:  CT/ CTA showed a dense right MCA, a complete occlusion 
of
the right ICA from the origin and MCA. He also has a right
carotid dissection. CTP showed that his MTT is prolonged,
predominantly in the right inferior division with a diminished
CBV at the right M2 level. 

His examination is remarkable at discharge for his right gaze 
preference (but
crosses the midline), motor neglect on the left (though he
recognizes his left hand). There is a left facial droop and
distal weakness in the left arm and leg.

We felt that he had had a right ICA dissection with a RIGHT ACA 
stroke (A2 occlusion) and RIGHT MCA hyperdense sign and a 
subsequent M2 stroke. We started a heparin drip. Once his MCA 
symptoms became stable and with his A2 ACA occluded, we decided 
to stop hep drip in the ligh tof a minor hemorrhagic conversion 
in the M2 stroke. He remained on coumadin, though. We have a 
goal INR of ___. In addition, we provided him with Ritalin in an 
attempt to stimulate his arousal systems with a good clinical 
response.   
and work him out (including TTE), though a cardiac source seems
unlikely in this context.

Pertinent Results:
CT/CTA: ___. Complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery
starting in its proximal segment and extending into the proximal
right middle cerebral artery. There is abnormal blood flow,
blood volume, and mean transit time in the right MCA
distribution, however on the CTA there are robust pial
collaterals, and therefore the perfusion abnormalities are less
cortical and more central.
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI: ___
Acute right basal ganglia and posterior temporal lobe infarcts
in
the MCA territory. Chronic watershed infarcts in the frontal and
the parietal regions. No hemorrhage. Absence of flow void in
the right internal carotid artery indicative of occlusion.
C: ___. No interval change since CT of ___ with presence
of cytotoxic edema in the right basal ganglia and right
posterior temporal lobe compatible with infarct seen on MRI
performed on ___. No additional areas of territorial
infarction noted.
2. Unchanged hyperdensity in the right basal ganglia, compatible
with
petechial hemorrhage.
3. Minimal mass effect without midline shift or evidence of
herniation point.
4. Redemonstration of right ICA/MCA compatible with occlusion.
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old right-handed man with a
history notable for a prostate cancer and remote smoking who
presented with sudden onset left sided face, arm and leg
weakness
after raking leaves the day before admission.
He initially went to ___, and then Medflighted to
___, where his ___ Stroke Scale score was 14. Onset was deemed
to be > 6 hours ago.
NCHCT: CT/ CTA showed a dense right MCA, a complete occlusion
of
the right ICA from the origin and MCA. He also has a right
carotid dissection. CTP showed that his MTT is prolonged,
predominantly in the right inferior division with a diminished
CBV at the right M2 level.
His examination is remarkable at discharge for his right gaze
preference (but
crosses the midline), motor neglect on the left (though he
recognizes his left hand). There is a left facial droop and
distal weakness in the left arm and leg.
We felt that he had had a right ICA dissection with a RIGHT ACA
stroke (A2 occlusion) and RIGHT MCA hyperdense sign and a
subsequent M2 stroke. We started a heparin drip. Once his MCA
symptoms became stable and with his A2 ACA occluded, we decided
to stop hep drip in the ligh tof a minor hemorrhagic conversion
in the M2 stroke. He remained on coumadin, though. We have a
goal INR of ___. In addition, we provided him with Ritalin in an
attempt to stimulate his arousal systems with a good clinical
response.
and work him out (including TTE), though a cardiac source seems
unlikely in this context.

RADIOLOGY
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of ___ 3:15 ___ 
INDICATION: Left inguinal and thigh pain. 
COMPARISON: Ultrasound from ___. 
FINDINGS: Waveforms at the common femoral veins show appropriate 
respiratory variability and response to Valsalva maneuvers on 
the right, and absent flow on the left. Echogenic material is 
visualized within the vein on the left and there is no evidence 
of flow on color Doppler analysis. Similar echogenic material is 
seen along the length of the superficial femoral vein which is 
noncompressible. Additionally, material seen in the popliteal 
vein, which is also non-compressible, which has no evidence of 
flow on color Doppler analysis. Echogenic material is also seen 
within the posterior tibial and peroneal vein on the left. In 
the right lower extremity, the common femoral, proximal greater 
saphenous, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins are all 
appropriately compatible. Note is made however of slightly 
isoechoic appearance to the internal contents, which was seen in 
real time to represent slow moving blood. Wall-to-wall flow is 
also noted in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins in the 
calf. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity 
extending 
from the common femoral vein into the posterior tibial and 
peroneal veins in the calf. 2. No evidence of deep venous 
thrombosis in the right lower extremity, however note is made of 
slow flow.

Discharge Instructions:
 Dear Ms ___,  
 It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
a laparascopic gastric wedge resection on ___. You tolerated 
the procedure well and are ambulating, tolerating a regular 
diet, and your pain is controlled by pain medications by mouth. 
You are now ready to be discharged to home. Please follow the 
recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery.  
 ACTIVITY:  
 - Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.  
 - You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day.  
 - You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.  
 - You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.  
 - Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first.  
 - No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks.  
 - You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told 
you otherwise.  
 HOW YOU MAY FEEL:  
 - You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.  
 - You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.  
 YOUR BOWELS:  
 - Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicine such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool 
softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such 
as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of 
these medicines without a prescription.  
 - If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.  
 - After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.  
 PAIN MANAGEMENT:  
 - You are being discharged with a prescription for oxycodone 
for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 
to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated.  
 - Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. 
 
 If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:  
 - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours  
 - chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness  
 - cough, shortness of breath, wheezing  
 - pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever  
 - shaking chills, fever of more than 101  
 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain  
 - nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications  
 - if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)  
 -any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you  
 MEDICATIONS:  
 - Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.  
 - If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon.  
 WOUND CARE:  
 -You may shower with any bandage strips that may be covering 
your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off.  
 -Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team.  
 -Notify your surgeon if you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage.  
 Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for 
allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a 
quick return to your usual life and activities.

right upper extremity tremor as well
as foot cramping on the right.  She initially sought medical 
attention with her PCP.  She then saw a neurologist, who made 
the diagnosis of ___ disease.  She was given a trial of 
Levodopa, which helped her symptoms.  She has done well with the 
medications, though Compton needed to be added later on as well 
as Ropinirole.  She remains Levodopa responsive, but is now 
suffering with on and off fluctuations with severe cramping in 
the off state.  She denies any significant dyskinesias in the 
on-state.  She also denies any difficulties with falls or 
cognitive issues.  She states that sometimes she sees some 
shadows, but she has no true hallucinations and of late, she has 
had some new irritability.  Because of her on and off 
fluctuations, you referred her for possible ___ brain 
stimulation surgery.

___ year old female w/p L hip ORIF on ___ at ___, 
recently discharged to rehab on coumadin for DVT prophylaxis, 
was found to have a HCT of 21.3 down from 28 two days prior. She 
was noted to have a large L flank ecchymosis and CT at ___- 
___ revealed a large bleed in the left psoas muscle. It was 
unclear whether she had active bleeding. Her INR was noted to be 
elevated at 2.4. At ___, she initially received 2 units of 
FFP, 2 units of PRBCs, and 10 of vitamin K. She was taken to 
interventional radiology where they could not find any active 
bleeding. She received an additional 2 units of blood, and was 
having hematocrits followed every 6hrs. Her hematocrits were 
stable and she was sent to the floor. Her hematocrits are stable 
on the floor, she is tolerating a regular diet, and is stable to 
go back to her rehab. She was on coumadin when she had this 
bleed, we are holding this. Instead we placed her on lovenox 
because this will be easier to reverse if she has another bleed. 
We are discharging her with this and instructions to follow up 
with her primary orthopaedic surgeon within the week to discuss 
anticoagulation.  

 
Medications on Admission:

Discharge Instructions:
* You were admitted to the hospital because of severe anemia 
coming from a spontaneous retroperitoneal.
* You required blood transfusions and your blood thinner 
medication was stopped to avoid further bleeding.
* Currently your blood count is stable and you are being 
transferred back to rehab so that you can continue with Physical 
Therapy for your hip.
*You were on coumadin after your hip surgery. We are holding the 
coumadin. In place of this we have started lovenox, because this 
is easier to reverse in case you have another bleed. You should 
follow up with your orthopaedic surgeon within 1 week to discuss 
this issue as well.

was found to have a HCT of 21.3 down from 28 two days prior. She
was noted to have a large L flank ecchymosis and CT at ___-
___ revealed a large bleed in the left psoas muscle. It was
unclear whether she had active bleeding. Her INR was noted to be
elevated at 2.4. At ___, she initially received 2 units of
FFP, 2 units of PRBCs, and 10 of vitamin K. She was taken to
interventional radiology where they could not find any active
bleeding. She received an additional 2 units of blood, and was
having hematocrits followed every 6hrs. Her hematocrits were
stable and she was sent to the floor. Her hematocrits are stable
on the floor, she is tolerating a regular diet, and is stable to
go back to her rehab. She was on coumadin when she had this
bleed, we are holding this. Instead we placed her on lovenox
because this will be easier to reverse if she has another bleed.
We are discharging her with this and instructions to follow up
with her primary orthopaedic surgeon within the week to discuss
anticoagulation.
Medications on Admission:
coumadin (by orthopedics for ___ weeks post ORIF), ciprofloxacin
for UTI until ___, tylenol ___ TID prn,oxycodone 5mg q6h prn
Discharge Medications:
1. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3
times a day).
2. ciprofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a
day for 2 days.
3. Lovenox 30 mg/0.3 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) Subcutaneous once
a day for 1 months.
4. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every ___ hours
as needed for pain.
Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care
Facility:
___
Discharge Diagnosis:
spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions:
* You were admitted to the hospital because of severe anemia
coming from a spontaneous retroperitoneal.
* You required blood transfusions and your blood thinner
medication was stopped to avoid further bleeding.
* Currently your blood count is stable and you are being
transferred back to rehab so that you can continue with Physical
Therapy for your hip.
*You were on coumadin after your hip surgery. We are holding the
coumadin. In place of this we have started lovenox, because this
is easier to reverse in case you have another bleed. You should
follow up with your orthopaedic surgeon within 1 week to discuss
this issue as well.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of dementia
residing in a memory unit and recurrent UTIs who presents with
acute onset of confusion. Patient is noncommunicative, so 
history
is taken from son ___, chart review, and discussion with
___.

Patient was sleepy yesterday, but otherwise was communicative 
and
interactive. This AM apparently very unresponsive. She was also
having difficulty breathing. She does have COPD and was a
lifelong smoker, but never had a admission before for a COPD
exacerbation. Apparently no cough or SOB. Her symptoms are
consistent with prior UTIs.

She was evaluated in the ED on ___nd altered
mental status. CT head and cervival spine were normal.  While
there, urine culture grew alpha hemolytic strep. No antibiotics
were given.

She was treated for a UTI in ___ with ciprofloxacin. She has not
been hospitalized in ___ years, since she had her ORIF.

In the ED, patient was apparently wheezing and hypoxic, with an
elevated lactic acid. A CXR was read there as concerning for
aspiration PNA. She was given 2.5 liters NS, vancomycin,
cefepime, and IV clindamycin, as well as duonebs and
methylprednisolone, and admitted to medicine for a PNA versus
COPD exacerbation.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Patient will complete a 10 day course of cipro for the UTI, 
last day to take is on ___
-Of note she had elevated JVD on exam. It is reasonable to 
presume she has CHF, with unknown EF. She appeared comfortable 
and stable on a daily exam, and is likely at euvolemia. She had 
SOB earlier in her stay resolved with
treatment of COPD, so it was unlikely due to CHF exacerbation.
But, given her COPD history, she may very well have predominant 
right
sided heart failure.
This should be followed up as an outpatient. She should have
consideration for outpatient echocardiogram, with low threshold
to initiate diuretic therapy if signs or symptoms of 
hypervolemia
occur. She should have daily weights to monitor this as well. If 
her weight exceeds 3 pounds from a baseline weight, her PCP 
should be notified.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with past
medical history of dementia residing in a memory unit and
recurrent UTIs who presented with acute onset of confusion found
to have sepsis without septic shock, most likely from a urinary
source.

She presented with UTI with now resolved sepsis from admission. 
Her confusion also returned to baseline mental status as 
confirmed by the family.
The UCx disappointingly did not isolate specific pathogenic
bacteria. It did isolate presumptive gardnerella vaginalis. She
has been transitioned to cipro PO from IV CTX earlier in her
stay, for planned 10 day course of antibiotics. However, this 
would be ineffective at treating gardnerella, which was probably 
not pathogenic as the
cause of her UTI, given her improvement on cipro alone. It is
reasonable to continue cipro course for organisms not isolated 
in the UCx as the presumed true cause of her UTI, given her 
improvement. But she should be given
metronidazole if sign/symptoms of treatment failure occurs for 
the gardnerella.

During her stay, she did have empiric IV methylprednisolone and 
nebulizers in the ED briefly for hypoxic respiratory failure 
requiring supplemental oxygen, but it was not continued as she 
had little evidence of true exacerbation of COPD on exam. It's 
more likely that the patient initially presented with hypoxia
from somnolence and hypoventilation versus aspiration 
pneumonitis. There was no evidence of secondary infection of 
aspirate, so antibiotic coverage for an aspiration pneumonia was 
not necessary.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female hx of diabetes, htn, osteoarthritis presents 
with lower extremity weakness. Patient states approximately 5 
days ago she developed lower extremity weakness. She states she 
developed lower back pain with difficulty with moving her legs 
and difficulty ambulating. These symptoms progressively worsened 
and developed burning sensation and pain to bilateral lower 
extremities. The weakness was profound and she sustained a fall. 
At baseline she ambulates without assisted devices and she had 
to use walker to get around. Patient was concerned and was seen 
by her PCP who referred her to orthopedic
surgery for possible cortisone injection to left knee. Patient 
states she felt her symptoms might be related to osteoarthritis 
as she needs a knee replacement. She was evaluated by orthopedic 
MD who recommended MRI lumbar spine. MRI lumbar spine was 
scheduled for ___ and her family was concerned regarding her 
lower extremity weakness and brought her to the ED. On 
presentation she denies urinary or fecal incontinence, 
parasthesias or numbness.  Patient was code corded in ED and MRI 
lumbar spine revealed L3-4 severe lumbar stenosis with cord 
compression. Neurosurgery consulted for further evaluation.

for bilateral lower extremity weakness. MRI and clinical 
findings were concerning and warranted surgical intervention. 
She underwent L2-5 posterior laminectomies on ___ and 
tolerated the procedure well. Post-operatively she was 
extubated, recovered in the PACU and transferred to the floor 
once stable. Post-operatively her physical exam noted minimal 
improvement with persistent foot drop thought to be unrelated to 
the spinal pathology seen intra-operatively. She was tolerating 
a diet, ambulating with assistance on POD #1, had adequate pain 
control on oral medications and voiding on her own at the time 
of discharge. Patient remained neurologically stable throughout 
her hospitalization. Social work was consulted on POD #1 given 
recent significant family loss and effective coping strategies/ 
support. ___ saw the patient on POD 1 and determined appropriate 
to discharge to rehab, case management made aware and began 
working with patient regarding placement options. Patient was 
started on ___ 24 hours post-operatively for DVT prophylaxis.

CT ABD/PEL: Terminal ileitis extending proximally along the 
distal ileum with mild adjacent inflammation of the cecum. Small 
free fluid in the pelvis may be related or may be physiologic.  
Differential diagnosis includes infection and inflammatory bowel 
disease.   
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ old, otherwise healthy, woman who presents with 
abdominal pain, fever, and nonbloody diarrhea. Imaging studies 
showed terminal ileitis extending proximally along the distal 
ileum with mild adjacent inflammation of the cecum. She was 
started empirically on ciprofloxacin and flagyl and admitted for 
further care; unfortunately, stool studies were not obtained 
prior to the initiation of antibiotics. Labs were notable for 
mild pancytopenia with iron studies suggestive a mixed anemia of 
iron deficiency and inflammation. CRP was 93, ESR was ordered 
but not reported, CMV was negative, stool cultures obtained on 
the ___ are still pending at discharge. Labs from At___ are 
negative for hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV 1+2, syphilis, 
quatiferon TB gold, and H. pylori.

She was seen in consultation by Gastroenterology who felt that 
her presentation was most likely infectious, and that she should 
complete a 2-week course of antibiotics and follow-up with 
gastroenterology for elective colonoscopy with intubation of the 
terminal ileum for assessment of potential IBD or indolent 
infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. 
Upon admission, he was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and 
underwent imaging. Cat scan imaging showed a distal small bowel 
obstruction with bowel wall thickening.  The patient underwent 
serial abdominal examinations. His white blood cell count was 
monitored.  Because of the cat scan findings, the GI service was 
consulted and recommended a MRE which showed wall edema with 
enhancement of mid ileal bowel loops without evidence of 
obstruction. Stool cultures were reported as normal. 

The patient's abdominal pain resolved with bowel rest.  He 
resumed a regular diet without recurrence of discomfort.  His 
vital signs were stable and he was afebrile. His white blood 
cell count normalized.  He was ambulatory and voiding without 
difficulty. 

An appointment for a repeat MRE was made for 6 weeks per 
recommendations of the GI service.  The patient reported that he 
would be returning to ___ in 3 weeks and will not be returning 
here.  The MRE was cancelled. If a cancellation becomes 
available, the GI service will see the patient prior to his 
departure to ___ and provide recommendations for care.

consulted and recommended a MRE which showed wall edema with
enhancement of mid ileal bowel loops without evidence of
obstruction. Stool cultures were reported as normal.
The patient's abdominal pain resolved with bowel rest. He
resumed a regular diet without recurrence of discomfort. His
vital signs were stable and he was afebrile. His white blood
cell count normalized. He was ambulatory and voiding without
difficulty.

___ EGD:
Impression: Thickening and congestion of gastric folds in the 
cardia and proximal body stomach body
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 

___ EUS:
Impression: EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 
___ MHz frequency: The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged 
from the duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body 
and tail [partially] were imaged from the gastric body and 
fundus. .
Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma in the uncinate, head and 
body of the pancreas was homogenous, with a normal salt and 
pepper appearance. No changes of chr pancreatitis were noted. 
The parenchyma in the tail of the pancreas was obscured by the 
cystic mass.
Pancreas duct: The pancreas duct measured 3 mm in maximum 
diameter in the head of the pancreas and 1.7 mm in maximum 
diameter in the body of the pancreas. The duct was normal in 
echotexture and contour. The duct was not seen in the tail of 
the pancreas.
In the region of the body of the pancreas there was > 3 cm 
ill-defined hypoechoic area. Several areas of air were noted 
within this structure - this caused artifact / shadowing and 
therefore this was very poorly imaged with EUS. The gastric wall 
in this area was markedly expanded. No discrete mass or cyst was 
noted.
Small varices were noted in the gastric cardia
Otherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with history of necrotizing pancreatitis s/p cyst 
jejunostomy was transferred from OSH and admitted to the General 
Surgical Service. The OSH CT scan was concerning for perigastric 
fluid collection and Gastroenterology was consulted for EGD/EUS. 
On admission patient was afebrile with slightly elevated WBCs. 
Patient's WBC returned within normal limit on HD 2 without any 
intervention. He was noticed to have thrombocytopenia and HIT 
panel was checked and returned back negative. On HD 3 patient 
underwent EGD and EUS. EGD revealed thickening and congestion of 
gastric folds in the cardia and proximal body stomach body. EUS 
revealed pancreatic body cyst, normal pancreatic ducts, no 
significant fluid collection (please see Radiology report for 
details). Post procedure patient's diet was advanced to clears 
and was well tolerated. On HD 4, diet was advanced to regular, 
patient remained afebrile with WBC within normal, pain free. 
Patient was discharged home in stable condition. 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Presyncopal episode: presyncopal episode while standing after 
dinner in the setting of nasal congestion x 2 weeks.  While 
intermittently feeling lightheaded, never felt the sensation of 
being ""weighed down"" previously. Likely related to standing in 
hot kitchen baking in the setting of fatigue and ongoing viral 
illness, as well as taking HCTZ 50mg each of the last two days. 
Troponins stable at 0.04 twice 12 hours apart.  HCTZ dosing was 
decreased from 50mg to 25mg daily.

# Chest pain: intermittent chest discomfort/pressure and 
weightiness without associated shortness of breath or 
diaphoresis. Also reports sensation like a pulled muscle which 
she feels in lower ribs and upper back. ACS seems unlikely given 
clinical history, although patient did receive an aspirin 325mg 
in the ED. It is possible that patient could have a post-viral 
pericarditis leading to her positive troponin. Of note, ECG did 
not show PR depressions. Troponins stable at 0.04 twice 12 hours 
apart.

# Nasal congestion: states she often gets viral URI in ___. 
Asked patient to discontinue Afrin since she may be having 
rebound congestion after taking it for more than 3 days.  Asked 
her to consider flonase and/or nasal saline for symptomatic 
relief as needed.

# BLE edema: Stable, decreased HCTZ from 50mg to 25mg daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure participating in your care at ___.  You were 
admitted for an episode of almost fainting, lightheadedness, and

reassuring.  

Please take a decreased dose of your hydrochlorothiazide from 
50mg to 25mg daily as needed for your leg swelling.

Please stop taking Afrin since it may cause your congestion to 
get worse after 3 days, and try Flonase or nasal saline spray.  
You can also take constipation medications as needed.

- MRCP does not show an acute obstruction
- MRCP more consistent with an acute hepatitis, along with lab 
studies, however it is quite likely that he passed a stone as 
well
- His viral hepatitis serologies are still pending at time of 
discharge, and should be followed up by his PCP.
- Autoimmune hepatitis labs are pending at time of discharge, 
and should be followed up by his PCP.
- The ERCP team was consulted, and after MRCP results, felt that 
there was no indication for ERCP, given lack of obstruction
- No clear etiology for hepatitis, although acute viral would be 
most concerning. Also note anemia and leukopenia, which would be 
more concerning for acute viral hepatitis
- Scant ascites and paracholecystic fluid, along with sludge 
previously seen, make an evaluation by a general surgeon for 
eventual cholecystectomy a recommendation for the outpatient

Pt is a ___ man with h/o AAA s/p open repair ___, h/o bleeding 
gastric ulcer s/p partial gastrectomy, p/w melena and anemia. 
Initially developed melena ___ AM, with associated 
lightheadedness, and then BRBPR ___ night. Yesterday AM went 
to OSH after speaking with PCP. There, initial CBC showed Hct 24 
(? baseline 30), so received 2units PRBCs with repeat Hct 25, so 
got an additional 4units PRBCs. EGD there reportedly showed 
bleeding at gastrojejunal anastamosis but no active visible site 
to treat. Colonoscopy was also attempted, which reportedly 
showed red blood to the ascending colon, but pt became 
bradycardic requiring atropine, so the procedure was aborted.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with hx HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD, presented from 
___ with complaints of 1 day of fevers, and he was 
found to have significantly elevated LFTs which was concerning 
for biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and cholestatic hepatitis. 
 Pt underwent ERCP, where he was found to have a 10 mm filling 
defect in the distal CBD c/w choledocolithiasis and associated 
pus was noted.  The pt underwent sphincterotomy and biliary 
stent placement.  The stone was NOT removed from the duct, given 
the patient's active cholangitis and he had a desaturation to 
the 50's which required brief intubation.  He was treated with 
IV ciprofloxacin and flagyl during the hospitalization, and he 
will continue oral antibiotics for 2 weeks for his cholangitis, 
given the stone remaining in his bile duct.  He will undergo 
repeat ERCP on ___, with stone extraction.  His 
Lovastatin is currently being held due to his elevated LFT's, 
and this should be resumed once his LFT's normalize. 
 
  
Coagulopathy, NOS  
Pt was noted to have a mild coagulopathy of unclear etiology.  
Possibly due to above liver disease.  He was provided an Vitamin 
K challenge, without improvement in his coagulation profile.  
Please consider rechecking coags at follow up.

HTN: 
Pt was continued on atenolol, but his HCTZ and irbesartan were 
held during the admission given his acute infection. These were 
resumed at the time of discharge.

Cardiac Cath (___)
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system 
demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no 
angiographically 
apparent disease. The LAD had a ___ mid vessel stenosis. The 
Cx had a 
100% mid vessel thrombotic occlusion. The RCA had a ___ mid 
vessel 
stenosis. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic 
pressure of 
132.86 mmHg. 
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid Cx with a 2.25x8mm 
INTEGRITY 
stent which was postdilated to 2.75mm. Final angiography 
revealed no 
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and 
TIMI II 
to III flow (see ___ comments). 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid Cx woth a BMS. 

Bedside TTE (___)
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed 
(LVEF= 15X %). with depressed free wall contractility. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

CXR (___)
Wide spread bilateral dense reticular opacities with relative 
left lower lung and right mid lung sparing, likely representing 
flash pulmonary edema due to acute cardiac decompensation in the 
setting of ischemia/infarct. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with history of HTN, dCHF, severe AS, HLD who presented 
from ___ with chest pain due to STEMI
.
#. STEMI/CAD - EKG at ___ concerning for STEMI, transferred 
here for cardiac cath.  Pt went straight to cath lab, was found 
have an occluded LCX, and had a BMS deployed with good 
restoration of flow.  She had no previous history of coronary 
artery disease and a recent echo did not show any evidence of 
wall motion abnormality or significant valvular disease.  
Arrived to CCU for further observation following procedure.  She 
shortly thereafter developed worsening oxygen requirement.  Stat 
CXR was performed which showed significant bilateral pulmonary 
edema, likely flash pulmonary edema from acute cardiac 
decompensation.  Patient had initially said that she did not 
want to be intubated, but wanted to have cardiac resuscitation.  
Upon seeing CXR results, her son/HCP was immediately called to 
discuss new findings and what this might represent.  In light of 
the fact that she had just undergone cardiac cath, the thought 
that what was going on was likely ___ her STEMI and potentially 
reversible if we pursued intubation and aggressive diuresis.  
Code status was reversed from DNI to full code.  As patient's 
respiratory status worsened, she became more bradycardic and 
more hypotensive.  Anesthesia was called for elective 
intubation, however patient quickly became hemodynamically 
stable.  Dopamine, then levophed were started peripherally as 
patient did not have central access.  Stat bedside TTE was 
performed to evaluate valves as she just had STEMI.  Mitral 
valve was widely regurgitant, which is acutely changed from the 
TTE she had at ___ a few weeks ago.  Patient continued to 
become more bradycardic, transcutaneous pacing was started.  
Hemodynamics and respiratory status worsened.  Code blue was 
called.  On holding transcutaneous pacing, patient was shown to 
be in PEA arrest.  Patient was coded with CPR, a total of 5 
rounds of epinephrine, 3 rounds of atropine, 2 rounds of bicarb, 
1 round of vasopressin.  CCU and interventional attending was 
called, decision was made not to bring patient back to the cath 
lab.  Pulse could not be recovered at any point during the code. 
 After 14 minutes, decision was made to stop code.  Time of 
death was 9:04 ___ on ___.  Family was present and updated 
by the CCU team, they declined autopsy.  Medical examiner waived 
autopsy as well.

101.5 F, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, or inability to 
urinate, call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.

 

The operation you have experienced is a ""scraping"" operation. 
Bleeding was controlled with electrocautery which has produced a 
""scab"" in the channel through which the urine passes (the 
urethra). About ___ weeks after the operation, pieces of the 
scab will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs, 
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry 
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a 
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. If bleeding 
occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear 
impairing your stream, call your surgeon. Because of the 
potential for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) should be avoided for 
the first 3 weeks after surgery.

You will be given a prescription for antibiotics to be taken for 
a few days after surgery. This is to help prevent infection. If 
you develop a fever over 101°, chills, or pain in the testicles, 
call your surgeon. Although not common, this may indicate 
infection that has developed beyond the control of the 
antibiotics that you have taken.

*** Call Dr. ___ office to schedule followup appointment 
for removal of catheter in 1 week.

scab will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs,
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. If bleeding
occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear
impairing your stream, call your surgeon. Because of the
potential for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) should be avoided for
the first 3 weeks after surgery.
You will be given a prescription for antibiotics to be taken for
a few days after surgery. This is to help prevent infection. If
you develop a fever over 101°, chills, or pain in the testicles,
call your surgeon. Although not common, this may indicate
infection that has developed beyond the control of the
antibiotics that you have taken.
*** Call Dr. ___ office to schedule followup appointment

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
POD#0, the patient had to be straight catheterized for a bladder 
scan over 500 mL. Overnight, patient was given Flomax x 1 for 
urinary retention.
POD #1, patient was voiding independently.  Drain was removed.  
Ultrasound was performed for worsening calf pain.  This showed 
no evidence of blood clots.  He was also given a one-time dose 
of oral Hydralazine for an elevated BP of 189/74 with 
appropriate effect. 
POD #2, BPs remained stable 130-140s/60s.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Aspirin 325 mg twice 
daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The 
surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision 
was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs 
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with no range of motion 
restrictions.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:

TTE ___

The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no left ventricular outflow 
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber 
size is normal with borderline normal free wall function. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly 
directed jet of mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Preserved left ventricular function. Borderline 
normal right ventricular function. Mild to moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Normal pulmonary 
pressure. 

CTA chest with contrast ___

IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli, with evidence of filling defects 
within the
very distal aspect of the right main pulmonary artery, as well 
as the
segmental and subsegmental branches of the right upper lobe, 
right lower lobe,
left lower lobe, and left upper lobe. There is no evidence of 
right heart
strain.
2. Linear opacity in the right lower lung lobe, which may 
represent
atelectasis versus possible developing pulmonary infarct.
3. Focal fluid collection measuring 8.4 x 3.5 cm anteriorly 
along the
right-sided pleural space adjacent to the sternotomy site, 
compatible with
likely postoperative serum.

.
Mrs ___ was admitted for IV hydration and antiemetics due to 
her persistent nausea and vomiting. Labs were significant for 
elevated transaminases, (ALT 140 and AST 91), otherwise labs 
were normal. She had normal platelets and no evidence of 
preeclampsia/HELLP. A RUQ ultrasound was negative for 
gallbladder or liver abnormalities. Repeat LFTs were slightly 
improved with ALT 133 and AST 62. Although she had normal blood 
pressures (90/50), a 24 hour urine was collected to rule out 
preeclampsia as she had elevated LFTs and RUQ pain.
.
By HD#2, she was able to tolerate pos and was feeling better. 
LFTs continued to trend downward. Hepatology was consulted and 
felt that her nausea/vomiting from a viral illness was the 
likely etiology of her transaminitis and recommended repeating 
labs in one week. The 24 hour urine was negative.
.
Fetal testing was reassuring during this admissison and she had 
no preterm contractions. The NICU was consulted. 
.
She was discharged home on hospital day #3 and will have close 
outpatient followup.

.
Mrs ___ was admitted for IV hydration and antiemetics due to
her persistent nausea and vomiting. Labs were significant for
elevated transaminases, (ALT 140 and AST 91), otherwise labs
were normal. She had normal platelets and no evidence of
preeclampsia/HELLP. A RUQ ultrasound was negative for
gallbladder or liver abnormalities. Repeat LFTs were slightly
improved with ALT 133 and AST 62. Although she had normal blood
pressures (90/50), a 24 hour urine was collected to rule out
preeclampsia as she had elevated LFTs and RUQ pain.
.
By HD#2, she was able to tolerate pos and was feeling better.
LFTs continued to trend downward. Hepatology was consulted and
felt that her nausea/vomiting from a viral illness was the
likely etiology of her transaminitis and recommended repeating
labs in one week. The 24 hour urine was negative.
.
Fetal testing was reassuring during this admissison and she had
no preterm contractions. The NICU was consulted.
.
She was discharged home on hospital day #3 and will have close
outpatient followup.

FINDINGS:  
  
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast 
attenuation.   
  
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.   
  
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the 
left ventricular myocardium.  
  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 81% with an 
EDV of 55 ml.  
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 
  
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented to ___ and Delivery at 38 weeks 4 days 
with fever, maternal & fetal tachycardia, leukocytosis and 
diffuse abdominal TTP consistent with chorioamnionitis. She 
denied any significant GI symptoms and did not recall rupture of 
membranes. She was immediately started on IV fluids, and 
ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin for presumed 
chorioamnionitis and given antipyretics. The fetal heart rate 
decreased slightly from 200s to the 180s to 170s but given 
persistent fetal tachycardia despite significant intrauterine 
resuscitation, the recommendation was made to proceed with 
cesarean section given the duration of the category 2 fetal 
heart tracing was unknown, and the patient was remote from 
delivery with the cervix 1 cm dilated.  

Postpartum, blood cultures returned with gram positive cocci in 
chains on postpartum day #1, later speciating as group B 
streptococcus, pan-sensitive. Infectious Disease was consulted 
and recommended transition to IV pencillin which was started on 
postpartum day #1. Given inability to rule-out endocarditis as 
the source of infection, echocardiogram was obtained revealing 
mild biatrial enlargement without massess or vegitations, mild 
pulmonary hypertension and LEVF of > 55%. She remained afebrile 
throughout the course of her hospitalization. Daily blood 
cultures were obtained. She received IV pencillin until 
discharge on postpartum day #4. Per Infectious Disease, as daily 
blood cultures revealed no growth to date up to the day of 
planned discharge, no further antibiotics were indicated after 
discharge as the source of infection had been removed.

She otherwise received routine postpartum care. She was 
discharged on postpartum day #4 in stable condition. She was 
afebrile and hemodynamically stable at the time of discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented to ___ and Delivery at 38 weeks 4 days
with fever, maternal & fetal tachycardia, leukocytosis and
diffuse abdominal TTP consistent with chorioamnionitis. She
denied any significant GI symptoms and did not recall rupture of
membranes. She was immediately started on IV fluids, and
ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin for presumed
chorioamnionitis and given antipyretics. The fetal heart rate
decreased slightly from 200s to the 180s to 170s but given
persistent fetal tachycardia despite significant intrauterine
resuscitation, the recommendation was made to proceed with
cesarean section given the duration of the category 2 fetal
heart tracing was unknown, and the patient was remote from
delivery with the cervix 1 cm dilated.
Postpartum, blood cultures returned with gram positive cocci in
chains on postpartum day #1, later speciating as group B
streptococcus, pan-sensitive. Infectious Disease was consulted
and recommended transition to IV pencillin which was started on
postpartum day #1. Given inability to rule-out endocarditis as
the source of infection, echocardiogram was obtained revealing
mild biatrial enlargement without massess or vegitations, mild
pulmonary hypertension and LEVF of > 55%. She remained afebrile
throughout the course of her hospitalization. Daily blood
cultures were obtained. She received IV pencillin until
discharge on postpartum day #4. Per Infectious Disease, as daily
blood cultures revealed no growth to date up to the day of
planned discharge, no further antibiotics were indicated after
discharge as the source of infection had been removed.
She otherwise received routine postpartum care. She was
discharged on postpartum day #4 in stable condition. She was
afebrile and hemodynamically stable at the time of discharge.
