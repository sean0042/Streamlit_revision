You were admitted post-operatively following your ganglion cyst 
removal from your right lower extermity.

Activity: weight bearing as tolerated to right lower extremity 
with crutches or walker for balance and protection as needed. Be 
sure to keep your leg elevated and place ice on the surgical 
area to help with swelling and pain relief.
Anticoagulation: Please take aspirin 325 mg two times daily for

Antibiotics: Please take the prescribed antibiotic (Keflex ___ 
mg 4x/day)as directed while your drain is in place to help

Dressing/wound care: Please keep your dressing clean and dry at 
all times. It may be easier to sponge bath in the short term 
until your dressing is removed. Cover your dressing with a 
waterproof barrier whenever bathing to keep it dry.
Drain: The drain will remain in place until the output has 
decreased to avoid fluid from collecting at the surgical site. 
Please measure the output of the drain daily and bring it to 
your next appointment so we can make a decision as to whether or 
not to remove the drain then.
Urine output: During your hospital stay your urine output was on 
the low end of normal. This was likely from a combination of not 
drinking as much as usual and irritation of your prostate from 
the foley catheder during the surgery. We expect that this will 
improve over the next ___ hours, but please make sure to note 
any signs that you are not urinating as much as usual or if it 
seems to be difficult to urinate. If you have any concerns 
please go to the emergency room to be evaluated for urinary 
retention, which sometimes occurs after surgery.

little cervical change. An intrauterine pressure catheter was
placed and her MVUs were noted to be greater than 250. After
two hours of no cervical change with adequate contractions, the
decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.
Her delivery was uncomplicated and then patient was transferred
to the postpartum floor. Initially her blood pressures were
noted to be elevated and she was started on Labetalol 100mg BID. Her blood pressures then normalized and the Labetalol was
discontinued on POD#1. On POD#4, her blood pressures started to
increase again. Another set HELLP labs were noted to be within
normal limits. Labetalol 200mg TID was restarted. Blood
pressure improved.
The patient remained in the hospital for one additional night to
closely monitor her blood pressure. On POD#5, she was
discharged home in stable condition with follow up in 2 weeks
and 6 weeks.

early ___. By report, this was essentially healed. However, a
few days after returning to work he noted progressively
worsening swelling and tenderness. He was readmitted on ___ to
the OSH, where he underwent additional debridement and was
treated with IV Vancomycin and Zosyn. Wound cultures from the
OSH were positive for Corynebacterium during his inital
hospitalization and there is question of enterococcus from the
recent wound debridement on ___, though I don't see the
official report in the transfer documentation. He has had 2
MRI's at the OSH during this infection, both of which were
negative for osteomyelitis, the report from ___ is in the
chart. A bone scan was also done on ___ at the OSH, which did
not show uptake/osteo in the L forefoot. He has remained
afebrile and denies subjective fevers or chills. He had a PICC
placed on ___ at the OSH for anticipated long term antibiotics.
Other than the foot infection, he has been feeling healthy and
well.

4. Gestational diabetes.
5. Hypothyroidism.

DISCHARGE MEDICATION:  Prenatal vitamins.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Is to follow up in ___ in
3 days for platelet count assessment.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is approximately 33
weeks pregnant and has noticed over the previous 48 hours
that she was unable to urinate with a lot of lower abdominal
pain, and still continued inability to urinate.  The patient
has a history of multiple sclerosis.  Has not had a flare in
___ years.  Was mainly optic involvement with the previous
flare.  The patient also is currently with IVF donor egg
pregnancy and was noted at approximately 26 weeks to have
severe idiopathic thrombocytopenia with platelet counts at
times getting as low as 18,000.  The patient was receiving
approximately every 2 weeks IgG therapy for 2 days which
would cause a temporary bump in her platelet count. The
patient also had some borderline insulin resistance from the
steroids that she was on for ITP.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a catheter inserted which
was drained for 1.5 L of urine, and the catheter was left in
place.  An attempt the next day was made to do a voiding
trial.  The patient was continuing to have an inability to
urinate, so the catheter was replaced again for another L of
urine. Hematology consulted as well as Neurology.  MRI was
done, which had some new lesions in the thoracic part of the
spine that had not been on previous MRIs that had been done
at an outside institution.  Neurology was consulted, and
after urine culture was negative, and no other finding, the
decision was made that this was most likely due to an MS
flare, and different therapeutic options were considered.
The patient also had a low platelet count at the time of 20
k, and so was in need of her IgG therapy for her
thrombocytopenia.  After receiving 2 days of an IgG therapy
intravenous Neurology suggested that we continue the IgG for
another 3 days for a total 5 days to help treat her MS flare.
So she received 5 days of IgG therapy and her platelet count
went up to over 200,000, and a voiding trial on the ___ was successful, and the patient was able to successfully
void.  She also reported fewer restless leg movements and
twitching in her lower extremities from this.  After 24 hours
the patient was voiding well with no evidence of retained
urine or bladder dysfunction, and so the patient was
discharged to home.  At the time on ___ bedside
ultrasound showed good fetal well being.  With a good fetal
heart rate tracing that was reactive, and good amniotic
fluid, and an EFW that was the ___ percentile.  The patient
was to follow up in ___, as well as ___,
as well as general obstetrician's  clinic.  The patient will
follow up with her neurologist at ___ after discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___, gravida 1, para 0, who presented to 
labor and delivery at 37 weeks' and 1 day gestation.  Of note, 
her pregnancy course had been complicated by multiple sclerosis 
and ITP.  For her ITP she had been followed by the Hematology 
service.  She was maintained on steroids and IVIG infusions.  
She presented at 3 cm of dilation.  She quickly progressed to 9 
cm, 100% effaced and a +1 station.  Her platelets were 82 on 
arrival. Given that she had a history of precipitous drops in 
her platelets after IVIG infusions, the Anesthesia service felt 
it would not be recommended to place an epidural catheter for 
her.  They recommended doing a fentanyl PCA and considering 
spinal.  When she progressed rapidly to 9 cm, decision was made 
to place a spinal for anesthesia during delivery.  A spinal was 
placed and she initially had good relief.  After the effect of 
the spinal had dissipated she was then switched to remifentanil 
PCA while pushing. She pushed for 3 hours with minimal descent 
of the fetal head.   After 3 hours in the ___ stage, she was 
counseled that she had made minimal progress, and a primary 
cesarean section was recommended for delivery. She agreed to 
proceed with a primary cesarean section.  She understood that 
the C-section would proceed under a general anesthetic due to 
her low platelet count.  Prior to the C- section her platelets 
were rechecked and were 77.  All consents were signed prior to 
the procedure. She delivered a liveborn male infant on 
___. Please see operative note for details. She was 
transferred to the postpartum floor in stable condition.

She was followed by hematology postpartum. She received stress 
dose steroids for her ITP followed by her home prednisone dose. 
Platelets were trended. She had nadir of 11K platelets PPD2 and 
received IVIG x 2 and platelet transfusion with appropriate rise 
in platelets to 105k. She had a recurrence of urinary retention 
of 1600cc on ___ consistent with history of multiple 
sclerosis flare. Urology was consulted and recommended foley for 
7 days with follow up trial of void at that time. Her primary 
neurologist was following her during her hospital stay and 
recommended IVIG for 5 days from ___. 

For her gestational hypertension, her blood pressures were in 
the non-severe range without symptoms of pre-clampsia and did 
not require antihypertensive medication. 

She was discharged home in stable condition on postpartum day 9

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___, gravida 1, para 0, who presented to
labor and delivery at 37 weeks' and 1 day gestation. Of note,
her pregnancy course had been complicated by multiple sclerosis
and ITP. For her ITP she had been followed by the Hematology
service. She was maintained on steroids and IVIG infusions.
She presented at 3 cm of dilation. She quickly progressed to 9
cm, 100% effaced and a +1 station. Her platelets were 82 on
arrival. Given that she had a history of precipitous drops in
her platelets after IVIG infusions, the Anesthesia service felt
it would not be recommended to place an epidural catheter for
her. They recommended doing a fentanyl PCA and considering
spinal. When she progressed rapidly to 9 cm, decision was made
to place a spinal for anesthesia during delivery. A spinal was
placed and she initially had good relief. After the effect of
the spinal had dissipated she was then switched to remifentanil
PCA while pushing. She pushed for 3 hours with minimal descent
of the fetal head. After 3 hours in the ___ stage, she was
counseled that she had made minimal progress, and a primary
cesarean section was recommended for delivery. She agreed to
proceed with a primary cesarean section. She understood that
the C-section would proceed under a general anesthetic due to
her low platelet count. Prior to the C- section her platelets
were rechecked and were 77. All consents were signed prior to
the procedure. She delivered a liveborn male infant on
___. Please see operative note for details. She was
transferred to the postpartum floor in stable condition.
She was followed by hematology postpartum. She received stress
dose steroids for her ITP followed by her home prednisone dose.
Platelets were trended. She had nadir of 11K platelets PPD2 and
received IVIG x 2 and platelet transfusion with appropriate rise
in platelets to 105k. She had a recurrence of urinary retention
of 1600cc on ___ consistent with history of multiple
sclerosis flare. Urology was consulted and recommended foley for
7 days with follow up trial of void at that time. Her primary
neurologist was following her during her hospital stay and
recommended IVIG for 5 days from ___.
For her gestational hypertension, her blood pressures were in
the non-severe range without symptoms of pre-clampsia and did
not require antihypertensive medication.
She was discharged home in stable condition on postpartum day 9

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with left leg pain in the L4 
or L5 distribution.  This has been going on for about five to 
six weeks now.  She also has weakness and she keeps tripping on 
the left foot.  The pins and needles.  The pain is so bad that 
she had to visit the local emergency room at one time. Her exam 
overall shows mild weakness of the left ___ 4+ to ___. Also, 
inversion of the left foot is slightly weak as well as TA on the 
left.  Rest is full.  Sensory is reduced on the left L4 and L5 
distribution to pinprick.  SLR is positive on the left for 
primarily L4 and also some L5 distribution pain.  Hip seems to 
be okay.  The MRI of her lumbar spine from a few weeks ago was 
reviewed.  It is significant for severe lateral recess stenosis 
at the left L4-L5 area, which is a result of disc bulging as 
well as ligamentous hypertrophy.  That is probably affecting the 
L5 nerve root causing the weakness an  probably the majority of 
the pain.  There is also a far lateral L4-L5 disc herniation, 
which is also contacting the left L4 nerve root after its exit 
from the canal and may also be responsible for the L4 type 
distribution. Reflexes on the other hand are 2+ in both knees 
and 1+ in both Achilles, which is indicating no severe L4 
compression.  However, the patient and her husband request to 
explore the L4 nerve root and we are going to proceed with an 
L4-L5 microdiscectomy sooner than later due to the weakness.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service on 
___ with a right tibial plateau fracture. The patient was 
taken to the operating room and underwent  ORIF of his right 
tibial plateau fracture. Patient tolerated the procedure without 
difficulty and was transferred to the PACU, then the floor in 
stable condition. Please see operative report for full details.

Musculoskeletal:  After procedure, patient's weight-bearing 
status was transitioned to non-weight bearing, then he was 
liberalized to touchdown weight bearing. Throughout the 
hospitalization, patient worked with physical therapy and was 
given detailed instructions regarding post-discharge exercise 
and the appropriate weight-bearing progression.

Neuro: post-operatively, patient's pain was controlled by IV 
pain medications and was subsequently transitioned to oxycodone 
with good effect and adequate pain control. Early in his 
hospitalization (___) he was actively withdrawing from 
alcohol with hallucinations, agitation, and hemodynamic changes. 
 The medicine team was consulted, and he was given ativan, 
haldol, and hydralazine per their recommendations, with good 
effect.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.  He was initially 
hypertensive in the setting of alcohol withdrawal, but good 
blood pressure control was maintained when he was restarted on 
his home medications per medical consult recommendation.

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI/GU:  A po diet was tolerated well. Patient was also started 
on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement. Intake and 
output were closely monitored.

patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of 
infection.  He had no signs of active infection throughout the 
hospital stay.

Prophylaxis:  The patient received enoxaparin during this stay, 
and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.

Heme:  The patient had an elevated platelet count approximately 
12 days into his hospitalization, so the hematology oncology 
service was consulted. Further laboratory evaluation did not 
reveal a cause for his elevated platelets, but they were 
starting to trend down prior to discharge and the patient is 
scheduled to follow up with hematology/oncology as an 
outpatient.

At the time of discharge on ___ POD #16, the patient was 
doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a 
regular diet, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The incision was clean, dry, and intact without 
evidence of erythema or drainage; the extremity was NVI distally 
throughout.  The patient was given written instructions 
concerning precautionary instructions and the appropriate 
follow-up care.  The patient will be continued on chemical DVT 
prophylaxis for 6 weeks post-discharge (aspirin).  All questions 
were answered prior to discharge and the patient expressed 
readiness for discharge.  He was given a plan for ___ progression 
(1) Touch down weight bearing right lower extremity until 
___.  Unlocked ___ with full range of motion and 
quadricep strengthening.
2) Advance to partial (50%) weight bearing 8 weeks 
post-operatively (___).  ___ discontinue knee immobilizer at

for complete details.

Patient was extubated slowly given the CO2 issues intra-op and 
patient's response to CO2 insufflation observed during surgery.  
Post-operatively, the decision was made to admit the patient 
overnight for observation-- she had difficulty opening her right 
eye due to a corneal abrasion and the patient had emphysema 
related to the CO2 gas. She was monitored on telemetry without 
any issues. Her pain was controlled with PO 
oxycodone/ibuprofen/acetaminophen. Her diet was advanced to 
regular. She was given erythromycin ointment by the anesthesia 
team.  We also presecribed artificial tears given the patient's 
right eye discomfort.  

She remained stable overnight without desaturation on telemetry. 
A CBC and chemistry were checked the morning of POD1, and found 
to be within normal limits. She was ambulating without 
difficulty, tolerating a regular diet, voiding urine without 
difficulty. She was discharged home in stable condition with 
outpatient follow up scheduled.

intake prior to running and felt dehydrated after the marathon. 
Since that time, she has had persistent abdominal and right 
flank pain requiring narcotic pain medication.  

Outpatient workup including, CTU, abdominal CT and MRI were 
unremarkable. She is therefore admitted to the hospital for PICC

shortly after completing a marathon about a month ago. Extensive 
outpatient workup including CTU, abdominal CT and MRI revealed 
no structural etiology of the pain.  We felt the pain was from 
hypoperfusion during a low-flow state when she was dehydrated 
during and after a marathon causing ischemia of the right colon. 
 

She is admitted to the hospital for further evaluation including 
PICC line placement and TPN secondary to severe malnutrition.  
She has had a > 5% loss in body weight over 1 month and  < 50% 
energy intake compared to estimated energy needs for > 5days.   

By hospital day 3, the pain and nausea had not improved despite 
being NPO so she was taken for an  exploratory laparoscopy, 
retroperitoneal pericaval lymph node removal, laparoscopic 
appendectomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, and pelvic 
inflammatory process culture and biopsy.  After the procedure, 
her pain level substantially improved.  She started to slowly 
take small amounts of po liquids without an increase in pain so 
that by hospital day 7, she was ready to be discharged to home.

Discharge Instructions:
Dr ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.  You were 
admitted to with a one month history of crampy abdominal and 
flank pain with weight loss.  Outpatient workup including CTU, 
abdominal CT and MRI were negative. We felt the pain was 
secondary to hypoperfusion during a low-flow state from 
dehydrated during and after a marathon which caused ischemia of 
the right colon.  We placed a PICC line and started TPN.  

Despite bowel rest, your abdominal pain persisted.  You then 
underwent a laparoscopy abdominal exploration.   During the 
procedure, we removed adhesions, a lymph node and your appendix. 
 We also sent multiple samples to the lab for further analysis.  
  

You tolerated the procedure well and are now ready to be 
discharge to home.  We will keep your PICC in place and continue 
TPN at home on a nightly basis.  You are now being discharged 
home with the following instructions:

Please follow up at the appointment in clinic listed below. We 
also generally recommend that patients follow up with their 
primary care provider after having surgery. 

ACTIVITY:
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs.
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL:
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" a couple weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You could have a poor appetite for a couple days. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.

YOUR INCISION:
You may shower and remove the gauzes over your incisions. Under 
these dressings you have small plastic bandages called 
steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are 
the thin paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if 
they fall off before that that's okay.
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.

YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"".
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. Do not 
take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed. Do not drink alcohol or 
drive while taking narcotic pain medication.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.

edema resulting in partial airway obstruction and respiratory 
distress. On admission, she felt that her respiratory status was 
at baseline and fiberoptic exam by ENT demonstrated widely 
patent airway. No additional symptomatology to suggest 
influenza, mononucleosis or primary HIV. No known caustic 
ingestions on inhalant abuse. No history of symptoms consistent 
with GERD. Paroxysmal vocal cord movement considered although 
atypical to present with prominent sore throat rather than 
respiratory distress, throat tightening.

although potentially exacerbating factor in the setting acute 
process. 

A throat culture was sent from the emergency department, though 
was not complete at the time of discharge.

The patient was started on Decadrom 10mg IV q 8 hours x 2 doses 
and then switched to an oral Medrol dose pack.  She was started

fetal demise of quadruplet A was also noted at that time. There 
was no evidence of infection or abruption on presentation. After 
counseling regarding her options for management, she elected to 
initially proceed with expectant management. However, given the 
poor prognosis for carrying the remaining fetuses to viability, 
and the imminent delivery of quadruplet A, the decision was made 
to give cytotec to facilitate delivery. She subsequently 
delivered all four quadruplets via vaginal delivery, with 
spontaneous delivery of the placenta afterward. Rhogam was 
administered for Rh negative blood type, and she was seen by 
both the chaplain and social work during her hospitalization. 
Prophylactic antibiotics were administered for 24 hours

Chief Complaint:
Diplopia, headache
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
LP
 
History of Present Illness:
___ yo man with PMH significant only for B 12 deficiency
who presents with three days of R facial and retroorbital pain.
He states having difficulty keeping his eyes open as well as
significant horizontal diplopia when looking to the right. He
presented to ___ where brain MRI was initially
read as R cavernous sinus mass with no thrombosis and 
transferred
here for neurosurgical evaluation.

Significant findings on exam include: decreased sensation to PP
and LT in the Right V1 and V2 distribution as well as a marked
___ nerve palsy on the Right.

I reviewed his MRI which seems to show a uniformly enhancing 
mass
in the right cavernous sinus extensing into the superior orbital
fissure. It looks somewhat suspicious for a meningioma given its
robust enhancement (although a dural tail is not evident).

The official radiology read is as follows: 
Mass lesion in the right cavernous sinus extending to the right 
foramen ovale region. The differential diagnosis includes
meningioma or hemangioma of the cavernous sinus, inflammatory
lesion such as ___ syndrome or neoplastic lesion such as
metastasis or lymphoma. The enhancement pattern and signal
characteristics favor inflammatory lesion versus metastasis 
or lymphoma. Clinical correlation is recommended with any
nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal lesion, which could produce
perineural spread and metastatic disease. Correlation with
patient's onset of symptoms and other findings would also be
helpful in differential diagnosis.

fissure. It looks somewhat suspicious for a meningioma given its
robust enhancement (although a dural tail is not evident).
The official radiology read is as follows:
Mass lesion in the right cavernous sinus extending to the right
foramen ovale region. The differential diagnosis includes
meningioma or hemangioma of the cavernous sinus, inflammatory
lesion such as ___ syndrome or neoplastic lesion such as
metastasis or lymphoma. The enhancement pattern and signal
characteristics favor inflammatory lesion versus metastasis
or lymphoma. Clinical correlation is recommended with any
nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal lesion, which could produce
perineural spread and metastatic disease. Correlation with
patient's onset of symptoms and other findings would also be
helpful in differential diagnosis.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old healthy female who had a screening
colonoscopy earlier today at about 10am. Hot snare polypectomies
were performed in the cecum x 2 and at the splenic flexure. A
cold biopsy forceps was used in the descending colon. Per the GI
physician, the colon was tortuous but the prep was good and the
colonoscopy was relatively straightforward. No concerns during
the procedure itself.

She felt discomfort in the recovery area but improved and was
sent home. She was visiting a family member in the hospital 
later
in the day but felt unwell with abdominal discomfort and went
home. She had low grade temperatures at home. The pain continued
to worsen and she presented to the ED for evaluation. Plain film
on arrival is negative for free air. 

Labs are significant for a WBC of 14 with a lactate of 1.5,
otherwise normal. CT scan with IV contrast shows inflammatory
changes in the cecum and ascending colon with stranding and a
small amount of free fluid. No free air or significant amount of
free fluid. 

On my evaluation, the patient describes right lower quadrant
abdominal pain that is worse with movement. Denies nausea,
vomiting. Did have some loose stool earlier in the day. Had a
small amount of PO intake around 12pm. Felt subjective fevers
earlier today. No urinary symptoms.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old healthy female who had a screening
colonoscopy earlier today at about 10am. Hot snare polypectomies
were performed in the cecum x 2 and at the splenic flexure. A
cold biopsy forceps was used in the descending colon. Per the GI
physician, the colon was tortuous but the prep was good and the
colonoscopy was relatively straightforward. No concerns during
the procedure itself.
She felt discomfort in the recovery area but improved and was
sent home. She was visiting a family member in the hospital
later
in the day but felt unwell with abdominal discomfort and went
home. She had low grade temperatures at home. The pain continued
to worsen and she presented to the ED for evaluation. Plain film
on arrival is negative for free air.
Labs are significant for a WBC of 14 with a lactate of 1.5,
otherwise normal. CT scan with IV contrast shows inflammatory
changes in the cecum and ascending colon with stranding and a
small amount of free fluid. No free air or significant amount of
free fluid.
On my evaluation, the patient describes right lower quadrant
abdominal pain that is worse with movement. Denies nausea,
vomiting. Did have some loose stool earlier in the day. Had a
small amount of PO intake around 12pm. Felt subjective fevers
earlier today. No urinary symptoms.

Discharge Condition:

Discharge Instructions:
The operation you have experienced is a ""scraping"" operation; 
that is to say, the bladder tumor or biopsy sample was ""scraped"" 
off the bladder wall. Bleeding was controlled with 
electrocautery which will produce a ""scab"" in the inside bladder 
wall. About ___ weeks after the operation, pieces of the scab 
will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs, 
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry 
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a 
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. Because of this 
tendency for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) must be avoided for 2 
weeks following your operation (Tylenol is okay). If bleeding 
occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear 
impairing your stream, call your urologist.

If you develop a fever over 101°, or have chills, call your 
urologist. Although not common, this may indicate infection that 
has developed beyond the control of the antibiotics that you 
have taken. 

It will take 6 weeks from the date of surgery to fully recover 
from your operation. This can be divided into two parts -- the 
first 2 weeks and the last 4 weeks. During the first 2 weeks 
from the date of your surgery, it is important to be ""a person 
of leisure"". You should avoid lifting and straining, which also 
means that you should avoid constipation. This can be done by 
any of 3 ways: 1) modify your diet, 2) use stool softeners which 
have been prescribed for you, and 3) use gentle laxatives such 
as Milk of Magnesia which can be purchased at your local drug 
store. It is important for you to avoid prolonged sitting. You 
should avoid sexual activity during this time. Also, avoid 
driving. The danger is not so much the driving, but it may delay 
you from urinating if you have the urge; and, ""holding"" urine 
may cause bleeding. If you return to work before 2 weeks, you 
may feel fatigued and require a decreased work load. 

During the second 4 week period of your recovery, you may begin 
regular activity, but only on a graduated basis. For example, 
you may feel well enough to return to work, but you may find it 
easier to begin on a half-day basis. It is common to become 
quite tired in the afternoon, and if such occurs, it is best to 
take a nap! Also, you may begin to drive as well as lift objects 
such as a briefcase, etc. If you are a golfer, you may begin to 
swing a golf club at this time. Sexual activity may be resumed 
during this time, but only on a limited basis. In general, your 
overall activity may be escalated to normal as you progress 
through this second time period, such that by ___ weeks 
following the date of surgery, you should be back to normal 
activity. If you take aspirin as a regular medication, it may be 
resumed at this time.

Finally, call Dr. ___ in one week after your surgery for the 
results of your biopsy and your next appointment

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 5:58 ___ 
FINDINGS: A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears in unchanged. 
The heart 
is probably normal in size but not well imaged because of 
overlapping 
opacities. The aortic arch appears calcified. In the right lung, 
there is 
diffuse mild opacification that is confluent near the base of 
the lung with layering opacity suggesting a substantial pleural 
effusion is likely present.  Increased interstitial 
opacification is also noted along the right mid-to-lower lung. 
In the left lung, mostly aeration is good in the mid to upper 
lungs, but at the left lung base, there is also confluent 
retrocardiac opacity. No definite pleural effusion is seen on 
the left side.  
IMPRESSION: Multifocal opacities, much more extensive in the 
right lung than left, which may represent extensive pneumonia in 
the appropriate clinical setting, including a moderate suspected 
right-sided pleural effusion. 
. 
PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of ___ 6:18 ___   
FINDINGS/IMPRESSION: There are multiple gas distended dilated 
loops of colon measuring up to 11 cm in caliber, concerning for 
colonic obstruction, volvulus, or colonic ileus; CT may be 
considered for further evaluation.   
Findings were discussed with ___ at 6:30 p.m. on 
___ by 
___ over the phone.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 5:58 ___
FINDINGS: A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears in unchanged.
The heart
is probably normal in size but not well imaged because of
overlapping
opacities. The aortic arch appears calcified. In the right lung,
there is
diffuse mild opacification that is confluent near the base of
the lung with layering opacity suggesting a substantial pleural
effusion is likely present. Increased interstitial
opacification is also noted along the right mid-to-lower lung.
In the left lung, mostly aeration is good in the mid to upper
lungs, but at the left lung base, there is also confluent
retrocardiac opacity. No definite pleural effusion is seen on
the left side.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal opacities, much more extensive in the
right lung than left, which may represent extensive pneumonia in
the appropriate clinical setting, including a moderate suspected
right-sided pleural effusion.
.
