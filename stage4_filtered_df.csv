Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with severe CAD s/p CABG x 3. He is not a 
surgical candidate per CT surgery.  
.  
#. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Patient with CAD s/p CABG x 3. Prior 
to transfer from OSH to ___, he underwent cardiac 
catheterization which showed a patent vein graft to the LAD with 
the remaining grafts and native vessels occluded or severely 
diseased. Following the procedure he had persistent chest pain 
despite high dose nitro gtt. He was felt not to be a candidate 
for re-do bypass by the surgeon at the OSH.  An intraaortic 
balloon pump was placed and he was transferred to ___ for 
evaluation by Cardiac Surgery (Dr. ___. On arrival to the 
CCU, he continued to c/o CP but soon thereafter became pain free 
on a heparin gtt, integrilin and a nitro gtt. On HD 3, patient 
spiked a fever to 103.7 with accompanying low flank pain and 
there was concern that this represented an infection of the 
IABP. His IABP was then pulled on HD 4, but given his persistent 
fever cardiac catheterization was postponed and Vancomycin 
started. Patient c/o abdominal pain and a CT abdomen/pelvis was 
obtained after removal of the IABP that demonstrated 
inflammation of his ascending colon so he was started on Flagyl 
& Ciprofloxacin. On HD 6, he became afebrile and all of his 
blood cultures were negative, so his Vancomycin was stopped. He 
was cleared for cardiac catheterization, but his Hct was 20.0 
and the patient refused blood products because of his religious 
beliefs. He subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on 
HD6 with a radial approach to minimize blood loss, but none of 
his lesions were intervenable. He was advised to return for 
repeat cardiac catheterization in approximately 1 month when his 
blood counts improve for a re-attempt. As an inpatient, he was 
maintained on his home Gemfibrozil 600 mg PO BID, Zetia 10mg 
daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Aspirin 325mg daily and 
Metoprolol 12.5mg BID. He was discharged on the above 
medications in addition to Imdur 30mg daily, Toprol XL 50mg 
daily, and Lisinopril 10mg daily. He was scheduled for 
Cardiology and PCP ___.  
.  
#. Fever & Abdominal/Flank pain: Patient with fever, abdomen & 
flank pain on HD3 as noted above. After removal of balloon pump, 
patient had CT abdomen & pelvis that demonstrated thickening of 
the cecum and ascending colon, so his IV Flagyl/Cipro/Vancomycin 
was continued. After the balloon pump was removed, he remained 
pain free and defervesced quickly. His blood cultures remained 
negative and his Vancomycin was held. He was continued on his 
Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl and was discharged to complete a 10 day 
course.
.
#. Anemia: Patient with Hct of 27.8 on admission, that dropped 
to 20.0 by HD 6. This was thought to be ___ hemolysis from the 
balloon pump and from some bleeding at the IABP site. His 
Heparin gtt was held and pneumoboots started. He was found to be 
guaiac positive, but had no e/o frank blood in his stools. U/A 
was negative for blood. CT did not demonstrate an RP bleed or 
free fluid in the abdomen. As the patient is Jehovah's Witness, 
he declined pRBC's, so he was started on Epogen & Ferrous 
Sulfate on HD 5 and monitored closely. He was advised to have an 
outpatient GI work-up for his anemia.
.
#. PUMP: TTE showed distal septal hypokinesis, EF 55%. Patient 
appeared euvolemic on exam without evidence of failure.  He was 
maintained on Metoprolol and Captopril as an inpatient and 
transitioned to long-acting agents as an outpatient. 
.  
#. RHYTHM: Patient was in sinus rhythm, he was monitored on 
telemetry and maintained on Metoprolol.  
.  
#. DIABETES: His home Glyburide and Metformin were held as an 
inpatient in lieu of a humalog sliding scale. A HbA1c was 8.0%.
.  
#. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA: Patient's lipid profile showed 
Cholest-117 Triglyc-161* HDL-31 CHOL/HD-3.8 LDLcalc-54. He was 
continued on Gemfibrozil 600 mg PO BID, Zetia 10mg daily and was 
placed on Atorvastatin 80mg daily.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain and a small 
heart attack.  In the hospital, you were seen by cardiac surgery 
and they determined that you were not a surgical candidate. You 
were also seen by interventional cardiology and they started a 
procedure to reopen a blocked vessel.  Unfortunately, due to 
your low blood count, they did not feel that an opening 
procedure would be safe at this time.  Therefore, we recommended 
that you return in approximately 1 month when your blood counts 
are higher to re-attempt an intervention.

Additionally, in the hospital you had some fevers and abdominal 
pain. A CT was performed that showed inflammation in your colon. 
The surgery team saw you and did not feel that you required 
surgery at this time. You were started on antibiotics and your 
fever and abdominal pain resolved.  You will need to finish six 
more days of antibiotics after your discharge.  

The following medications were STARTED: 
-Isosorbide Mononitrate (IMDUR): This is a NEW medication to 
treat your blood pressure and chest pain
-Metoprolol Succinate (TOPROL XL): This is a NEW medication to 
treat your blood pressure and heart rate. It is intended to 
REPLACE your home Atenolol. 
-LISINOPRIL: This is a NEW medication to treat your blood 
pressure. It is intended to REPLACE your home Quinapril.
-Ferrous Sulfate: This is a NEW medication to treat your anemia.
-Ascorbic Acid (Vit C): This should be taken with the iron and 
will help absorb it
-Ciprofloxacin (CIPRO): This is an antibiotic to treat the 
inflammation in your gut. Please continue to take this 
medication as prescribed until ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male hx of diabetes, schizophrenia, alcoholism, and 
tobacco abuse with EtOH intoxication s/p fall found to have an 
anion gap metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia. Given elevated 
EtOH level, he was placed on a CIWA protocol with diazepam and 
monitored for both elecrolyte abnormalities and refeeding 
syndrome. He remained stable with resolution of his intoxication 
and anion gap metabolic acidosis at the time of discharge.  
  
# EtOH Abuse and r/o Withdrawal: ___ presented to the ED 
intoxicated with a serum EtOH of 385. He was placed on a CIWA 
scale with diazepam 10mg q4h for CIWA > 10. He never showed 
objective evidence of withdrawals during admission. He was also 
given a multivitamin, folate and thiamine. Social work was 
consulted to counsel about his alcohol abuse and housing options 
after discharge from the hospital given that the ___ is 
homeless. His serum and urine toxicology screens were negative. 
His electrolytes were monitored for refeeding syndrome and 
remained within normal limits. The ___ was hemodynamically 
stable with an undetectable ethanol level at the time of 
discharge. He was ___ for alcohol abstinence.
   
# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: 
___ presented with an anion gap of 17. Given lack of ketones 
in the urine and no serum osmolar gap, lactic acidosis in the 
setting of hypovolemia is the most likely etiology. His acidosis 
resolved with IVF.   
   
# Mechanical Fall: ___ was found down, and it is unclear how 
long he had been down. ___ had a minor headache and forehead 
abrasions during his hospitalization but no other evidence of 
trauma. CT head and ___ showed no evidence of fracture. CK 
was within normal limits ruling out rhabdomyolysis.  
  
# Tobacco Abuse: ___ reported smoking cigarettes although he 
did not specify how much. He was treated with a nicotine patch 
during this admission and counseled on smoking cessation. 
  
# Type II Diabetes: Chronic, insulin dependent, poorly 
controlled, type II, complicated. ___ had elevated finger 
sticks in the 200s and was placed on a humalog sliding scale 
during his admission. He was found to have an HbA1c of 9.6%. He 
was discharged on his home medications, metformin and glipizide. 
As an outpatient would advise continuing titration of his 
diabetic medications.
   
#Hypertension: ___ consistently hypertensive while admitted 
with systolics in the ___. His home lisinopril was 
increased from 20mg to 40mg PO DAILY. In addition, he was 
prescribed metoprolol 50mg XL for cardio protection given 
history of an MI.

#Schizophrenia: ___ recieves monthly paliperidone 
injections. He was continued on home trazodone and hydroxyzine.  


TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=======================
- f/u with his PCP
- ___ counseled on alcohol cessation and smoking cessation
- Continue titration of diabetic medications as outpatient given 
elevated ___
- Draft discharge summary faxed to ___ (PCP) on ___ @ 
___ - fax success
CONTACT INFO FOR HIS PCP: NP ___ - ___, note that 
they have a walk in clinic at ___ - 
WALK INS for HOMELESS OK 08:30AM - 11:30 AM. 
   
  
HMED ADD:
On initial admission the ___ was frankly intoxicated with 
lab abnormalities which were severe. As a result he was placed 
in inpatient status expecting it would take at least 48 hours 
(two midnights) to improve labs to baseline, control blood 
sugars and monitor for alcohol withdrawal. However once ___ 
became sober and was able to recount story it was clear he has 
never had alcohol withdrawal before, never had DTs or seizures 
and so was deemed low risk for developing withdrawal seizures. 
Additionally, ___ was not interested in alcohol abstinence 
and so was unlikely to remain sober after discharge, limiting 
utility of monitoring in house for withdrawal. He never had 
evidence of alcohol withdrawal in house. Lastly, patients labs 
improved dramatically with IVFs and time returning to normal on 
subsequent checks. As a result he did not require an additional 
midnight for close monitoring or repeat labs.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male hx of diabetes, schizophrenia, alcoholism, and
tobacco abuse with EtOH intoxication s/p fall found to have an
anion gap metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia. Given elevated
EtOH level, he was placed on a CIWA protocol with diazepam and
monitored for both elecrolyte abnormalities and refeeding
syndrome. He remained stable with resolution of his intoxication
and anion gap metabolic acidosis at the time of discharge.
# EtOH Abuse and r/o Withdrawal: ___ presented to the ED
intoxicated with a serum EtOH of 385. He was placed on a CIWA
scale with diazepam 10mg q4h for CIWA > 10. He never showed
objective evidence of withdrawals during admission. He was also
given a multivitamin, folate and thiamine. Social work was
consulted to counsel about his alcohol abuse and housing options
after discharge from the hospital given that the ___ is
homeless. His serum and urine toxicology screens were negative.
His electrolytes were monitored for refeeding syndrome and
remained within normal limits. The ___ was hemodynamically
stable with an undetectable ethanol level at the time of
discharge. He was ___ for alcohol abstinence.
# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis:
___ presented with an anion gap of 17. Given lack of ketones
in the urine and no serum osmolar gap, lactic acidosis in the
setting of hypovolemia is the most likely etiology. His acidosis
resolved with IVF.
# Mechanical Fall: ___ was found down, and it is unclear how
long he had been down. ___ had a minor headache and forehead
abrasions during his hospitalization but no other evidence of
trauma. CT head and ___ showed no evidence of fracture. CK
was within normal limits ruling out rhabdomyolysis.
# Tobacco Abuse: ___ reported smoking cigarettes although he
did not specify how much. He was treated with a nicotine patch
during this admission and counseled on smoking cessation.
# Type II Diabetes: Chronic, insulin dependent, poorly
controlled, type II, complicated. ___ had elevated finger
sticks in the 200s and was placed on a humalog sliding scale
during his admission. He was found to have an HbA1c of 9.6%. He
was discharged on his home medications, metformin and glipizide.
As an outpatient would advise continuing titration of his
diabetic medications.
#Hypertension: ___ consistently hypertensive while admitted
with systolics in the ___. His home lisinopril was
increased from 20mg to 40mg PO DAILY. In addition, he was
prescribed metoprolol 50mg XL for cardio protection given
history of an MI.
#Schizophrenia: ___ recieves monthly paliperidone
injections. He was continued on home trazodone and hydroxyzine.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=======================
- f/u with his PCP
- ___ counseled on alcohol cessation and smoking cessation
- Continue titration of diabetic medications as outpatient given
elevated ___
- Draft discharge summary faxed to ___ (PCP) on ___ @
___ - fax success
CONTACT INFO FOR HIS PCP: NP ___ - ___, note that
they have a walk in clinic at ___ -
WALK INS for HOMELESS OK 08:30AM - 11:30 AM.
HMED ADD:
On initial admission the ___ was frankly intoxicated with
lab abnormalities which were severe. As a result he was placed
in inpatient status expecting it would take at least 48 hours
(two midnights) to improve labs to baseline, control blood
sugars and monitor for alcohol withdrawal. However once ___
became sober and was able to recount story it was clear he has
never had alcohol withdrawal before, never had DTs or seizures
and so was deemed low risk for developing withdrawal seizures.
Additionally, ___ was not interested in alcohol abstinence
and so was unlikely to remain sober after discharge, limiting
utility of monitoring in house for withdrawal. He never had
evidence of alcohol withdrawal in house. Lastly, patients labs
improved dramatically with IVFs and time returning to normal on
subsequent checks. As a result he did not require an additional
midnight for close monitoring or repeat labs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for surgical 
management of her mitral valve disease. She was taken to the 
operating room where she underwent a  Mitral valve repair with 
resection of the middle scallop posterior leaflet, and a mitral 
valve annuloplasty with  a 28 mm Physio II annuloplasty 
ring/Modified left-sided maze procedure/ Left atrial appendage 
resection with ___ tolerated the procedure well and 
was transferred to the CVICI intubated and sedated. Six
hours status post mitral valve repair and left atrial appendage 
resection and a Maze procedure, was noted to have excessive 
drainage from her chest tube.  She remained
hemodynamically stable.  She was taken back for Mediastinal 
re-exploration/ Evacuation of hematoma/ Repair of left atrial 
appendage bleeder. Please see operative note for details. 
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for 
monitoring.  Over the next several hours she awoke 
neurologically intact and was extubated. All lines and drains 
were discontinued per protocol. POD#1 she was in
atrial fibrillation with fluctuating Blood Pressure. Decision 
made to ___ at 1AM with sinus bradycardia and hypotension 
post-DCCV. She was atrially paced at via external leads with 
stable BP on Nitroglycerine. She was later weaned off NTG and 
did not further require atrial pacing. Pacing wires were removed 
per protocol. Beta blocker was not initiated to allow her 
conduction system recovery, as she remained in a 1st degree AV 
block. She was placed on Amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation, along with anticoagulation with Coumadin. She was 
later transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. 
Mrs. ___ was gently diuresed towards her preoperative 
weight. Ace-Inhibitor was started for blood pressure control. 
The physical therapy service was consulted for evaluation with 
her postoperative strength and mobility. The remainder of her 
postoperative course was essentially uneventful. She continued 
to progress and was cleared for discharge to home on POD# 5 with 
___ services. All follow up appointments were advised.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for surgical
management of her mitral valve disease. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a Mitral valve repair with
resection of the middle scallop posterior leaflet, and a mitral
valve annuloplasty with a 28 mm Physio II annuloplasty
ring/Modified left-sided maze procedure/ Left atrial appendage
resection with ___ tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CVICI intubated and sedated. Six
hours status post mitral valve repair and left atrial appendage
resection and a Maze procedure, was noted to have excessive
drainage from her chest tube. She remained
hemodynamically stable. She was taken back for Mediastinal
re-exploration/ Evacuation of hematoma/ Repair of left atrial
appendage bleeder. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. All lines and drains
were discontinued per protocol. POD#1 she was in
atrial fibrillation with fluctuating Blood Pressure. Decision
made to ___ at 1AM with sinus bradycardia and hypotension
post-DCCV. She was atrially paced at via external leads with
stable BP on Nitroglycerine. She was later weaned off NTG and
did not further require atrial pacing. Pacing wires were removed
per protocol. Beta blocker was not initiated to allow her
conduction system recovery, as she remained in a 1st degree AV
block. She was placed on Amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, along with anticoagulation with Coumadin. She was
later transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
Mrs. ___ was gently diuresed towards her preoperative
weight. Ace-Inhibitor was started for blood pressure control.
The physical therapy service was consulted for evaluation with
her postoperative strength and mobility. The remainder of her
postoperative course was essentially uneventful. She continued
to progress and was cleared for discharge to home on POD# 5 with
___ services. All follow up appointments were advised.

RADIOLOGY:
MRI head ___: Bilateral frontoparietal subdural late 
subacute hematomas resulting in effacement of the sulci in the 
left frontoparietal region. The maximum dimension of the left 
subdural frontoparietal hematoma measures 1.5 cm in diameter and 
in the right side 1.2 cm in diameter.  There is no evidence 
intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. There is 
no evidence of shift of midline structures.  There are no 
enhancing intracranial masses identified. 
.
CT head ___: Bilateral subdural hematomas.  In conjunction 
with the 
information MRI on ___, consistent with late subacute 
hematomas.  However, on the left, there is evidence of acute on 
subacute hemorrhage. The right subdural collection is 
isoattenuating without high attenuating components.  The 
greatest thickness on the left is 10 mm, the greatest thickness 
on the right is 12 mm.  There is no midline shift.  No CT 
evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.  In comparison 
to MRI from yesterday, the size of the collection appears 
stable. 
.
CT head with contrast ___: Unchanged appearance of bilateral 
subdural hematomas, with evidence of re-bleeding on the left, 
unchanged. 
.
MRA head ___: No evidence of dural sinus thrombosis.
.
CT head post op ___: Status post left craniotomy with 
expected postoperative pneumocephalus and fluid filling the left 
subdural space. moderate amount of pneumocephalus as well as a 
mixed collection of fluid and gas now fill the left subdural 
space, measuring approximately 1.4 cm in maximal diameter, with 
unchanged to slightly increased mass effect on the subjacent 
cortex.  The tiny right subdural hematoma is more isodense 
today, measuring 6 mm in greatest diameter.  No significant 
change in mass effect. 2. Unchanged small right subdural 
hematoma, in terms of size, but somewhat more isodense at this 
time. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:

Neurosurgical service was contacted by PCP and pt was instructed 
to report to ED. Upon arrival, CT head showed: Bilateral 
subdural hematomas.  In conjunction with the 
information MRI on ___, consistent with late subacute 
hematomas.  However, on the left, there is evidence of acute on 
subacute hemorrhage. The right subdural collection is 
isoattenuating without high attenuating components.  The 
greatest thickness on the left is 10 mm, the greatest thickness 
on the right is 12 mm.  There is no midline shift.  No CT 
evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.  In comparison 
to MRI from yesterday, the size of the collection appears 
stable.

Given these new findings, the pt was admitted to hospital to 
neurosurgery service.  Follow-up CT on HD#2 was stable.  MRA on 
HD#2 was normal.
.
On HD#3 pt underwent left burrhole minicraniotomy hematoma 
evacution given that abscess could not be ruled out.  The pt 
tolerated the procedure well with no complications (for full 
details of the procedure, please see dictated report). The 
collection appeared to be hematoma grossly, consistent with SDH. 
Intraoperative cultures were sent to check for infectious 
process to be conservative.  Pt's postop CT showed: small amount 
of postoperative pneumocephalus and fluid filling the left 
subdural space. moderate amount of pneumocephalus as well as a 
mixed collection of fluid and gas now fill the left subdural 
space, measuring approximately 1.4 cm in maximal diameter, with 
unchanged to slightly increased mass effect on the subjacent 
cortex.  No significant change in mass effect. For conservative 
measures the patient had supplemental oxygen for 24 hours 
postoperatively given small amount pneumocephalus.  Pt had no 
post-operative neurologic deficits.
.
Neurology and infectious disease services were consulted.

hemorrhoids. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum. 

Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus. Erosion in the 
gastroesophageal junction. Erosions in the antrum and body 
(biopsy). Ulcers in the body (biopsy). Erosions in the duodenal 
bulb. Small hiatal hernia. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of 
the duodenum. 
- Bleeding is likely from NSAID induced ulcer disease.
- Avoid NSAIDs
- 40mg PO omeprazole BID
- We will send her the results of the biopsy and H pylori 
results

MICROBIOLOGY: None 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of 
diverticulosis s/p several GI bleeds, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p stent, occipital neuralgia, and 
intractable migraine headaches who presented to ___ as a 
transfer from ___ for BRBPR and concern for GI 
bleed.

# GI bleed/BRBPR: Patient had a large bloody bowel movement on 
___ and is s/p 2U PRBC's at ___. This has happened numerous 
times in the past and Most likely lower GI bleed but brisk upper 
source cannot be ruled out. Ddx includes diverticular bleed, 
angiodysplasia, or hemorrhoids/fissue, although the significant 
nature of the bleed makes this last option less likely. Also 
less likely is PUD as patient is not having pain (although she 
has significant NSAID use), and varices also unlikely as no hx 
liver dx. Upon exam, patient guaiac +. Per ___ records, 
seen by Dr. ___ had EGD although low concern for upper 
bleed. Colonoscopy showed diverticula and internal hemorrhoids. 
GI bleeding scan with tagged red blood cells showed no bleeding 
source. CTA also showed no source of bleed. She received a total 
of 3U PRBC's between ___ and the ___ ED during this admission. 
She was placed in IV bid ppi and given clears. Her Hct remained 
stable overnight and she did not require additional products. 
She was prepped for an ___, which showed NSAID-induced 
ulcers in the stomach and duodenum as well as diverticulosis; 
ulcers likely responsible for bleeding. She was started on po 
pantoprazole 40 mg q12 hrs to be continued at discharge for 8 
weeks.

# Chronic headaches: The patient and her daughter reported a 
history of chronic severe migraines and have seen many 
specialists. The patient's neurologist Dr. ___ was contacted 
and indicated that numerous therapies have failed for the 
patient. She has had specially protocoled MRI's, injections, and 
numerous trials of medication (gabapentin, propranolol, 
verapamil) without much effect. She is still taking propranolol 
but not gabapentin or verapamil. The most likely diagnosis at 
this point is hemicrania continua, although intractable 
migraines/occipital neuralgia are on her diagnosis list. Per Dr. 
___ to give occasional tylenol. Unclear what the role of 
steroids will be in the future, as unclear what we are treating, 
but plan was for it to be an outpatient issue after discharge. 
Per the patient's last note at ___ on ___, the plan had been 
for her to start another prednisone taper. Given her risk of 
bleeding, however, this will be deferred to the outpatient 
setting. It was explained to the patient that she wil need to 
f/u at ___ and that she absolutely must not take NSAID 
medications. Her lisinopril and propranolol were restarted at 
discharge.

# Hypertension: Held lisinopril and propranolol in house, 
restarted at discharge
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin.
# CAD: Continued simvastatin, no NSAIDs, held lisinopril in 
house.

Transitional issues:
- Patient will need f/u with her Neurologist regarding 
headaches. PCP followup appointment arranged.
- She should have her CBCs checked as outpatient. She may 
benefit from iron supplementation in the future.
- GI will contact her regarding biopsy results. She does not 
need GI followup at ___, but referral may be considered as 
outpatient. If patient will require NSAIDs in the future, she 
should remain on daily PPI. However, if patient is able to avoid 
further use of NSAIDs, typical taper prescribed by ___ GI team 
is:
"" You may experience increased acid reflux after you stop taking 
your PPI medication (omeprazole, pantoprazole, Nexium, Prilosec, 
etc). In order to decrease the chance of this occurring, we 
recommend that you taper the medication in the following 
fashion.
1. If you are taking the medication twice a day, start by only 
taking it once a day for at least 2 weeks.
2. If you are on 40mg of the medication, decrease this dose by 
50% for at least 2 weeks.
3. Once you are on the lowest dose, you can take the medication 
every other day for 2 weeks. If you experience heartburn during 
this time, you can take 150mg Zantac (Ranitidine) to help 
control the symptoms.
4. If you do not have heartburn at this juncture, you can stop 
the medication.
5. If your heartburn returns, you can take Zantac or your PPI as 
needed.""

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___ 12:00 AM)
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly. Diffusely increased interstitial 
markings, likely represent CHF in this setting.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___ 1:26 ___
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, there is little 
overall change. Low lung volumes may contribute to the 
prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Diffuse 
prominence of pulmonary markings bilaterally may be slightly 
improved, relating to the diuresis. Although this may represent 
elevated pulmonary venous pressure, the possibility of severe 
underlying chronic pulmonary disease must be considered. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with h/o CHF (EF ___ in ___, CAD s/p MI, 
DM, hypothyroidism, and dementia transferred from ___ 
with acute shortness of breath consistent with acute CHF 
exacerbation, in house found to be profoundly hypothyroid.

# CHF Exacerbation: Admitted with hypoxemia, requiring 
non-rebreather and CXR suggestive of florid pulmonary edema. 
Known EF ___ and LV thrombus on echo in ___. Unclear reason 
for decompensation - medication non-compliance vs. ischemia vs. 
dietary non-compliance. TSH 58 and hypothyroidism (FT4 0.4) can 
lead to worsened diastolic dysfunction so this could be 
contributing. Was actively diuresed at first successfully, over 
past 24h reacted less to lasix and developed othro-hypo, 
Diuresis held ___ with even goal, ___ +300cc for 24h, lungs 
sound more congested this morning but clinically stable and not 
hypoxic. Her metoprolol 12.5mg bid was continued. As her blood 
pressures and creatinine were stable, home lisinopril 5mg was 
started ___. She was also put on a cardiac healthy, low Na diet 
and her I/Os were targeted to be even. She was gradually weaned 
down from 2L delivered via nasal cannulae to O2 sats of the 
low-90s on room air. Patient remained euvolemic with no need for 
diuresis in house on days preceding discharge. Decision made to 
hold diuresis at time of discharge.
.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
- Continue metoprolol XL
- Consider performing echocardiography to reassess functional 
status and ejection fraction
- Follow-up with new cardiologist at ___ (Dr. ___ has 
retired) regarding LV thrombus and ?anticoagulation. If goal of 
care is comfort, would only schedule follow-up with primary care 
(done)
- Reassess need for PO diuretic as outpatient
.
# Cough- Persistent, non-productive. Has a history of 
bronchitis. Initially attributed to fluid overload. The concern 
was for pulmonary edema vs aspiration pneumonia vs bronchitis. 
She was afebrile, w/o leukocytosis and w/o infiltrates on repeat 
CXR. Impression was residual bronchitis in the setting of 
resolving pulmonary edema, with no pneumonic process. She was 
assessed by Rehab and placed on aspiration precautions with soft 
solids and thin liquids (Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) 
rating of 7 out of 7). Nebulisers were ordered PRN. Stable and 
largely resolved prior to discharge
.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
- Follow-up speech and swallow recommendations
- Follow-up with primary care physician for bronchitis
- Start Albuterol inhaler as needed at home
- Aspiration precautions at home
.
# CAD: Known CAD s/p MI; No stress tests or cath reports 
available in our system. Here with troponin leak, but no 
complaints of chest pain and EKG at baseline with pre-cordial 
anteroseptal ST elevations c/w known LV aneurysm. Enzyme leak 
most likely demand related in setting of CHF exacerbation. 
Troponins peaked at 0.25, MB: 21, and CK rose to 2396 thus far.  
Elevated CK likely secondary to immobilization. Heparin gtt 
d/c-ed on ___. No active issues related to CAD during 
hospitalization.
.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
- Continue home ASA
- Continue metoprolol XL
- Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg if BPs remain stable
- Continue simvastatin
.
# RHYTHM: No known history of arrhythmias, been consistently in 
normal sinus rhythm since admission.
.
# Agitation/Dementia: Patient with significant agitation 
(including removing IVs, biting EMS) with some improvement with 
haldol and later zyprexa. Baseline is unknown. Hypothyroidism 
may be contributing given elevated TSH. Per caretakers at 
baseline alert and oriented x3 although dementia is listed in 
her PMH. Mental status possibly improved with 50mg qd then 100mg 
qd levothyroxine replacement. UA was negative, decreasing the 
possiblity of a UTI. She was not hyponatremic. The nurses 
actively engaged her with cards, games and crossword puzzles as 
per ___ protocol. Tether use was minimized as far as possible. 

.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
- Consider, if necessary, neurology evaluation for dementia and 
management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia 
(if present)
- Caregiver should continue keeping her engaged in 
mentally-stimulating activities to prevent deterioration of 
cognitive function
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage III per ___ 
discharge summary, with creatinine of 1.4 in ___ (unclear if 
this is baseline). Creatinine stably elevated at 1.6 with 
trending. Nephrotoxins and renally dose medications were 
avoided. Diuresis with lisinopril was done to improve forward 
flow. At time of discharge creatinine stable at 1.1.
.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
- Continue to trend renal function as outpatient
.
# Hypothyroidism- Pt w/ high TSH of 58. Total T4: 3.2 Per 
discharge summary from ___ was supposed to be taking 
levothyroxine 200 mg PO daily, but per hand written medlist from 
___, does not appear to be taking at home. Per PCP coverage, 
as of ___ (at which time TSH was suppressed) dosing was 
175mcg MWF, 200mcg TThSaSu Restarted levothyroxine initially at 
50mg to prevent excessive myocardial oxygen demand. The free T4 
level was low at 0.4 on ___, and her dosing was increased to 
100mg.
.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
- Follow-up for hypothyroidism as this may complicate her 
cognitive function
- Will need repeat TFTs as outpatient
.
# DM-No active issues during CCU stay. She was continued on home 
lantus and put on a novolog sliding scale.
.
# Restless leg syndrome-No active issues during CCU stay. She 
was continued on home mirapex.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent Aortic valve replacement with 19mm Magna 
Ease tissue valve.  The Cardiopulmonary ByPass time was 128 
minutes with a Cross-clamp time of 114 minutes.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
On POD 1 she was extubated and breathing comfortably.  She was 
neurologically intact, alert, oriented and hemodynamically 
stable. She weaned from vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was 
initiated and titrated as tolerated.  She had a brief episode of 
atrial fibrillation and was started on  PO Amiodarone. Patient 
remained in SR and therefore anticoagulation was not required.  
She was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. 
Transferred to the floor on POD1. Her acute blood loss anemia 
remained stable with a hematocrit of 24. She had mild 
hypotention while recovering on the floor and Lasix was held and 
required fluid bolus. Since then her BP has improved, and low 
dose Lasix was resumed.   Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by 
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was 
ambulating with the assistance of a rolling walker. She has a 
prevena sternal dressing that is CDI. Her pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in 
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

INTERPRETATION: This ___ yo man with h/o HTN, HLD, IDDM, and 
smoking
was referred to the lab from the inpatient floor following 
negative
serial cardiac enzymes for evaluation of chest discomfort. The 
patient
exercised for 12.5 minutes of a Modified ___ protocol and was 
stopped
for fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 10.6, which 
represents
an average exercise tolerance for his age. There were no reports 
of
chest, back, neck, or arm discomforts during the study. There 
were no
significant ST changes noted during exercise or recovery. Rhythm 
was
sinus with no ectopy. There was a blunted heart rate response to
exercise in the presence of beta blockade. There was an 
appropriate
blood pressure response during exercise and recovery.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. 
Average
functional capacity. Nuclear report sent separately.

PERFUSION
FINDINGS:
 
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue 
attenuation.  
 
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.  
 
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the
left ventricular myocardium.
 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 54% with an 
EDV of 95 ml.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Normal myocardial perfusion at the level of exercise 
achieved.
 
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.  
 
In the setting of diabetes, normal myocardial perfusion does not 
necessarily
imply a low risk of adverse cardiac events.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
====================
___ is a ___ current every day smoker, with IDDM 
(A1c 11.5) p/w 3 days of chest pain that radiates to his back, 
shoulders, and head. CTA performed in the ED ruled out aortic 
dissection, trops negative x3, due to symptoms concerning for 
unstable angina he underwent exercise nuclear stress test which 
did not identify any reversible perfusion defects. Due to 
suboptimal study (approx. 12 minutes on modified ___ protocol) 
he was discharged home with instructions to follow up as 
outpatient for stress echo and in cardiology clinic.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Stress echo scheduled for ___ at 8 am

[] Cardiology follow up scheduled with Dr. ___.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#Chest pain
Patient stated that he has had this pain in the past. About ___ 
years ago, he was admitted to ___ with similar symptoms but had 
a negative cardiac workup including negative echo stress test. 
The symptoms ultimately resolved but had similar symptoms 3 days 
ago and have been progressively getting worse. The pain started 
while he was shampooing his carpet two days prior to admission. 
The symptoms again worsened when he was walking outside to the 
bus stop to get to work in the AM, an approximate distance of 50 
meters. These episodes of pain are associated with 
lightheadedness, pleuritic chest pain, nausea and dizziness 
which are worse with exertion and resolved with rest. He denies 
fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Denies cough, hemoptysis, 
recent long travel, unilateral ___ edema or tenderness. Troponins 
were <0.01 x3. CXR in the ED did not demonstrate any acute 
intrathoracic process. subsequent CTA showed no acute 
intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pathology. There was mild 
emphysematous changes and moderate atherosclerotic disease. He 
underwent a modified ___ protocol, whereby he was on the 
treadmill for 12.5 minute and achieved a 56% target heart rate. 
Nuclear imaging showed no diffusion defects and no ECG changes 
were observed. Due to suboptimal study conditions (patient had 
taken beta blocker that morning) he was discharged home with 
plan to follow up as outpatient for repeat stress echo.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were admitted to the hospital because you had episodes of 
chest pain, lightheadedness and difficulty breathing.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- In the hospital, we performed some imaging of your chest and 
heart, which were reassuring. Given that these episodes have 
happened before, we also performed a stress test to see if there 
were any changes in the electrical rhythm of your heart during 
exercise or decreased flow of blood through your arteries. Both 
of these studies did not show any abnormalities.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
- Please take all of your medications exactly as prescribed and 
attend all of your follow-up appointments listed below.

- You will have a stress test as an outpatient next week.

We wish you the best!

Echo: Suboptimal image quality. Critical aortic valve stenosis. 
Severe pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation. Symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and low normal 
global biventricular systolic function.

Brain MRI:
No acute infarction. 
2.  Moderate-to-significant chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease.

CTA head and neck: Mild focal narrowing at the inferior branch 
of M2 of the right MCA, without distal occlusion.  Otherwise, 
essentially normal CTA, without flow-limiting stenosis, aneurysm 
greater than 3 mm or vascular malformation. Mild carotid 
bifurcation calcification, without flow-limiting stenosis. Major 
cervical vessels patent. 
  
EEG: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG telemetry due to 
slow 
posterior dominant rhythm, intermittent focal slowing and 
frequent 
epileptiform sharp waves over left temporo-parietal regions. 
There are no 
pushbutton activations. Automated and routine sampling 
demonstrate frequent sharp discharges over the left 
temporo-parietal regions. No electrographic seizures are seen. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
  ___  ___ is a ___ yo woman with history of HTN, CHF, 
aortic stenosis, osteoarthritis, impaired hearing and dementia 
who presented after an episode of sudden onset confusional state 
and loss of balance while walking toward music class with her 
aide. Upon her arrival, a CODE STROKE was called. CT imaging in 
the ED, including CT perfusion did not show any acute stroke or 
perfusion deificts. An MRI was performed, which did not show any 
acute infarcts. She had an EEG to evaluate for seizure as 
possible cause of her presentation; the EEG showed no 
electrographic 
seizures, though she did have frequent epileptogenic discharges 
over left temporo-parietal regions. As no seizures were seen, it 
was decided that the risk of starting an antiepileptic 
medication outweighed the benefits. She had a TTE, which showed 
critical aortic valve stenosis and severe pulmonary 
hypertension. Her critical AS was previously known to family and 
she has an outpatient cardiologist who follows her for this; it 
was decided as an outpatient to not pursue surgical 
intervention. Her episode of confusional state and loss of 
balance was most likely due to a presyncopal episode of cardiac 
etiology. While being monitored on telemetry, she was noted to 
have long pauses. She also developed an episode of fluid 
responsive hypotension. A Cardiology Consult was placed; they 
recommended that due to the pauses on telemetry, Digoxin and 
Metoprolol should be d/c. Initially, they recommended continuing 
Lasix 40 mg qAM and subsequently to add a 20 mg dose of Lasix in 
the afternoon. After the Metoprolol and Digoxin were held, she 
was no longer having long pauses on tele and her blood pressure 
remained stable. 
  Due to her critical AS, after discussion with family, Code 
Status was changed to DNR/DNI. Her family believed that she 
would be happiest if she would be able to return to her assisted 
living facility. A palliative care consult was placed; who 
recommended that ___ evaluate her and see if she will be able to 
ambulate and thus return to her assisted living facility. Her 
assisted care facility representative came to assess her and 
determined that she would be able to return if a home health 
aide was obtained to be with her overnight; this was obtained 
and she is being discharged to her assisted living facility.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___ ,
It was our pleasure to take care of you during your stay in 
stroke service, you were admitted here as you developed acute 
change in your mental status and became confused while you were 
in your assisted living. During your hospitalization, we 
evaluated you for both stroke and seizure as possible causes of 
your confusion. There was no evidence of stroke on MRI. On the 
EEG, there was no seizures (there were some discharges that 
could indicate possible seizure tendency, but no seizures and it 
was determined adding another medication at this time without 
evidence of clear seizure activity has more risks than 
benefits). On the echocardiogram, one of your heart values is 
very narrow and it is believed this resulted in your symptoms. 
You were having cardiac pauses on tele. Cardiology saw you and 
recommended stopping some of your cardiac medications, including 
Metoprolol and Digoxin, and increasing your Lasix. You should 
follow-up with your outpatient cardiologist regarding this. 
.
We made the following changes to your medications: 
1. STOPPED metoprolol
2. STOPPED digoxin
3. INCREASED lasix to 40mg by mouth in the morning and 20mg by 
mouth before bedtime

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___ ,
It was our pleasure to take care of you during your stay in
stroke service, you were admitted here as you developed acute
change in your mental status and became confused while you were
in your assisted living. During your hospitalization, we
evaluated you for both stroke and seizure as possible causes of
your confusion. There was no evidence of stroke on MRI. On the
EEG, there was no seizures (there were some discharges that
could indicate possible seizure tendency, but no seizures and it
was determined adding another medication at this time without
evidence of clear seizure activity has more risks than
benefits). On the echocardiogram, one of your heart values is
very narrow and it is believed this resulted in your symptoms.
You were having cardiac pauses on tele. Cardiology saw you and
recommended stopping some of your cardiac medications, including
Metoprolol and Digoxin, and increasing your Lasix. You should
follow-up with your outpatient cardiologist regarding this.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STOPPED metoprolol
2. STOPPED digoxin
3. INCREASED lasix to 40mg by mouth in the morning and 20mg by
mouth before bedtime

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress:  Treated for Healthcare associated 
pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. He was oxygenating adequately 
on ___ mask and ventilating adequately with pCO2 39 on VBG 
upon arrival to the ICU, though he was at risk for tiring out if 
tachypnea persisted.  He was empirically started on HCAP 
coverage with vanc and cefepime, and azithromycin was added.  
The initial chest x-ray did not show a definitive pneumonia, but 
a repeat chest x-ray did suggest pneumonia.  Legionella urinary 
antigen was negative.  He was continued on ___ mask and 
transitioned to NC O2.

Upon discharge he was breathing comfortably on 2L NC.

# Sepsis:  Pt met SIRS criteria with fever, leukocytosis and 
tachycardia, likely due to PNA as above.  Doubted UTI given 
bland UA.  He had a pressure sore on his left hip which was well 
appearing.  C. difficile colitis was on the differential since 
pt was recently treated with levofloxacin, but he did not have 
diarrhea and his abdominal exam was benign.  Blood cultures were 
drawn and pt was treated with vanc/cefepime/azithro as above.  
He was continued on broad-spectrum IV antibx until discharge.

# Renal insufficiency:  Cr is 1.6, increased from 1.2 in ___. 
 Ddx included prerenal azotemia which was most likely in setting 
of hypernatremia.  Intrinsic renal disease, possibly due to 
prolonged prerenal state, was also a consideration.  Post-renal 
obstruction was possible and would most likely be relieved by 
placement of foley in ED.  He was rehydrated with IVF and Cr 
improved to 1.0.

# Hypernatremia: Ongoing problem at nursing facility.  Most 
likely due to poor PO intake and limited access to free water 
given immobility.  ___ also be exacerbated by insensible water 
losses in the setting of infection.  He was initially given 
isotonic fluid boluses for now, and after volume resuscitation 
was given D5W to replete free water deficit.

# Anemia:  Macrocytic anemia with MCV 104.  Chart history lists 
anemia though does not characterize which type.  Differential 
diagnosis includes B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, liver 
disease, reticulocytosis, hypothyroidism, MDS.  B12 level was 
greater than normal and TSH was WNL.  H/H on admission was 
9.4/32.2 and decreased to 6.___.0 on the second hospital day. 
Improved and stable in the mid ___ without transfusion.

# Coagulopathy: Elevated ___ and INR but normal PTT.  Suspected 
dietary vitamin K defiency; differential also included liver 
disease, factor inhibitor.  No procedures were planned and there 
was no need for reversing with vitamin K.

# Code status/goals of care

His family was contacted about code status and goals of care, 
and he was made DNR/DNI.  He was continued on albuterol and 
ipratropium nebs PRN. He was weaned off of ___ mask to nasal 
cannula. 

Spoke with son ___ and his wife ___ (a nurse). We 
discussed his poor prognosis in general and likelihood that he 
will have another apsiration event very soon. For quality of 
life issues we will continue to feed him. They still do want 
antibiotics and some therapy, but they do not want aggressive 
treatment such as intubation or operations. we left messages for 
___ the other son. His daughter was not reachable as she is a 
nursing home herself.

I spoke with ___, the nurse practitioner at the ___ and 
updated her on course of care during hospital.

out MI because of positive stress test.  She had a perfusion 
stress test that was negative, and was transferred to the 
neurology service for further evaluation of her arm symptoms.
.
# CARDS:  She was initially put on a 325mg ASA, but was then 
switched to 81mg ASA when her cardiac enzymes and her perfusion 
stress test returned negative.  We decided to restart her on 
lipitor at dispo.  Per cardiology recs she was also started on 
lisinopril 5mg QD to better control her BP and for her strong 
FHx of heart disease.  

# NEURO: Her MRI/MRA showed no acute issue.  Her EEG showed no 
seizure activity.  We continued her on her home gabapentin, 
metaxalone and amytriptyline.  We felt that her sx were likely 
related to her known cervical spine degeneration, however if her 
sx do not improve with a soft cervical collar and rest she will 
have a more extensive workup as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was our pleasure taking care of you at ___.  

You were admitted from the emergency room for heaviness in your 
left arm and a positive exercise stress test.  

We repeated a stress test with nuclear imaging which showed the 
same changes on your EKG as the previous test, but no concerning 
changes in the perfusion/ blood flow to your heart muscle, which 
is reassuring.  We also did an electroencephalogram, measuring 
the electrical activity in your brain, which did not show any 
seizure activity and an MRI of your head to look at the brain 
and vasculature in your brain that did not show any abnormality. 
 Therefore, we sent you home with a soft cervical collar and 
plan to see if you improve in clinic.

We made the following changes to your medications.
Please START Lisinopril 5mg daily
Please START Lipitor 20mg daily.

Dear Ms ___,
It was our pleasure taking care of you at ___.
You were admitted from the emergency room for heaviness in your
left arm and a positive exercise stress test.
We repeated a stress test with nuclear imaging which showed the
same changes on your EKG as the previous test, but no concerning
changes in the perfusion/ blood flow to your heart muscle, which
is reassuring. We also did an electroencephalogram, measuring
the electrical activity in your brain, which did not show any
seizure activity and an MRI of your head to look at the brain
and vasculature in your brain that did not show any abnormality. Therefore, we sent you home with a soft cervical collar and
plan to see if you improve in clinic.
We made the following changes to your medications.
Please START Lisinopril 5mg daily
Please START Lipitor 20mg daily.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo female with PMHx Afib on apixaban, 
C.diff on flagyl, and hypothyroidism who presented after an 
unwitnessed fall.

The patient was hospitalized 4 weeks ago at ___ for 
PNA and had a R thoracentesis for 1L while there. She was 
discharged to rehab and has been ___ for one week. She 
completed her antibiotic course for PNA per her daughter, but 
was unsure of the  exact regimen. In the past week, the patient 
was seen by her PCP for complaints of weakness and diarrhea and 
was diagnosed with C.diff and started on flagyl. 

The patient is demented and thinks she is in ___, limiting 
the interview. She denies any loss of consciousness and is 
unsure what caused the fall. She reports feeling very week over 
the past week due to her diarrhea from C. diff.

In ED initial VS:  T 97.4, HR 120, BP 97/48, RR 20, O2 98% on RA

The patient was weak appearing, but NAD. She was noted to have a 
large left ___ hematoma but otherwise her CT and trauma 
eval were non-focal. Abdomen was soft, non-tender, 
non-distended.

hemorrhage or mass effect.
- C-spine w/o con: No acute fracture or malalignment.  Mild 
degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
- CXR: No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Minimal right 
costophrenic angle blunting could suggest a trace pleural 
effusion.

Patient was  given 4L NS in the ED.  She was continued on PO 
flagyl and then switched to PO Vancomycin and given her ___ 
dose metoprolol tartrate 100 mg. ACS was consulted and 
recommended medical management of C.diff. No other injuries 
identified on tertiary exam.

Patient initially had HRs in 100s-120s with BPs in 
___. Then the patient's MAPs dropped into the ___ 
with worsening AMS, despite IVF. Her HRs were in 110s-120s on 
___ metoprolol. She was switched to PO vanc for her C.diff and 
broadened to IV Vanc/Zosyn for possible sepsis of ?GI origin. 
She was started on levophed and given an additional 2L NS fluid

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo female with PMHx Afib on apixaban, 
C.diff on flagyl, HTN, and hypothyroidism who presented after an 
unwitnessed fall found to be in Afib with RVR and develop 
hypotension now requiring 1 pressor. Course has been complicated 
by acute delirium. 

#Goals of care:
Initially full code.  Due to Pt's clinical deterioration, as 
well as her lack of improvement despite pressor initiation and 
frequent fluid resuscitation, a goals of care meeting was had 
with the family on ___.  She was transitioned to comfort 
measures only at that time.  Medications not contributing to the 
patient's comfort were stopped after this meeting. She died 
shortly after being called out from the ICU.

# Shock
# Hypotension
Likely due to sepsis from C. diff vs unknown source, compounded 
by hypovolemia due to poor PO intake and diarrhea. Cardiac 
etiology possible, given afib with RVR and extravascular 
overload, though this seemed less likely. Given significant 
fluid repletion during her hospital course (over 18L positive as 
of ICU discharge), given IVC collapsibility and frequent fluid 
responsiveness.  Over the course of her hospital course, she 
required central access for pressor support.  C. diff was 
positive, so PO vancomycin and IV metronidazole were initiated 
in addition to empiric vanc/cefepime for sepsis of other unclear 
source.  AM cortisol negative for adrenal insufficiency.  After 
goals of care meeting as above, antibiotics and other 
medications not focused on comfort were discontinued.

#AFib with RVR: 
Initially requiring amiodarone bolus -> gtt, then PO with 
Dobhoff.  Precedex also initiated to help with agitation and 
provide some rate control given side effect of bradycardia.  She 
was on heparin gtt for anticoagulation given several procedures 
during her hospital course. 
 
#C. Diff: 
Treated with PO vancomycin and IV metronidazole as above.

# Delirium
___ ICU, illness, hypotension. Per discussion with the family, 
has had some element of progressive decline since new diagnosis 
of Afib in ___.  Precedex initially required for 
agitation, but this was discontinued as Pt's mental status 
declined. 

#Acute on chronic kidney injury with
#Volume overload
___ initially improved with fluids, then began to worsen as Pt 
became progressively fluid overloaded.  Unable to improve volume 
overload with diuresis.  After goals of care meeting, further 
fluid and diuretic administration was stopped.

# Unwitnessed Fall
CT head and C-spine without pathology.  Echocardiogram ___ with 
preserved biventricular systolic function, moderate MR and mild 
PA systolic hypertension.  

#Hypothyroidism
Continued ___ levothyroxine 50 mcg

MICROBIOLOGY

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with h/o HTN, COPD, ?neuromuscular disorder who was 
admitted after cardiac arrest with CHB. She developed hypoxemic 
respiratory failure and failed an extubation trial. She went 
into complete heart block, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and 
atrial flutter intermittently, and was put on heparin due to her 
high risk of thromboembolism. She suffered PEA arrest x2 
secondary to retroperitoneal bleed. She went into mixed 
septic/hypovolemic shock requiring multiple pressors. She 
developed acute renal failure requiring CRRT. During this time, 
she remained on ventilator support. On ___, a family 
meeting was held to discuss overall prognosis and further goals 
of care. In accordance with the patient's previously described 
preferences, the decision was made by the family to transition 
the patient to comfort-focused care. The patient died peacefully 
on ___ at 1540.
 
# Cardiac arrest prior to admission: 
Initial arrest occurred due to complete heart block. Admission 
electrolytes were normal and tox screen was negative. She was 
initially treated with heparin gtt x48 hours, asa, atorvastatin 
80, metoprolol, and ACEi as blood pressures tolerated. She 
underwent post-arrest cooling protocol and her sedation was 
weaned on ___. Her mental status improved initially, however, 
she declined after she developed a retroperitoneal bleed and PEA 
arrested on ___. Despite aggressive interventions including 
maximizing her pressor support, she never recovered from this 
event.

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated in 
setting of her initial cardiac arrest. Chest XR showed pulmonary 
edema, so patient was started on diuresis with Lasix 40mg IV 
boluses PRN.  She was also treated for healthcare associated 
pneumonia. She was extubated on ___, as her mental status had 
improved and she had passed RSBI, but was noted to have 
persistently low O2 sats and abundant secretions. She was 
re-intubated on ___ and continued to require ventilator 
support. She was unable to protect her airway without the 
ventilator. She was made comfort measures only on ___ and she 
was terminally extubated.

# Cardiac conduction disease
The patient developed complete heart block, atrial fibrillation 
with RVR, and atrial flutter at various points her admission. 
These were all felt to have occurred secondary to defective AV 
conduction and ventricular dyssynchrony. She was initially put 
on heparin because of her high CHA2DS2-VASc score (3), but this 
was discontinued when she develop a retroperitoneal bleed. She 
was started on amiodarone on ___ for refractory atrial 
fibrillation with RVR and chemically converted shortly 
thereafter.

# PEA arrest x2 during hospitalization, secondary to
# Retroperitoneal hemorrhage/acute blood loss anemia
The patient suffered PEA arrest x2 on ___ due to acute 
hemorrhagic shock in the setting of retroperitoneal bleed. She 
was resuscitated, heparin was stopped, and received multiple 
transfusions for her hypovolemic/hemorrhagic shock.

# Mixed hypovolemic/septic/cardiogenic shock
The patient developed shock requiring multiple pressors. 
Initially, her shock was thought to be more cardiogenic in 
nature, due to poor cardiac output in the setting of her 
arrhythmias. Later, there was more concern for hypovolemic vs. 
septic shock. Multiple blood, sputum, and urine cultures were 
obtained due to the patient's fever and leukocytosis, but a 
causative organism was never found. Hypovolemic shock secondary 
to retroperitoneal bleed was managed with fluid repletion, blood 
transfusions, and multiple pressors, as above. A decision was 
made not to pursue diagnostic CT scan to find a possible source 
of her elevated white count and concern for sepsis given her 
grim prognosis and that additional interventions would not help 
prolong her life. She was continued on antibiotics for empiric 
coverage.

#R Pneumothorax: 
The patient developed a right pneumothorax after her PEA arrests 
on ___,
thought to be due to chest compressions during the 
resuscitation. Thoracic surgery placed a pigtail. Her 
pneumothorax remained stable based on daily chest xrays and did 
not demonstrated any signs of being a tension pneumothorax. 
After consulting with thoracic surgery, it was determined that 
she did not need a chest tube.

#Renal Failure: 
The patient developed acute renal failure after her PEA arrests 
on ___. She had negligible urine output and was put on CRRT. She 
was diagnosed with ATN as her urine output did not recover.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Neuromuscular disorder: per report from family. Patient had 
long-standing ___ weakness which was attributed in some 
documentation to CVA. However, family stated that she had no 
history of stroke, and had been diagnosed with a ""muscle 
breakdown disorder"", was reportedly seen by neurologist and was 
lost to follow up. However, no outside neurologist could be 
located, despite multiple attempts.

#Hypertension: Home antihypertensives were held in the setting 
of shock requiring multiple pressors.

#COPD: The patient received albuterol and ipratroprium MDIs 
while intubated.

#GERD: The patient was placed on IV PPI for ppx while intubated. 
Her home famotidine was held during this time.

IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Fluid and air tracking along the fascia planes within left 
forearm flexor compartment, particularly along the proximal to 
mid aspect of the radial artery, which is attenuated but patent. 
Findings are highly concerning for an infectious process. Given 
the presence of air tracking along the fascial planes, 
necrotizing fasciitis cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation 
is recommended.
2. Multifocal skin defects along the dorsal aspects of both 
hands, with
underlying abscess/phlegmon formation. Fluid tracking throughout 
the deeper soft tissues along the dorsal aspect of the left 
hand, particularly over the third and fourth metacarpals, 
concerning for early abscess formation.
3. No CT evidence of osteomyelitis. Of note, MRI is more 
sensitive for
detection of early changes of osteomyelitis.

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe 
tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial 
pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with 
normal valve morphology. Right ventricular cavity dilation with 
preserved free wall motion. Mild mitral regurgitation with 
normal valve morphology. No aortic valve pathology or pathologic 
flow. Normal left ventricular cavity size with preserved 
regional and global systolic function. Pulmonary artery 
hypertension. 

If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to assess 
the tricuspid valve for possible vegetations/pathology.

fever and bilateral hand cellulitis and abscess of left forearm.

# Bilateral Hand cellulitis- The patient developed bilateral 
hand cellulitis with overlying ulceration and eschar in the 
setting of active IVDU and skin popping . She was started on IV 
Vancomycin and Unasyn. A plain film of the hand showed no 
evidence of osteomyelitis. CT scan of bilateral upper 
exteremities was concerning for deep space infection of the left 
forearm and multifocal skin defects along the dorsal aspects of 
both hands. CT also demonstrated underlying abscess/phlegmon 
formation as well as fluid tracking throughout the deeper soft 
tissues along the dorsal aspect of the left hand, particularly 
over the third and fourth metacarpals, concerning for early 
abscess formation. She was taken to the OR by hand surgery ( see 
below). In the OR hand surgery inspected the eschars on the 
dorsum of the hands.  These were curetted down to subcutaneous 
tissue without evidence of deeper purulence or air tracking. She 
was continued on IV Vanc/Unasyn for ongoing treatment of the 
cellulitis, with improvement in her wound and eschar. Blood 
cultures from admission were negative. Tissues culture grew 
MSSA. She was transitioned to IV naficillin 2gm IV q4H. The 
patient was not able to be sent to a rehab to complete 
antibiotics ___ insurance issues and ultimately decided to leave 
against medical advice. She was sent home with a script for 
Augmentin 875 mg BID to end on ___, as well as lyrica for 
pain control. She was not sent home with a script for narcotics 
given AMA discharge. She will require follow up in the hand 
clinic every ___ until her wounds heal. She was provided 
with the number to the ___ clinic to schedule a follow up 
appointment since one could not be made before she left AMA. Of 
note, a multidisciplinary meeting was held prior to her 
discharge with social work, case management, and medical team. 
Given limited discharge options, best available plan was 
transition to PO antibiotics, with antibiotic choice reviewed 
with ID consultants. Given patient's desire to leave the 
hospital, unable to monitor clinical response to transition to 
Augmentin.

 # MSSA left forearm  deep space infection- The patient noted to 
have a large area of induration and warmth on the medial aspect 
of her left forearm. CT of bilateral upper extremity showed 
fluid and air tracking along the fascia planes within left 
forearm flexor compartment, particularly along the proximal to 
mid aspect of the radial artery, which is attenuated but patent 
concerning for necrotizing fascitis. She was urgently taken to 
the OR by hand surgery and I and D of the left forearm. She was 
found to have  purulent material in the subcutaenous tissue and 
fascia, but were viable without evidence of nectrotizing 
fascitis. She was also found to have granulation tissue and 
encasement of the radial artery and specimen was sent for 
culture.  A wound vac and she went back to the OR on ___ for 
closeur and removal of the wound vac.  Cultures grew MSSA and 
she was transitioned to Nafcillin 2gm IV q4 and then Augmentin ( 
see above)

# Intravenous drug user- The patient is an active drug user. Was 
recently enrolled in a ___ clinic 2 weeks prior to 
admission. Per her ___ clinic ___ Op Co ( ___, 
she was last dosed on ___. The patient admits to missing clinic 
2 days prior to admission to use heroin and cocaine. She left AM 
and was told to follow up with her ___ clinic.  Hep B, Hep 
C, and HIV were checked and were negative. To manage her 
withdrawal she was maintained on methadone 30 mg daily, and 
received PO clonidine 0.1 mg BID x 2 dose and then a clonidine 
patch that was discontinued after 5 days.

# Iron defeciency anemia/Anemia of chronic inflammation-  The 
patient Hgb naidered at 6.2. Her anemia was likely a combination 
of ACD and Fe def anemia.  ACD suggested by low TIBC and 
transferrin. Fe def anemia suggested by low ferritin, 
microcytosis, and low serum Ferritin however  would expect TIBC 
and transferrin to be elevated. Stool guiac neg x 1. She was 
transfused a total of 2 units PRBCs for Hb<7.

# Murmur- The patient had a murmur on exam; likely from her 
previous episode of tricuspid endocarditis. Repeat echo here 
confirmed moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation without 
evidence of vegetation. Blood cultures were negative.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 9:16 AM 

Final Report 
INDICATION: ___ male patient status post bypass surgery. 
Evaluate 
for effusion.   
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient 
in upright 
position. Comparison is made with the preceding preoperative 
chest 
examination of ___. The patient is now status post 
sternotomy 
and the heart shadow is moderately enlarged in comparison with 
the 
preoperative examination. Appearance of thoracic aorta 
unchanged. The on 
next previous portable examination remaining pleural densities 
on the left 
base have further regressed. Crowded vascularity in the left 
lower lobe 
posterior segment suggests partial atelectasis but no new 
parenchymal 
infiltrates are seen. The pleural density on the left base 
extends into the posterior pleural sinus with only small 
detectable blunting. No new pulmonary abnormalities are 
identified and no pulmonary vascular congestion is present. 
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory postoperative findings status post 
bypass surgery.  
___. ___ 
Conclusions  
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is 
seen in the left atrial appendage. 
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferoapical and 
anteroapical hypokinesis.
4. . Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are 
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. 
8. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results. 
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing initially for 
slow ventricular response. Preserved biventricular systolic 
function post-cpb. LVEF = 55%. Improved anterior and lateral 
wall motion. MR is 1+. Aortic contour is normal post 
decannulation.   
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance 
with ___ regulations.

in summmary had coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with
left internal mammary artery grafted to the diagonal branch of 
the LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to the marginal branch 
and the posterior descending artery.
His bypass time was 60 minutes with a crossclamp time of 47 
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred 
from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable 
condition. He remained sedated on the day of surgery because of 
a mild respiratory acidosis. His sedation was weaned and he was 
extubated on the morning of POD1. After extubation he remained 
in the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring seconadary to bradycardia 
requiring Apacing to maintain his blood pressure. During this 
time he also had an episode of post-operative atrial 
fibrillation, he converted back to sinus rhythm with a bolus of 
amiodarone. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per protocol.
He was transferred from the ICU to the stepdown floor on POD4. 
Once on the floor he was seen by physical therapy to begin 
increasing his activity level. Gently diuresed toward his preop 
weight. The remainder of his post operative course was 
uneventful and he was cleared for discharge home with visiting 
nurses on POD #6.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
=========
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with past medical history of 
DMII, HTN, CAD, and remote hx of a CABG who presented ___ with 
left middle cerebral artery syndrome, underwent thrombectomy and 
had a prolonged hospital coursein the setting of hemorrhagic 
transformation, dysphagia, and ongoing nutritional issues. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
=================== 
[ ] Pt was started on modafinil to improve day-time alertness, 
please consider stopping this if no improvement is seen 
[ ] Pt discharged w/ ziopatch
[ ] Please continue to have patient evaluated by SLP and 
nutrition to advance her diet as appropiate as her dysphagia 
continues to improve 
[ ] We had extensive conversations with the family that the 
patient was not meeting her nutritional goals prior to discharge 
given her mental status and alertness, the family is aware of 
this and was not interested in an alternate means of nutrition 
(ie.PEG) 
[ ] Please check patients blood pressure at least twice daily 
and uptitrate her blood pressure medications as appropiate 
[ ] Please ensure PCP ___ upon discharge from rehab 
[ ] Pt had intermittent issues w/ urinary retention, please 
bladder scan Q6H and straight cath as needed 
[ ] Pt discharge on insulin sliding scale, please discontinue 
this if not requiring additional insulin 

# Left MCA stroke 
Pt presented ___ with a left MCA syndrome and underwent 
thrombectomy w/ resulting TICI-3 reperfusion, 
Unfortunately, her exam did not dramatically improve s/p 
thrombectomy. She was noted to have an area of infarction that 
encompassed essentially the entirety of her basal ganglia, 
insula, and operculum consistent w/ an infarction of the area of 
the deep branches of the left MCA/incomplete superior division 
of L.MCA infarction. Additionally she was noted to have a small 
punctate focus of infarct in the R. frontal lobe, which raised 
the concern for possible cardioembolic etiology (though could 
also be from the the thrombectomy itself), especially in the 
absence of significant intracranial or extracranial 
atherosclerosis. She was also noted to have an area of 
hemorrhagic transformation. Because of this, the administration 
of an anti-platelet agent was delayed, however she was 
ultimately started on plavix (given the stroke occurred on 
aspirin). Her LDL was 145, and her atorvastatin was increased to 
80mg. A1c was noted to be 6.1. Pt was seen this admission by 
physical therapy and speech therapy. She continued to have a 
dense right sided hemiplegia and a severe global aphasia. She 
was able to understand simple one step commands inconsistently, 
and occasionally able to repeat some phrases. Additionally she 
was often quite sleepy during the day, requiring frequent 
re-cuing to get through a meal or work with therapy. For this 
purpose she was started on modafinil which was uptitrated to 
200mg. Discharged w/ ziopatch which will be followed up. 
- Continue plavix 75mg 
- Continue atorvastatin 80mg 
- Continue modafinil 200mg and uptitrate as able 
[ ] Repeat SLP evals 

#Protein Calorie Malnutrition 
#Dysphagia 
Pt initially had ___ placed for tube feeds and medications, 
eventually her diet was advanced. Despite this her mental status 
remained a barrier to her being able to meet her nutritional 
needs. We had several repeat discussions w/ family about risks 
and benefits of her current nutritional status. We discussed 
that the risks of maintaining a dobhoff for an extended period 
likely don't outweigh the benefits. Family is aware because of 
her mental status, that she may not, and likely will not, be 
able to fully meet her nutritional needs w/o supplementing (ie. 
via ___ or PEG). However, they are willing to accept this 
and patient will
be offered oral supplements, as well as will continue on her 
modafinil to attempt and improve her alertness. They are 
hopeful, as are we all, that her appetite will improve and she 
will be re-evaluated by SLP as well as followed by nutrition 
while in rehab

#Hypertension
Patient was noted to be persistently hypertensive and her BP 
medications were uptitrated. Discharge regimen beow 
- Continue losartan 100 mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to trouble speaking and weakness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  Your stroke affected a part of you 
brain that controls your ability to understand and produce 
language, so you are having a lot of difficulty doing these 
things. Because of the size of your stroke there was also some 
bleeding. 

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are: high cholesterol, hypertension 
(or high blood pressure), and diabetes. 

We are changing your medications as follows:
Added:
- Amlodipine 
- Atorvastatin 
- Plavix 
- Carvedilol 
- Flonase 

Stopped
- Aspirin 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were hospitalized due to trouble speaking and weakness
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result
in a variety of symptoms. Your stroke affected a part of you
brain that controls your ability to understand and produce
language, so you are having a lot of difficulty doing these
things. Because of the size of your stroke there was also some
bleeding.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke.
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk
factors. Your risk factors are: high cholesterol, hypertension
(or high blood pressure), and diabetes.
We are changing your medications as follows:
Added:
- Amlodipine
- Atorvastatin
- Plavix
- Carvedilol
- Flonase
Stopped
- Aspirin
Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur,
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

IMAGING:
CT Head ___:
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the 
brain. No 
contrast was administered. Multiplanar reformatted images were 
generated. 
FINDINGS: Overlying the anterior left cerebral convexity is a 
collection of mixed attenuation material, consistent with 
subdural hematoma. Heterogeneous attenuation likely represents a 
combination of relatively early and late subacute bleeding. The 
lower attenuation material is not CSF density, suggesting the 
hematoma is not chronic. There is approximately 6 mm of 
associated rightward, subfalcine herniation of the midline. The 
underlying sulci demonstrate hemispheric effacement. The left 
lateral ventricle demonstrates mass effect. There are no other 
foci of intracranial hemorrhage. The basilar cisterns are 
symmetric. The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. 
There is no fracture. The mastoid air cells and paranasal 
sinuses are well aerated. Soft tissues are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: Mixture of early and delayed subacute subdural 
hematoma overlying the left anterior convexity, resulting in 6 
mm of rightward subfalcine herniation and midline shift, with 
sulcal effacement and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle. 
This appears stable compared to the recent MR. 

___ Brain ___:
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and 
diffusion 
axial images of the brain were acquired.   
FINDINGS: There is an acute/subacute subdural hematoma seen on 
the left 
extending from frontal to the occipital region. The maximum 
width of the 
hematoma is seen in the frontal region measuring approximately 
18 mm and it is measuring approximately 14 mm in the parietal 
region. The hematoma contains a high T1 and high T2 signal 
indicating subacute hemorrhage. Additionally, low T2 signal 
collection is also seen which indicates acute hemorrhage. There 
is mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere with obliteration 
of sulci. Mild shift of the midline is seen to the right side 
with deformity of the left lateral ventricle. The hematoma 
slightly extends to the interhemispheric fissure posteriorly. 
There is no acute infarct seen. There is no hydrocephalus. Few 
scattered foci of hyperintensity in the white matter of 
nonspecific nature are seen which could indicate early changes 
of small vessel disease. Note is made of increased signal in the 
right sigmoid sinus and proximal jugular vein on FLAIR and 
T2-weighted images. Increased signal is also seen in this region 
on T1 sagittal images. Although this could be secondary to 
artifact it is unusual to have this much hyperintensity on 
T1-weighted images. Thrombosis of the sinus is suspected. To 
further evaluate MRV of the head or CTA venography of the head 
and neck are recommended. CT venography of the 
head and neck may provide further information . 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Left-sided acute/subacute subdural hematoma extending from 
frontal to the occipital region with maximum width of 1.8 cm. 
Tiny right frontal subdural is also seen. 
2. Abnormal signal in the right sigmoid sinus and proximal 
jugular vein 
suspicious for thrombosis. Further evaluation with CT venography 
of the head and neck recommended. 
3. Mild changes of small vessel disease. 
4. Mild midline shift to the right. 

CTA/V of Head/Neck ___:
TECHNIQUE: Axial acquired images were obtained through the brain 
without 
contrast followed by post-contrast images through the brain and 
neck per CTB protocol. Coronal and sagittal reformations were 
evaluated.   
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Evolving 
mixed acute 
and chronic left subdural hematoma displays no significant 
interval change in size from prior exam. The degree of mass 
effect on the adjacent sulci as well as subfalcine herniation 
measuring approximately 6-7 mm is also stable. No new 
parenchymal abnormalities are identified. Mass effect on the 
left occipital and temporal horns is stable. Globes and soft 
tissues are unremarkable. Mild right sphenoid sinus mucosal 
thickening is noted with remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid 
air cells appearing unremarkable. Small mucous retention cysts 
are also present within the right and left maxillary sinuses. 
Post contrast administration, there is no thrombosis of the 
venous sinuses with appropriate filling of the sigmoid sinuses 
bilaterally. The posterior circulation appears codominant. The 
right PCA displays a fetal-type configuration. Anterior 
circulation is unremarkable with no aneurysmal dilatation noted. 
A somewhat prominent left cortical vein is noted, likely 
appearing more prominent, related to the adjacent subdural 
hematoma. No AV malformation is present. 
CT OF THE NECK WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Jugular veins are 
patent. Included portions of the aortic arch and great vessel 
origins are normal. There is no flow-limiting stenoses involving 
the origins of the vertebral arteries or internal carotid 
arteries. Soft tissue structures within the neck are 
unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are 
present. Mild-to-moderate bilateral periodontal disease is 
noted. The septum is noted to be rightward deviated with mild 
spur formation causing mass effect on the right inferior 
turbinate. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No significant interval change to acute on chronic evolving 
left subdural hematoma with stable rightward subfalcine 
herniation. 
2. Patent jugular veins bilaterally. Patent venous sinuses. The 
abnormality seen on MRI was likely due to flow artifact. 

Head CT ___:
FINDINGS: There has been interval left frontal craniotomy, with 
evacuation of a left subdural hematoma. There is a postoperative 
changes within the left subdural space, residual left subdural 
collection, consisting of air, and residual blood products, 
measuring approximately 13 mm in maximal ___. Local mass 
effect on adjacent sulci, with mild sulcal effacement is 
unchanged. There is a rightward subfalcine herniation of 
approximately 4 mm, which is improved from prior study 
(previously 7 mm). No additional foci of hemorrhage are 
identified. The caliber of the ventricular system is stable, 
without evidence of new hydrocephalus. No infarct is identified. 
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally 
aerated. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Status post evacuation of the left subdural hematoma, with 
postoperative pneumocephalus, and residual blood products within 
the left subdural space, measuring approximately 13 mm in 
maximal ___. 
2. Improvement in rightward subfalcine herniation, with 
herniation of 
approximately 4 mm. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ admitted to the Neurosurgery service after complaining of a 
history of recurrent headache and word finding difficutly. CT of 
the head was done revealing a left sided acute on chronic SDH.  
MRI was also performed at the OSH prior to transfer.  Radiology 
reading at ___ had a question of sinus flow-signal 
abnormailty, so a CTA/V of the head and neck to rule out jugular 
thrombosis. This study ultimately proved to be negative. He was 
admitted to the neurosurgery floor with plans to take him to the 
operating room on the subsequent day for left sided crani for 
evacuation of blood components. 

On ___, he was taken to the OR and recovered in the ICU 
overnight. The patient was kept flat for 24 hours and was placed 
on a non-rebreather mask at 100% for 24 hours for 
pneumocephalus. He was transferred to the neurosurgical floor on 
___. The patient ambulated with nursing assistance and did very 
well. Overnight the patient hit his head on the side rail. He 
did not lose consciousness and his neuro exam was unchanged. 
Therefore a head CT was not performed. 

The following day he was ambulating on his own with no 
difficulty. His wound looked clean, dry, and intact. There did 
not appear to be any disruption from striking his head 
overnight. Neurologically he had no deficits and was deemed 
ready for discharge. His dilantin level was slightly low on the 
day of discharge so the patient received a bolus and his dose 
was increased. He went home with his wife on ___.

approximately 4 mm, which is improved from prior study
(previously 7 mm). No additional foci of hemorrhage are
identified. The caliber of the ventricular system is stable,
without evidence of new hydrocephalus. No infarct is identified.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally
aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post evacuation of the left subdural hematoma, with
postoperative pneumocephalus, and residual blood products within
the left subdural space, measuring approximately 13 mm in
maximal ___.
2. Improvement in rightward subfalcine herniation, with
herniation of
approximately 4 mm.
Brief Hospital Course:
___ admitted to the Neurosurgery service after complaining of a
history of recurrent headache and word finding difficutly. CT of
the head was done revealing a left sided acute on chronic SDH.
MRI was also performed at the OSH prior to transfer. Radiology
reading at ___ had a question of sinus flow-signal
abnormailty, so a CTA/V of the head and neck to rule out jugular
thrombosis. This study ultimately proved to be negative. He was
admitted to the neurosurgery floor with plans to take him to the
operating room on the subsequent day for left sided crani for
evacuation of blood components.
On ___, he was taken to the OR and recovered in the ICU
overnight. The patient was kept flat for 24 hours and was placed
on a non-rebreather mask at 100% for 24 hours for
pneumocephalus. He was transferred to the neurosurgical floor on
___. The patient ambulated with nursing assistance and did very
well. Overnight the patient hit his head on the side rail. He
did not lose consciousness and his neuro exam was unchanged.
Therefore a head CT was not performed.
The following day he was ambulating on his own with no
difficulty. His wound looked clean, dry, and intact. There did
not appear to be any disruption from striking his head
overnight. Neurologically he had no deficits and was deemed
ready for discharge. His dilantin level was slightly low on the
day of discharge so the patient received a bolus and his dose
was increased. He went home with his wife on ___.

not fully 
characterized, ? fibrous dysplasia, intraosseous lipoma, or bone 
infarct. If clinically indicated, followup radiograph in six

.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old F w/ h/o dementia, RA, afib, transferred from OSH 
with bilateral supracondylar femur fracture on ___.

   On ___, patient presented to ED and received intravenous 
pain medication carefully. The patient also received steroids 
because she has been on steroids recently.  Her lactate was 
normal. She was admitted to the orthopedic
surgery service. Her blood pressure was stable in the emergency 
department. She was ordered for 1U PRBCs at 3pm given crit drop 
31->26. Orthopaedics team ordered that patient to be NPO, added 
her on to OR schedule, placed in bilateral knee immobilizers, 
finalized consent with daughter, b/l ORIF, ordered preop 
labs/EKG/CXR, and continue macrobid for UTI.
   She was taken to the OR with Orthopaedics for fixation of her 
bilateral distal femur fractures. She was brought to the 
operating room, was given general anesthesia placed in the 
supine position on her stretcher.
There was much difficulty with getting access to her and 
anesthesia had to place a central line in the subclavian area.  
Her pulse was quite rapid and there was difficulty controlling 
her blood pressure and difficulty establishing good access.  She 
was given a unit of blood, but  given her labile pressures and 
tachycardia, decision was made to hold off on the open 
treatment.  At this point, Ortho team elected to hold both femur 
fractures reduced with traction and knee immobilizers were 
placed.  Plan was to bring her back to the intensive care unit 
for supportive care and consider fixation in the future. The 
patient was taken to the TSICU floor for close observation and 
care under sedation and intubated.
  On ___, the patient was transfused 1u pRBC for HCT drop from 
29.4 to 23.2 in TSICU. She was made NPO overnight for planned 
procedure on ___. A surface echo was ordered to evaluate 
cardiac function in setting of recent hypotension (SBP 50) and 
tachycardia (HR 160) showing Relatively small left ventricle 
with hyperdynamic systolic function; Mild mitral regurgitation; 
Borderline dilation of the right ventricle with moderate 
tricuspid regurgitation. An US of gallbladder was ordered 
showing Cholelithiasis with no sonographic signs of 
cholecystitis and No biliary dilatation seen. 
  On ___, the patient went to the OR and underwent an 
attempted open reduction and internal fixation of left 
periprosthetic supracondylar femur fracture (aborted), closed 
reduction of left femur fracture, open reduction and internal 
fixation of right supracondylar periprosthetic femur fracture. 
Given comminution of the lateral aspect of the femur, 
intraoperative consultation was obtained with one of our 
arthroplastic specialists, Dr. ___.  After formal 
consultation over the telephone, we discussed the options 
including supplementary fixation with bone cement, the option 
for a revision left total knee in the form of a distal
femoral replacement, provisional stabilization with an external 
fixator versus closed reduction.  After consultation with Dr. 
___ elected to proceed with a closed reduction of the 
left femur. She was provisionally going to return to the 
operating room in the next ___ to ___ 
for possible
distal femoral replacement, revision left total knee 
arthroplasty.
  On ___, blood culture results came back positive (from ___ 
show enterococcus, gram(-) rods, gram(+) cocci). Urine cultures 
were also positive ___ shows gram(-) rods). On ___, results 
finalized with positive cultures showing enterococcus, 
moragnella ___, coag neg staph. Antibiotics continued 
appropriately with Meropenem.
  
On ___ pt was called out to regular floor.  In the afternoon, 
pt was found unresponsive, with PEA arrest.  A code was called.  
Pt was intubated.  CPR was given for 5 mins, 1 mg epi and stress 
dose hydrocortisol were given.  Pulse was palpated afterwards 
without defibrillation.  Pt was ___ transferred to MICU.  
Central access was established, and pt was initially pressors.  
Post-code labs were consistent with acute shock liver and 
myocardial injury post arrest.  She was supported with pressor 
and mechanical ventilation.  However, no meaningful return of 
neurological function was observed - she had roving eyes without 
any evidence of higher cortical function during her ICU stay 
post-arrest, concerning for significant hypoxemia brain injury. 
On ___, she manifested a progressive elevation in her 
lactate, increasing pressor requirements, and evidence of 
evolving multiorgan failure. Given her lack of neurological 
function and her overall dire clinical course, her family was 
notified, came in and during a family meeting the consensus 
decision was made to transition to CMO.  Ventilator support was 
withdrawn on ___.  Pt expired at 10:22 AM on ___ with 
her family at the bedside. Autopsy was declined.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ otherwise healthy male who was assault early ___ morning by 
friend while intoxicated, presented to ED with head laceration 
and AFib with RVR to the 180s, transferred to ___ where trauma 
work-up was otherwise negative. Treated with digoxin and 
converted to sinus rhythm, transferred to medicine for 
management.

# Trauma to head and left body: Pt was assaulted with hit to 
left side of face near eye and subsequent fall to ground on same 
side causing head laceration. On arrival to the ED patient 
received 2 units of PRBCs for scalp bleeding prior to bedside 
suturing and stapling that repaired the laceration. Hct remained 
stable following transfusion. CT head showed mod 
ventriculomegaly and mild enlargement of cerebral sulci without 
signs of acute bleed or intracranial hematoma. CT C-spine and 
CXR were negative. Pt complained of left-sided pain from fall 
with tenderness on exam however left rib films and left humerus 
films were negative. Pt was stabilized and subsequently 
transferred to the medicine service. Over the next several days 
he complained of mild lightheadedness with a sensation of 
disequilibrium, most likely due to head trauma with mild 
post-concussive syndrome symptoms. Pt was rehydrated with IV 
fluids. Pain was controlled with oral oxycodone. He was weaned 
off supplemental oxygen and was satting well on room air. His 
symptoms gradually improved with only mild residual headache 
near laceration at the time of discharge without lightheadedness 
or dizziness. His left sided musculoskeletal symptoms also 
improved and patient was able to ambulate independently. Patient 
was discharged home with limited number of oxycodone pills 
(#15). He has follow-up scheduled with a new PCP at ___. He will 
need to follow-up with Trauma Surgery on ___ for staple 
removal. 

# Paroxsymal Afib with RVR, provoked: Pt has no known cardiac 
history or previous documented episodes of atrial fibrillation. 
Patient was tachycardic on initial exam, found to be in atrial 
fibrillation on admission to TSICU with RVR to the 180's. His 
blood pressures were initially soft. He was loaded with digoxin 
and converted to sinus rhythm within 12 hours of arrival. Blood 
pressures subsequently stabilized. Patient was transferred to 
medicine and remained in sinus rhythm with HR in 70's-90's for 
the remainder of his hospitalization. Trigger for atrial 
fibrillation was most likely the acute stress of trauma in the 
setting of heavy alcohol ingestion. Given conversion to sinus 
rhythm, CHADS score of 0 and recent trauma, the patient was not 
started on systemic anticoagulation. However, this episode of 
atrial fibrillation puts him at higher risk for developing an 
arrhythmia in the future. 

# Alcohol abuse: Pt was intoxicated on presentation to ED with 
EtOH of 261. He got in fight with friends while drinking heavily 
which led to his presentation. He reported 6 beers/day two days 
a week on average. He denied history of severe withdrawal 
symptoms, seizures or DT. He was started on a phenobarbital 
taper, thiamine, folate and multivitamin while in the TSICU. 
Following transfer to medicine he remained clear and coherent on 
exam. His phenobarbital taper was discontinued given relatively 
low risk for severe withdrawal symptoms after further history. 
Pt did not show any signs of withdrawal during remained of 
hospitalization, although phenobarbital likely remained in his 
system during this time given long half-life. It was later 
discovered that the patient is, in fact, homeless, which 
increases his risk for abusing alcohol and other substances. 
Prior to discharge patient was counseled regarding safe drinking 
guidelines and was seen by social work. He will need continued 
support in outpatient follow-up. 

# Transaminitis: Noted to have elevated ALT 90, AST 77 with 
normal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin on admission 
labs. These values downtrended slightly to ALT 50, AST 37 prior 
to discharge. The most likely cause of transaminitis was acute 
alcohol intake. CK not elevated to level to suggest 
rhabdomyolysis or muscule tissue injury as cause. Hepatitis 
serologies (B and C) returned negative. LFTs should be repeated 
as an outpatient with continued work-up. 

# Hypoglycemia: Pt was hypoglycemic to 58 on ___ in the 
setting of prolonged fast after transfer from TSICU, remained 
asymptomatic. Alcohol intoxication/withdrawal possibly 
contributed to hypoglycemia due to inhibition of hepatic 
gluconeogenesis. Blood glucose responded appropriately to oral 
sugar intake. Hypoglycemia resolved and BG remained normal 
during last several days of hospitalization with resumption of 
normal diet. 

# Nicotine withdrawal: Reported smoking 2 cigarettes a day 
currently. Pt declined nicotine patch while hospitalized. Will 
need continued smoking cessation counseling as an outpatient. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Gave limited number of oxycodone 5mg for pain relief (15) on 
discharge
# Recheck LFTs, continue work-up as outpatient
# Hep B and C serologies negative, consider Hep B vaccine series
# Started patient on folate, thiamine, MV during this 
hospitalization given alcohol use
# Continue counseling regarding safe drinking guidelines and 
smoking cessation counseling
# Pt currently homeless, living at ___
# Has been out of care for some time (without PCP) so will need 
to catch up on health maintenance issues when he establishes 
care
# Follow-up appointment scheduled with General Surgery for 
staple removal on ___
# Contact: Brother ___ ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

You were admitted to ___ after 
you fell and hit your head, causing a cut on your scalp. This 
was stapled by the Surgery team. You had several imaging studies 
including a CAT scan of your head, an X-RAY of your chest and 
several other bone X-RAYS that did not show any bleeding or 
broken bones. While you were in the ICU you were given fluids 
and a medication called phenobarbital to make sure that you did 
not withdraw from alcohol. Your liver function tests were found 
to be elevated, most likely because of your alcohol intake. 
Please use caution when consuming alcohol in the future, limit 
excessive alcohol intake to prevent future complications. While 
you were here you went into an irregular heart rhythm and your 
heart started beating too fast. We treated you with medication 
and your heart rate went back to normal. This may put you at 
increased risk for abnormal heart rhythms in the future. We have 
scheduled you with a new primary care doctor for follow-up. You 
have an follow-up appointment with Trauma Surgery (Dr. ___ on 
___, at which time your staples will be removed. We will give 
you a small amount of pain medication after you leave - if you 
need more you will need to discuss this with your primary care 
doctor. Please attend your follow-up appointments as scheduled. 
It was a pleasure taking care of you - we wish you all the best. 


Sincerely, 
Your ___ Medicine Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
You were admitted to ___ after
you fell and hit your head, causing a cut on your scalp. This
was stapled by the Surgery team. You had several imaging studies
including a CAT scan of your head, an X-RAY of your chest and
several other bone X-RAYS that did not show any bleeding or
broken bones. While you were in the ICU you were given fluids
and a medication called phenobarbital to make sure that you did
not withdraw from alcohol. Your liver function tests were found
to be elevated, most likely because of your alcohol intake.
Please use caution when consuming alcohol in the future, limit
excessive alcohol intake to prevent future complications. While
you were here you went into an irregular heart rhythm and your
heart started beating too fast. We treated you with medication
and your heart rate went back to normal. This may put you at
increased risk for abnormal heart rhythms in the future. We have
scheduled you with a new primary care doctor for follow-up. You
have an follow-up appointment with Trauma Surgery (Dr. ___ on
___, at which time your staples will be removed. We will give
you a small amount of pain medication after you leave - if you
need more you will need to discuss this with your primary care
doctor. Please attend your follow-up appointments as scheduled.
It was a pleasure taking care of you - we wish you all the best.
Sincerely,
Your ___ Medicine Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ h/o CAD s/p MI and LAD/RCA stents, paroxysmal SVT s/p 
ablation, DMII, hx of Graves disease, s/p thyroidectomy, 
currently with post-surgical hypothyroid on replacement who 
presents from ___ clinic with dyspnea and persistent 
bilateral leg edema.

# AMA Discharge: Patient left AMA the night before planned 
discharge because of complaints of 'anaphylaxis' from an 
adjacent patient's flowers. At the time, patient was breathing 
comfortably with good O2 saturation, and there were no other 
clinical signs of anaphylaxis or allergic reaction. She was 
given PRN benadryl dose prior to her decision to leave.

# Lower extremity and abdominal bloating: Etiology not entirely 
clear, her edema was predominantly non-pitting. Iatrogenic 
hyperthyroidism from high doses of levothyroxine thought to be a 
potential etiology. Lower extremity myxedema can occur with 
hyperthyroidism. She had begun to decrease her dose at her last 
hospitalization, so she was maintained at the same dose of 
275mcg to avoid weaning her too quickly. There was no evidence 
of heart failure on work-up at OSH (nl echo, nl proBNP). We also 
considered NAFLD given evidence of fatty infiltration on prior 
imaging, however her LFTs were wnl and she had no ascites on 
ultrasound. She responded well to IV Bumex when hospitalized at 
OSH, but continued to reaccumulate edema on oral diuretics. She 
was started here on IV Lasix and was then transitioned to PO 
torsemide given its better PO bioavailability. She responded 
well to IV lasix as well as PO torsemide. Her ___ abdominal US 
revealed no ascites, but an echogenic liver c/w fatty liver 
disease. Her 11pm cortisol was low-normal, suggesting she does 
not have hypercortisolism. She was given a prescription of PO 
torsamide for continued out-patient diuresis of her lower 
extremity edema. She will follow-up with her outpatient 
endocrinologist for ongoing levothyroxine taper.
.
# Graves' disease s/p thyroidectomy: TSH very suppressed at OSH 
at 0.10. She is on large dose of levothyroxine prior to 
admission, just decreased from 300->275mcg at OSH. We did not 
further taper her levothyroxine on this admission to avoid 
decreasing her thyroid hormone levels too quickly, but will 
encourage her to schedule out-patient follow-up with her 
endocrinologist.

# Dyspnea: She was initially complaining of some dyspnea when 
she was first admitted. However, during her entire 
hospitalization she was satting well on RA. Her ambulatory O2 
Sat was 94-97%.

# DMII: We held her home oral agents and kept her on an insulin 
sliding scale during her hospitalization.

# CAD s/p PCI: Continued her home ASA, statin, and atenolol 
during her hospitalization. We stopped her imdur due to 
headaches.

# Code status: FULL
# Emergency contact: ___ (husband) Phone number: 
___, Cell phone: ___ 

# Transitional issues:
-Continue levothyroxine taper
-Monitor electrolytes and creatinine after discharge given that 
she was started on torsemide

Greetings Mrs. ___, 

___ were admitted to the ___ ED on ___ fr persistent leg 
swelling and some shortness of breath. This was the same morning 
following a recent admission to ___ for 
similar symptoms and chest pain where they diuresed ___ with 
lasix and discharged ___ on oral lasix at home. Your work-up 
here revealed no cardiac or liver related cause of your edema, 
and imaging revealed no abdominal ascites (swelling). ___ did 
respond well to IV l=Lasix, and we transitioned ___ to a 
different oral diuretic called torsamide that should have better 
gut absorption to help treat your edema. As ___ know, your TSH 
was very low at AJH despite your high dose of replacement 
thyroid hormone, and ___ will have to follow-up with your 
endocrinologist for continued management.

Final Comments:
1. SElective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system revealed three vessel native coronary artery disease. The 
LMCA
had diffuse moderate disease. The LAD was occluded at the 
origin; the
distal vessel fills via the LIMA without significant disease. A 
very
small diagonal branch fills from SVG-OM jump graft. The Lcx av 
groove
branch had moderate diffuse disease. The marginal branches were
occluded; the major OM fills via the SVG without significant 
disease
with collaterals to smaller distal marginal. The RCA was 
occluded
proximally with the distal portion of the vessel filling via the 
SVG-PDA
graft.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic 
hypertension
with a central pressure of 173/88 mmHg.
3. Saphenous vein graft angiography revealed the SVG-PDA to have 
a 90%
mid vessel lesion as well as more distal haxy 70% lesion just 
prior to
the previously placed stent; the stent was widely patent. The
SVG-diagonal-OM graft had a 90% proximal lesion with sequential 
80% and
60% hazy stenoses more distally.
4. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA-LAD to be 
patent
without angiographically apparent disease.
5. Successful stenting of the distal SVG-RCA with a 4.0x28 mm 
Promus DES
as well stenting of the proximal SVG-RCA with a 4.0x23mm Promus 
DES.
6. Successful stenting of the distal SVG-diag-OM graft with a 
4.0x28mm
Promus DES and stenting of the proximal SVG-diag-OM with a 
4.0x15mm
Promus DES.
7. Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy with ___ 
perclose
device.
 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systemic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old with history of CAD s/p CABG and history of PCI, 
type II DM, HTN, HL admitted with NSTEMI. 
  
#. Coronary artery disease, NSTEMI: On arrival to the floor, 
patient was chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.  He was 
treated with aspirin, beta blocker, plavix, statin and heparin 
gtt.  There was a question of aspirin allergy, but his 
cardiologist's office and his PCP's office had no record of 
aspirin allergy, so he was given full strength aspirin with no 
adverse reaction.  Cardiac biomarkers were flat.  Cardiac 
catheterization was performed and showed severe stenosis of a 
vein graft to OM and a vein graft to the RCA, and two drug 
eluting stents were placed in each graft.  Patient experienced 
some chest pain during the procedure with mild post-procedural 
cardiac enzyme elevation.  He was started on metoprolol and 
aspirin.  His pravastatin was increased to 80 mg daily.  

# Ischemic cardiac myopathy.  Patient received an echo on 
___ which showed EF of 40%.  He was started on metoprolol 
and lisinopril.  

# Hypertension.  Patient had markedly elevated blood pressure in 
the cath lab, requiring nitroglycerin drip.  Patient was also 
started on metoprolol and lisinopril for blood pressure control. 
 His blood pressure should be monitored after discharge, and his 
antihypertensive medications should be adjusted as necessary.  

#. Diabetes: Patient oral hypglycemics were held and he was 
treated with sliding scale humalog with qid fingersticks.  His 
HgA1C was 9.3. He is discharged with 1000 mg metformin twice 
daily.  His diabetic regimen should be titrated in outpatient 
setting.  

# Depression: Patient was continued on citalopram, mirtazapine 
and trazodone.

Final Comments:
1. SElective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system revealed three vessel native coronary artery disease. The
LMCA
had diffuse moderate disease. The LAD was occluded at the
origin; the
distal vessel fills via the LIMA without significant disease. A
very
small diagonal branch fills from SVG-OM jump graft. The Lcx av
groove
branch had moderate diffuse disease. The marginal branches were
occluded; the major OM fills via the SVG without significant
disease
with collaterals to smaller distal marginal. The RCA was
occluded
proximally with the distal portion of the vessel filling via the
SVG-PDA
graft.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic
hypertension
with a central pressure of 173/88 mmHg.
3. Saphenous vein graft angiography revealed the SVG-PDA to have
a 90%
mid vessel lesion as well as more distal haxy 70% lesion just
prior to
the previously placed stent; the stent was widely patent. The
SVG-diagonal-OM graft had a 90% proximal lesion with sequential
80% and
60% hazy stenoses more distally.
4. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA-LAD to be
patent
without angiographically apparent disease.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ woman who is otherwise healthy, who 
presents to the ED with vision loss ongoing for the last 5 days 
or so.

Symptoms first began in early ___. She first noticed some 
possible swelling of her face bilaterally in the cheeks.  Her 
husband agrees that he noticed swelling as well.  Shortly 
thereafter, she noticed that her jaw was painful especially when 
opening.  She denies feelings of her jaw locking or getting 
stuck when chewing.  The symptoms were present on both sides of 
her jaw.  She also experienced some feelings of pressure in the 
ears. In addition, she had some soreness in the back of her head 
and neck area.  She describes this not really as a pain but more 
of a tenderness to palpation.  She denies headache, but does 
also note that her temples are tender to the touch.

She was initially seen in her primary care doctor's office where 
she was diagnosed with sinusitis and given antibiotics.  At some 
point, the facial swelling to get better but the remainder of 
her symptoms persisted.  She was thought to have possible TMJ 
dysfunction.

However, since the beginning of this week, either ___ or 
___, she has noticed a ""gray veil"" coming up from the 
inferior aspect of her visual field in the left eye.  She is 
quite positive that this is only in the left eye and symptoms go 
away if she covers left eye.  The symptoms have been constant 
but
seem to have progressed to the point that now almost the entire 
bottom half of her visual field on the left side is gray.  She 
feels she has lost vision in the left side as she has been 
bumping into things on her left past few days. 

Because of the symptoms, she spoke with her PCP who referred her 
to the emergency department for evaluation.

She denies any pain in the eye or painful eye movements.  She 
denies sensitivity in the eye or sensation of foreign body.  She 
denies any positive visual phenomena other than those listed 
above.  She continues to endorse tenderness in the left neck, 
scalp, and temporal area.

Single lifetime seizure, approximately ___ years ago.  She states
she had a full workup including MRI and EEG but these were
unrevealing.

___ CXR :
As compared to ___ radiograph, a small to moderate 
left 
pneumothorax is similar when considerations are made for 
differences in 
positioning and lung volumes.  Left chest tube remains in place. 
 Slight 
worsening of left basilar atelectasis with otherwise similar 
appearance of the 
chest 

___ Chest CT :
Motion limited exam. 
  
Status post left VATS and left upper lobectomy with a moderate 
anterior left hemothorax with no evidence of active bleeding. 
  
Moderate anterior left pneumothorax with left lateral approach 
chest tube in the posterior pleural space. 
  
Endobronchial mucous plugging contributes to left lower lobe 
partial 
atelectasis. 
  
Increased right upper and right lower lobe ground-glass 
opacities may be due to edema, infection or aspiration. 
  
New trace right pleural effusion with adjacent mild passive 
atelectasis. 
  
Stable bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. 
  
Stable dilatation of the main pulmonary artery suggests 
pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
  
Stable fusiform dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta to 
4.3 cm with 
presence of aortic valvular calcifications may suggest aortic 
stenosis. 
  
___ CXR :
Increased opacification of the left hemithorax with a probably 
enlarging 
anterior superior loculated fluid collection. 

___ Video swallow :
Intermittent penetration with thin liquids

___ CXR :
The fluid collection in the left upper hemithorax, where there 
has been 
posterior rib resection, moderate dependent left pleural 
effusion, and poor 
aeration of the left lung have been relatively unchanged for 
week. 
  
Right lung consolidation, just above the minor fissure, is also 
relatively stable, but overall right lung volume has improved 
and there is no longer any pulmonary edema.  Another focus of 
pneumonia may be developing at the right lung base and should be 
monitored closely.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  
Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement.  There is no 
pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___ Mr. ___ came to the hospital for an elective 
admission and underwent an exploratory thoracoscopy, left 
thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy, chest wall resection, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection, intercostal muscle flap 
buttress, and bronchoscopy with lavage with Dr. ___ 
Dr. ___.  He tolerated the procedure well and it was 
completed without complication.  Postoperatively he had an 
epidural placed for pain control.  He was extubated and 
transferred from the OR to the TSICU.

Postoperatively, a bedside swallow evaluation was performed on 
POD1 and he was started on a dysphagia diet. On POD2, his 
pressors were weaned and one of the chest tubes removed. On 
POD3, his respiratory status worsened, and he was intubated. 
Central line, A-line, and oral gastric tube were placed, and the 
epidural was replaced. Bedside bronchoscopy was performed for 
left lower lobe collapse which improved afterwards. Antibiotics 
were started for presume pneumonia possibly secondary to 
aspiration. POD4, oral gastric tube feeds were started, and he 
had improve mucous secretion. Late in the evening, he 
self-extubated and was saturating well with good secretion 
management. POD5, morning CXR showed worsening opacity and CT 
chest showed a left hemothorax. A pigtail catheter was placed 
into the clot with drainage. Later that day, he began showing 
signs of increased work of breathing. He was reintubated and 
bronchoscopy was performed with secretions sent for culture 
again. On POD6, he was given 1u packed red blood cells and a 
dose of lasix for diuresis. He underwent bronchoscopy again on 
POD8, and blood/urine cultures were sent for elevated WBC to 
21.5. After discussion with the family and consent was obtained, 
he was taken to the operating room for a tracheostomy and PEG 
tube placement. Morning of POD9, bronchoscopy was performed. He 
tolerated approximately 4 hours of trach mask before showing 
signs of increased respiratory effort. The anterior pigtail 
placed to drain the hemothorax was removed. POD10, bronchoscopy 
was again performed with minimal mucous removal. POD11, the 
remaining chest tube which had been draining minimal 
serosanguinous fluid was removed. Per ID recommendations, 
antibiotics were removed on POD 13 as Mr. ___ remained 
afebrile with stable vital signs and no culture growths. On POD 
14, he underwent a green dye swallowing test and subsequently a 
video swallow test on POD ___spiration from 
swallowing if any; however barium was aspirated from his 
tracheostomy, so he remained NPO. A repeat swallow evaluation 
was done on ___ and he did well with thin liquids and 
pureed solids.  The barium that was suctioned out of his trach 
after his prior video swallow was likely from esophageal 
dysmotility/reflux and may need further work up.  
recommendations at this time include giving Mr. ___ sips of 
liquids and meds can be crushed in pureed.  His diet can slowly 
be advanced as his strength improves.  I*n the interim he 
continues to receive 100% of his caloric needs from Nepro cycled 
at 80 cc's/hr over 18 hrs. via PEG tube.

From a neurologic standpoint he continues on his ___ meds 
though they have been adjusted during this hospitalization.  He 
has periods of delirium and confusion but is 100% improved over 
a week ago.  Generally during the day he is out of bed, 
conversant and seems at his cognitive baseline.  He occasionally 
has periods of confusion at night but is better with Seraquel.

His left thoracotomy site is healing well except for a small 
area of skin separation superiorly which will need to be 
watched.  Currently the area is dry, without erythema but should 
be covered with a DSD if it starts to drain.

After a long ICU stay he was discharged to rehab on ___ to 
continue pulmonary toilet as well as physical therapy to 
increase his strength and mobility.  He will follow up with Dr. 
___ in the ___ Clinic in ___ days.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with Factor V Leiden, splenic infarct s/p 
splenectomy, chronic abdominal pain requiring narcotics, and 
portal vein thrombosis presenting with acute on chronic 
abdominal pain and nausea. 

In ___, patient presented to an OSH with LUQ pain and 
was found to have splenic infarct and splenic vein thrombosis 
requiring splenectomy. She was diagnosed with factor V Leiden 
disorder. She was discharged on lovenox and warfarin, and she 
states she has been taking these consistently, but usually has 
subtherapeutic INR. She has also been on chronic narcotics, 
using oxycodone 30mg Q4hrs since ___ due to persistent 
LUQ abdominal pain, which she attributes to having her ""organs 
stuck together"" as a side-effect of her splenectomy. 

The history of her present illness dates to approximately 2 
weeks prior to presentation, when she presented to ___ 
___ following one day of right sided abdominal pain 
associated with nausea and vomiting, worse with food (causing 
her to have decreased PO intake). She cannot give details of the 
diagnostic work-up or management during this hospitalization, 
but she was on a PCA for pain control and had a CT of the 
abdomen. She was discharged after 6 days, and felt that her pain 
was improved at the time of discharge, but had continued daily 
nausea and vomiting. She was continued on her outpatient regimen 
of oxycodone 30mg Q4hrs and given addition oxycodone 15mg TID 
for breakthrough pain.  She had manageable pain for one day 
after discharge, and then had 3 more days of worsening pain, 
causing her to re-present to the ___ ED on ___. 
She had no relief from Oxycodone QID and breakthrough oxycodone 
(15mg TID PRN), and was given dilaudid. Labs were notable for 
lipase 65, normal electrolytes and renal function; AST 50, ALT 
70, Alk phos 120, bili 0.2, INR of 0.9, and normal PTT.  She was 
transferred to ___ for further management of her abdominal 
pain. 

She states that she has continued pain and nausea, but has not 
vomited because she has not been eating. She has not had 
diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia. 

In the ED initial vitals were: 98 70 110/67 20 96%. Labs were 
notable for mild transaminitis. RUQ ultrasound showed 
nonocclusive thrombus in portal vein.   Patient was given 
dilaudid and zofran and trasnferred to the floor.  

On the floor, the pt reports continued severe RLQ abd pain.

Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, night sweats, 
headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, 
cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, 
hematuria.

right hepatic lobe andlateral to the hepatic flexure of the 
colon may represent a small omentalinfarct, which could be the 
source of the patient's pain.

MICROBIOLOGY:
======================
Blood cultures x 2 ___ negative on ___CTIVE ISSUES:
=======================
##Abdominal pain: Her abdominal pain was localized to the right 
periumbilical area, and was severe and out of proportion to 
exam, concerning for ischemia. She had a somewhat distractable 
exam, but had tenderness with even light palpation. She had no 
findings of arterial ischemia on CTA, and no bloody diarrhea, 
and lactate was reassuringly negative. CTA showed chronic 
occlusion of the portal vein with cavernous transformation.  An 
omental infarct near the hepatic flexure of the colon was 
demonstrated on CT, which was thought to represent the source of 
her pain.  She received single doses of ceftriaxone and flagyl 
initially out of concern for bowel ischemia in the setting of 
asplenia, but these were stopped on hospital day 2 when it was 
evident that she did have ischemic bowel injury.  She has been 
on chronic opioids since her splenectomy in ___, requiring 
225mg of oxycodone daily.  She was continued on oxycodone 30mg 
PO Q4hrs and initially had a dilaudid PCA for breakthrough pain, 
which she used for one day before being weaned to oral oxycodone 
45mg Q4hrs.  On hospital day 4 her pain gradually diminished, 
and she was ambulatory in the hall and tolerating meals without 
nausea of vomiting.  She was evaluated by the chronic pain 
service, who felt that she may be developing opioid induced 
hyperalgesia given her recurrent bouts of abdominal pain, and 
recommended that she begin taking pregabalin as an adjunct to 
opiates, and encouraged her to follow-up with an outpatient 
provider who will wean her from her high dose of opioid pain 
medicines. 

#Hypercoagulability: patient has stated history of Factor V 
Leiden and antiphospholipid syndrome.  These diagnoses were not 
able to be verified during this admission.  According to 
patient, she has been told that she has both of these diagnoses. 
 However, she is unable to give the names of the surgeon who 
performed her splenectomy or the hematologist who follows her 
and prescribes her anticoagulation regimen.  She states that she 
has been on warfarin since ___ (medication history in 
OMR shows warfarin prescriptions dating back to ___, as 
well as lovenox since she has not been able to reach therapeutic 
INR.  During this hospitalization, she was shown to have 
cavernous transformation of a chronic portal vein thrombus, as 
well as an SMV thrombus. CTA also demonstrated gastric and 
esophageal varices. She was initially placed on a heparin drip, 
and then transitioned to therapeutic lovenox 80mg SQ BID. She 
was discharged on lovenox. 

Of note anticardiolipin antibodies were negative this admission. 


TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
#hematology follow-up; patient states she is managed by a 
hematologist in ___, but is unable to provide the name 
of this doctor. She states that her hematologist prescribes her 
anticoagulation medications, and that she has a follow-up 
appointment scheduled for ___ with her hematologist. She was 
urged to keep this appointment and to establish a plan for 
anticoagulation.

#Pain management: she was continued on home dose of oxycodone, 
and given an 8 day supply of oxycodone, until she is able to see 
the surgeon who prescribes her oxycodone; she was unable to 
provide the name of this doctor. She will need to follow up with 
this provider for ongoing prescriptions of pain medications. 

#Esophageal and gastric varices: CTA findings this 
hospitalization showed esophageal and gastric varices. She 
should have consultation with a gastroenterologist for possible 
EGD to assess the risk of bleeding from these varices and need 
for possible prophylactic medication. 

#Primary care: patient stated she does not have a primary care 
doctor. Due to the complexity of her hypercoagulable disease, 
she was encouraged to find a primary care doctor within the 
___ system so that all records can 
be shared amongst her outpatient providers, in order to 
coordinate her complex care in the future. 

All of the above was explained to the pt. in detail repeatedly 
on the day of discharge by me in face to face interaction, and 
she verbalized understanding and agreement and all of her 
questions were answered to her satisfaction.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___. You were hospitalized 
for abdominal pain. A CT scan of your abdomen showed that there 
was a small portion of dead tissue in the abdomen that was 
likely causing your pain; this is called an omental infarct, and 
was most likely caused by a blood clot. 

You were continued on Lovenox (enoxaparin) 80mg injected twice a 
day, you received a prescription to continue taking enoxaparin. 
You will also have another prescription for oxycodone for one 
week at your prior dose.  You were started on Lyrica, to treat 
chronic pain, and you will need to take this ___ medication 
twice a day. You will need to see your doctors in ___ 
to get more prescriptions.

Due to the presence of blood clots in your abdomen, you have 
enlargement and swelling of the veins in the stomach and 
esophagus.  You need to make an appointment to see a 
gastroenterologist, who should perform an endoscopy (camera down 
the mouth and esophagus) to examine these veins and determine 
the risk for bleeding from these veins. 

You also must go to the appointments to see your hematologist 
(___) and surgeon (___) to discuss this hospitalization 
and the changes made your medications. We also strongly 
recommend that you find a primary care doctor, who can be the 
main doctor that manages your ongoing medical issues.

right hepatic lobe andlateral to the hepatic flexure of the
colon may represent a small omentalinfarct, which could be the
source of the patient's pain.
MICROBIOLOGY:
======================
Blood cultures x 2 ___ negative on ___CTIVE ISSUES:
=======================
##Abdominal pain: Her abdominal pain was localized to the right
periumbilical area, and was severe and out of proportion to
exam, concerning for ischemia. She had a somewhat distractable
exam, but had tenderness with even light palpation. She had no
findings of arterial ischemia on CTA, and no bloody diarrhea,
and lactate was reassuringly negative. CTA showed chronic
occlusion of the portal vein with cavernous transformation. An
omental infarct near the hepatic flexure of the colon was
demonstrated on CT, which was thought to represent the source of
her pain. She received single doses of ceftriaxone and flagyl
initially out of concern for bowel ischemia in the setting of
asplenia, but these were stopped on hospital day 2 when it was
evident that she did have ischemic bowel injury. She has been
on chronic opioids since her splenectomy in ___, requiring
225mg of oxycodone daily. She was continued on oxycodone 30mg
PO Q4hrs and initially had a dilaudid PCA for breakthrough pain,
which she used for one day before being weaned to oral oxycodone
45mg Q4hrs. On hospital day 4 her pain gradually diminished,
and she was ambulatory in the hall and tolerating meals without
nausea of vomiting. She was evaluated by the chronic pain
service, who felt that she may be developing opioid induced
hyperalgesia given her recurrent bouts of abdominal pain, and
recommended that she begin taking pregabalin as an adjunct to
opiates, and encouraged her to follow-up with an outpatient
provider who will wean her from her high dose of opioid pain
medicines.
#Hypercoagulability: patient has stated history of Factor V
Leiden and antiphospholipid syndrome. These diagnoses were not
able to be verified during this admission. According to
patient, she has been told that she has both of these diagnoses. However, she is unable to give the names of the surgeon who
performed her splenectomy or the hematologist who follows her
and prescribes her anticoagulation regimen. She states that she
has been on warfarin since ___ (medication history in
OMR shows warfarin prescriptions dating back to ___, as
well as lovenox since she has not been able to reach therapeutic
INR. During this hospitalization, she was shown to have
cavernous transformation of a chronic portal vein thrombus, as
well as an SMV thrombus. CTA also demonstrated gastric and
esophageal varices. She was initially placed on a heparin drip,
and then transitioned to therapeutic lovenox 80mg SQ BID. She
was discharged on lovenox.
Of note anticardiolipin antibodies were negative this admission.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
#hematology follow-up; patient states she is managed by a
hematologist in ___, but is unable to provide the name
of this doctor. She states that her hematologist prescribes her
anticoagulation medications, and that she has a follow-up
appointment scheduled for ___ with her hematologist. She was
urged to keep this appointment and to establish a plan for
anticoagulation.
#Pain management: she was continued on home dose of oxycodone,
and given an 8 day supply of oxycodone, until she is able to see
the surgeon who prescribes her oxycodone; she was unable to
provide the name of this doctor. She will need to follow up with
this provider for ongoing prescriptions of pain medications.
#Esophageal and gastric varices: CTA findings this
hospitalization showed esophageal and gastric varices. She
should have consultation with a gastroenterologist for possible
EGD to assess the risk of bleeding from these varices and need
for possible prophylactic medication.
#Primary care: patient stated she does not have a primary care
doctor. Due to the complexity of her hypercoagulable disease,
she was encouraged to find a primary care doctor within the
___ system so that all records can
be shared amongst her outpatient providers, in order to
coordinate her complex care in the future.
All of the above was explained to the pt. in detail repeatedly
on the day of discharge by me in face to face interaction, and
she verbalized understanding and agreement and all of her
questions were answered to her satisfaction.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization
at ___. You were hospitalized
for abdominal pain. A CT scan of your abdomen showed that there
was a small portion of dead tissue in the abdomen that was
likely causing your pain; this is called an omental infarct, and
was most likely caused by a blood clot.
You were continued on Lovenox (enoxaparin) 80mg injected twice a
day, you received a prescription to continue taking enoxaparin.
You will also have another prescription for oxycodone for one
week at your prior dose. You were started on Lyrica, to treat
chronic pain, and you will need to take this ___ medication
twice a day. You will need to see your doctors in ___
to get more prescriptions.
Due to the presence of blood clots in your abdomen, you have
enlargement and swelling of the veins in the stomach and
esophagus. You need to make an appointment to see a
gastroenterologist, who should perform an endoscopy (camera down
the mouth and esophagus) to examine these veins and determine
the risk for bleeding from these veins.
You also must go to the appointments to see your hematologist
(___) and surgeon (___) to discuss this hospitalization
and the changes made your medications. We also strongly
recommend that you find a primary care doctor, who can be the
main doctor that manages your ongoing medical issues.

Studies:
___
Renal U/S:
Extensive bilateral staghorn renal calculi resulting in markedly 

limited exam. Difficultly detecting left renal stent. Recommend 
radiographs for assessment of stent position. 

KUB: 
1. Left nephroureteral stent in appropriate position. No 
right-sided renal 
stent. 
2. Extensive staghorn calculi, with stone burden relatively 
similar to ___. 

CT Ab/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Extensive left perinephric and left ureteral stent stranding 
with fluid 
collection seen adjacent to the left proximal ureter as 
described above. 
Differential diagnosis for fluid collection includes abscess or 
old hematoma or forniceal rupture from renal obstruction. 
2. Calcifications within the distal left ureter adjacent to the 
ureteral 
stent. These could represent ureteral stones or calcifications 
in the wall of the ureter. Contrast enhanced scan and/or direct 
visualization with cystoscopy is recommended to exclude 
malignancy. The ureteral stent is appropriately positioned. No 
evidence of hydronephrosis. 
3. Bilateral staghorn calcifications within atrophic kidneys are 
unchanged. 
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions. 
5. Stable left adrenal mass, likely adenoma. 

___: Lower Extremity ultrasound
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
An ___ year old lady with a history of chronic kidney disease 
from ___ calculi and a recent stent placement admitted with 
worsening renal function and a concern for a renal infection 
with laboratory abnormalities. 

#. Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine 
elevation was evaluated by our Renal team.  They recommended 
hydration with bicarbonate containing fluids to help optimize 
her chronic kidney disease, Kayexalate for worsening potassium 
and consultaton with her home nephrologist on discharge 
(appointment scheduled).  After review of her records, this is 
likely a worsening of her native disease, possibly due to 
inflammation/infection surrounding stent placement.   Dialysis 
was discussed but not required urgently at this time. The 
patient will switch from Calcium carbonate to Renagel as 
prescribed for phosphate control.  She will continue her other 
medications including bicarb and calcitriol.  It is imperative 
that she continues to hydrate herself well, approximately ___ 
glasses of water daily.

#. Renal stent/stones: The patient has evidence of a stone 
adjacent to her stent placement.  This must be followed and our 
Urology team has arranged for outpatient ureteroscopy 
evaluation.  The patient can return to her outpatient urologist 
instead of ___ at her discretion.  Either way, the CT scan 
findings (as above) and stone must be evaluated. Given pyuria 
and foreign body, she will continue Cefpodoxime on discharge for 
4 days to complete a 7 day course (started with Vancomycin, 
Cefepime & Ceftriaxone).

#. Hyperkalemia: The patient's K was elevated to 5.7 without EKG 
changes or symptoms.  She was given Kayexalate (total 60mg over 
1 day) to normalize her K to 4.3.  Please follow the 
Kayexalate/Potassium sliding scale on the discharge orders to 
ensure proper potassium management.  As Kayexalate causes 
dehydration, fluid intake is imperative. 

# Edema: The patient's lower extremity edema is likely a 
complication of renal failure. DVT was ruled out with 
ultrasound. 

# Anemia - The patient's anemia was determined to be chronic due 
to renal disease rather than iron deficiency based on studies. 

#. Hypertension - Continued amlodipine & metoprolol  

#. GERD - continued home protonix

# Pain - continued fentanyl patch
  
# Insomnia - continued trazodone and melatonin.  

# CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI, per patient and daughter.

Studies:
___
Renal U/S:
Extensive bilateral staghorn renal calculi resulting in markedly
limited exam. Difficultly detecting left renal stent. Recommend
radiographs for assessment of stent position.
KUB:
1. Left nephroureteral stent in appropriate position. No
right-sided renal
stent.
2. Extensive staghorn calculi, with stone burden relatively
similar to ___.
CT Ab/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive left perinephric and left ureteral stent stranding
with fluid
collection seen adjacent to the left proximal ureter as
described above.
Differential diagnosis for fluid collection includes abscess or
old hematoma or forniceal rupture from renal obstruction.
2. Calcifications within the distal left ureter adjacent to the
ureteral
stent. These could represent ureteral stones or calcifications
in the wall of the ureter. Contrast enhanced scan and/or direct
visualization with cystoscopy is recommended to exclude
malignancy. The ureteral stent is appropriately positioned. No
evidence of hydronephrosis.
3. Bilateral staghorn calcifications within atrophic kidneys are
unchanged.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
5. Stable left adrenal mass, likely adenoma.
___: Lower Extremity ultrasound
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course:
An ___ year old lady with a history of chronic kidney disease
from ___ calculi and a recent stent placement admitted with
worsening renal function and a concern for a renal infection
with laboratory abnormalities.
#. Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine
elevation was evaluated by our Renal team. They recommended
hydration with bicarbonate containing fluids to help optimize
her chronic kidney disease, Kayexalate for worsening potassium
and consultaton with her home nephrologist on discharge
(appointment scheduled). After review of her records, this is
likely a worsening of her native disease, possibly due to
inflammation/infection surrounding stent placement. Dialysis
was discussed but not required urgently at this time. The
patient will switch from Calcium carbonate to Renagel as
prescribed for phosphate control. She will continue her other
medications including bicarb and calcitriol. It is imperative
that she continues to hydrate herself well, approximately ___
glasses of water daily.
#. Renal stent/stones: The patient has evidence of a stone
adjacent to her stent placement. This must be followed and our
Urology team has arranged for outpatient ureteroscopy
evaluation. The patient can return to her outpatient urologist
instead of ___ at her discretion. Either way, the CT scan
findings (as above) and stone must be evaluated. Given pyuria
and foreign body, she will continue Cefpodoxime on discharge for
4 days to complete a 7 day course (started with Vancomycin,
Cefepime & Ceftriaxone).
#. Hyperkalemia: The patient's K was elevated to 5.7 without EKG
changes or symptoms. She was given Kayexalate (total 60mg over
1 day) to normalize her K to 4.3. Please follow the
Kayexalate/Potassium sliding scale on the discharge orders to
ensure proper potassium management. As Kayexalate causes
dehydration, fluid intake is imperative.
# Edema: The patient's lower extremity edema is likely a
complication of renal failure. DVT was ruled out with
ultrasound.
# Anemia - The patient's anemia was determined to be chronic due
to renal disease rather than iron deficiency based on studies.
#. Hypertension - Continued amlodipine & metoprolol
#. GERD - continued home protonix
# Pain - continued fentanyl patch
# Insomnia - continued trazodone and melatonin.
# CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI, per patient and daughter.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness resulting 
from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a 
clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
Diabetes
High Cholesterol
High Blood pressure
Smoking

We are changing your medications as follows:
Start Lisinopril 5 mg daily 
Start Aspirin 81 mg daily 
Start Atorvastatin 80 mg daily 
Increase Metformin as follows: 
- Start Metformin 500 mg daily for one week (___)
- Increase Metformin 500 mg twice daily for one week (___) 
- Increase to Metformin  1000 mg twice daily ___ - 
indefinitely).

We recommend you stop smoking. 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please followup with Neurology, ___ and your primary care 
physician.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of dizziness resulting
from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a
clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety
of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke.
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk
factors. Your risk factors are:
Diabetes
High Cholesterol
High Blood pressure
Smoking
We are changing your medications as follows:
Start Lisinopril 5 mg daily
Start Aspirin 81 mg daily
Start Atorvastatin 80 mg daily
Increase Metformin as follows:
- Start Metformin 500 mg daily for one week (___)
- Increase Metformin 500 mg twice daily for one week (___)
- Increase to Metformin 1000 mg twice daily ___ -
indefinitely).
We recommend you stop smoking.
Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology, ___ and your primary care
physician.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur,
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a ___ with a known history of severe AS and 3VD. 
Over the last ___ weeks he has been
experiencing worsening dyspnea on exertion, precipitated with 
very
mild activity. He also reported a recent increase in
congestion, particularly in the morning with production of white
phlegm and a cough. He was admitted for a ___ cardiac cath 
which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease and 
severe aortic stenosis. The pt was planned for CABG+/-AVR on 
___.

Today, around noon, the pt had a witnessed arrest. He was 
reportedly unconscious for ~15 minutes without chest 
compression. EMS responded and found the pt to be pulseless in a 
shockable rhythm and he was given one shock (unknown which 
rhythm). During transport to the ED he had another shockable 
rythm and they shocked him again. He also recieved epi x3. He 
was intubated in the field. On arrival to ___ ED he was found 
to be asystolic. He received epi x1 with ROSC. He was then found 
to be in complete heart block with a RBBB escape at a rate of 
40bpm.  With slowing of the sinus rate, he resumed conduction at 
1:1 with a RBBB/LAFB morphology. The pt was started on levophed 
for BPs ___, and was externally paced but was not getting 
great capture and so a transvenous pacer was placed with 
improvement of BPs 120s-130s. He also got atropine x1 and 
calcium chloride. Dopa and Epi were added for further bp 
augmentation. CT surg evaluated the pt in the ED but did not 
feel emergent intervention was indicated. Post-arrest team 
recommended therapeutic hypothermia assuming BP and HR were 
stabilized. The patient was then taken to the cath lab to get a 
screw in pacer. In the cath lab he had a cardiac index around 2 
and a bedside ECHO showed an EF of approximately 30 percent.

On arrival to the CCU, the pt was found to be overbreathing the 
vent, but not responding to commands or stimuli. BPs remained in 
the ___ on max dose levophed/dopamine/epi drips, with HRs in 
the 120s. He was paralyzed with cisatricurium with improved vent 
mechanics. Post-arrest team reevaluated and recommended slow, 
cautious cooling as tolerated. 

Of note, the pt was diagnosed with e.coli bacteriuria on pre-op 
urine culture and prescribed ciprofloxacin 500mg BID. He had 
taken two tablets prior to his arrest. EKG ___ demonstrated QTc 
396. 

On review of systems, his family denies any prior history of 
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, 
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies recent fevers, 
chills or rigors. Denies exertional buttock or calf pain. ROS 
limited by pt intubated and paralyzed.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  ___ with hx of 3VD/severe AS, presented s/p 
cardiac arrest with ROSC after 30 minutes, admitted for 
post-arrest management. On arrival to CCU, pt was requiring max 
doses of epi/levo/dopa drips to maintain sbps ___. He was 
also started on insulin gtt and modified therapeutic hypothermia 
was attempted. He had a significant metabolic acidosis/lactic 
acidosis requiring bicarb gtt and pushes which he did not 
respond to. Overnight his pressor requirement increased and max 
doses of vaso/neo were also added, maintaining sbps in the ___. 
At this point a discussion was had with the pt's daughter and 
the decision was made to not escalate care, and not to do CPR. 
This morning, the pt reverted to a paced rhythm and his sbps 
dropped to the ___ by a-line without waveform. With the pt's 
daughter and wife in the room, the pacer was turned off and 
revealed no heartbeat. The pt was pronounced dead at 810am. The 
medical examiner waived the case. 

# s/p cardiac arrest: Pt with cardiac arrest, 15 minutes down 
with shockable rhythm without chest compressions, followed by 15 
minutes of CPR with ROSC. Unclear etiology of arrest. Likely 
arrhythmia ___ known cardiac disease. Possible exacerbated by 
fluoroquinolone usage. Pt with persistent hypotension requiring 
levophed/dopamine/epi gtts and unstable heart rate which delayed 
onset of cooling. 

# Respiratory Failure: pt intubated in the setting of cardiac 
arrested. paralyzed for overbreathing the vent. 

# Metabolic acidosis: Pt with pH 7.00, likely multifactorial due 
to ___, lactic acidosis in absence of respiratory compensation. 

# s/p CHB: pt with complete heart block after arrest. Screw in 
pacer placed in cath lab. 

# ___: Cr elevated, likely due to hypoperfusion during cardiac 
arrest. 

# Leukocytosis: likely ___ hypoperfusion during prolonged 
cardiac arrest. pt also with UTI, however normal wbc on 
admission, therefore wbc 20 probably associated with global 
injury rather than infection. 

# Elevated liver enzymes: Pt with transaminitis, and elevated 
LDH. Likely due to shock liver, with possible component of 
congestive hepatopathy. Less likely to be infection etiology. 

# UGIB: pt with dark blood from NG tube. Unclear etiology. No 
preceding e/o GI bleed. Possible stress gastritis. Likely 
exacerbated by coagulopathy. 
- pantoprazole IV BID

# CAD/3VD: 
- continue asa PR

Chief Complaint:
""People have been telling me that I have OCD and depression, I 
also think of suicide and I was told that I should take it 
seriously...""

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Pt is ___ with reported h/o OCD and depression, who presented to 
___ per the recommendation of his twin sister for recurrent 
intrusive thoughts about jumping off of a stairwell. He reports 
that these thoughts only occur when he is sitting on the upper 
floor in a ___ library, at which time thoughts will pop into 
his head of jumping head-first from the stairwell. He denies 
ever having any intent of actually go through with this. Of 
note, as pt described his history he was quite tangential, and 
difficult to follow. He frequently preferred to speak in 
metaphors, such as when he described his stressors as: ""this 
boat that is the US feels like it's sinking, and ___ is the 
cabin on top that I'm trying to get out of to help the boat from 
sinking, but they keep preventing me from getting out of it."" Pt 
initially reports that he is a graduate student at ___, 
studying for a degree in public administration. It is a ___ 
degree, however pt is now in his ___ year of trying to finish 
the requirements for it. He attributes this to not being able to 
get assignments turned in on time due to his OCD. He handed in a 
paper late last semester, and reports that he is now only a 
couple of credits short of graduating. If he completes a 6-week 
course he expects to graduate in ___. 

Re: his h/o OCD pt describes it in relation to writing papers 
for school. He feels that he has a vast amount of knowledge and 
has obsessive thoughts of always wanting to add more to the 
papers. Eventually he will go back and add the material, which 
helps to relieve his stress, but ends of delaying his completion 
of the work.

Pt describes his mood as ""dysthymic."" He says that he has always 
felt this way. Denies any h/o manic symptoms. On review of NVS, 
pt endorses some difficulty sleeping and excessive feelings of 
guilt that he is not living up to his expectations of his 
ancestors.
 
Past Medical History:
PMH: h/o ventricular tachycardia diagnosed at age ___, resolved 
with cardiac ablation. No current PCP; has a family doctor in 
___, ___ where he grew up.

Past Psych Hx: Prior dx of OCD and depression.
No prior hospitalizations. No h/o SA, SIB or assaultive 
behavior.
Has no current out-pt providers.
___ saw a therapist in ___ grade for depressed mood. Saw a 
psychiatrist and therapist for several months ___ years ago. Pt 
took Prozac for about 4 months with minimal improvement in mood 
and developed ""angry"" outbursts. Pt stopped seeing his therapist 
in ___ b/c he felt the therapist was accusing him of 
using her to get charge for overdue library books taken away. 
(Pt had 50-100 library books at his home that he was keeping to 
work on a school assignment. When discussing this, pt began by 
describing how the books were very neatly stacked up in his apt. 
When further ?'ed about why he never returned them, pt stated 
""there were so many of them... I guess I could have carried ___ 
back each day... that's the kind of thing I've had trouble 
getting done."")
 
Social History:
Pt was born and raised in ___, ___. His parents were never 
married and separated when pt was 2. His father lives in 
___, and pt is not close to him. Pt grew up with his mother, 
grandmother and and twin sister. Pt was particularly close to 
his grandmother. He describes his mother as loving and caring, 
but had to work hard and was not always available. Pt reports 
that his mother came from an upper-middle class family, however 
she got pregnant at a young age and spent her time fluctuating 
between working lower-level jobs and being on welfare. Pt 
identifies this as causing significant conflicts within the 
family. When asked about abuse, pt recalls an episode at age ___ 
at a hospital in which he had to be stuck 13+ times with a 
needle for blood draw... ""anytime I've been asked about abuse, I 
always think back to that... but I don't ever have memories of 
being sexually molested or things like that."" Pt did well in

patient arrived on the floor on IV fluids, and acetaminophen and 
oxycodone for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically 
stable.  There was some oozing noted during the OR case, so the

medication with continued good effect. Diet was progressively 
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability.

with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services.

well-managed with oral pain medication.  You are now ready to be 
discharged home.

to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.

might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M who was admitted to the General Surgical
Service on ___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal
pain. Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed acute appendicitis
without abscess or perforation. WBC was elevated at 13.6. The
patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the floor on IV fluids, and acetaminophen and
oxycodone for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically
stable. There was some oozing noted during the OR case, so the
decision was made to monitor the patient overnight and check a
CBC in the AM. POD #1 CBC was stable.
When tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain
medication with continued good effect. Diet was progressively
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability.
The patient voided without problem. During this hospitalization,
the patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with
respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively
participated in the plan of care. The patient received
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this
stay.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. The patient was discharged home without services.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to ___ with
acute appendicitis. You were taken to the operating room and
had your appendix removed laparoscopically. This procedure went
well. Your blood levels were checked and have remained stable.
You are now tolerating a regular diet and your pain is
well-managed with oral pain medication. You are now ready to be
discharged home.
Please note the following discharge instructions:
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the
appointment listed below.
ACTIVITY:

feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs.
o You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you
can resume tub baths or swimming.
HOW YOU MAY FEEL:
o You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your
throat during surgery.
o You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping.
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem
unappealing.
o All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go
away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon.
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks.
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"".
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your
pain gets too severe.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an ___ yo man with extensive cardiac history who now 
presents from ___ with diffuse rash.  Patient is a poor 
historian, and am unable to contact his sisters or outpatient 
providers at this time.
Per combination of patient history and review of presenting 
medical records, it appears as though patient had onset of rash, 
predominantly in lower extremities, a couple of weeks ago (at 
the end of ___.  The rash increased, coalesced into 
apparent purpuric lesions, and presented to ___ 
___ at that time (___).  Per reports, there was some 
history of recent Bactrim use (unclear when he was on this, for 
what reason).  It appears from limited discharge summary that he 
was kept overnight, had negative CXR, negative U/A.  He had ___, 
ANCA, complement levels drawn which were pending on discharge.  
He was seen by dermatology and rheumatology and per report had a 
derm biopsy done which was pending on time of discharge.  He was 
then d/ced to ___ with presumptive diagnosis of 
hypersensitivy reaction to bactrim versus vasculitis of unknown 
etiology. 
At ___ he was managed conservatively.  Bactrim was 
added to his allergy list, no steroids were started.  Unclear by 
notes if rash has since worsened or just not resolved since 
arrival at ___.  Labs were also drawn on day of 
admission and notable for new low WBC at 2.1.  Therefore sent to 
hospital for evaluation for etiology of rash, ?underlying 
malignancy (given low WBC) vs rheum d/o.
Also of note, per notes with him on arrival there is much 
mention of his end stage CHF, with significant weight loss over 
past 6 months, difficulties with managing CHF symptoms and 
maintaining forward flow (has had renal insufficiency, ?ischemic 
hepatitis).  Apparently hospice/palliative care has been 
broached with patient in the past, but he is having disconnect 
with his diagnosis and wishes to remain full code.  
In ED, patient was AVSS.  Labs notable only for slightly low WBC 
at 3.0.  Patient was admitted for further management.
Currently pt complains only of pain in his legs.  Denies f/c, 
nausea/vomiting, SOB, chest pain.  Does report weight loss as 
above.  Other ROS negative.

Skin, left knee; biopsy (A):

Upper dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with extensive

consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Comment. Case findings from initial tissue levels discussed with 
Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___. The results of additional 
levels will be reported in a separate addendum.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an ___ year old man with extensive cardiac history now 
presents with diffuse petechial/purpuric rash.
.
# Rash:  Visually appears as a hypersensitivity vasculitis, 
possibly from recent bactrim use.  His other medications were 
reviewed without finding other possible culprit medication.
He clinically appeared well aside from the rash, was non-toxic 
appearing, stable vitals signs, stable renal and liver function 
and other laboratory values.
ESR was measured at 40, CRP was measured at 31, C3 was measured 
at 100, and C4 was measured at 19.
Dermatology was consulted and performed a skin biopsy.  Their 
note is attached to below.  Final biopsy results were pending at 
discharge, but preliminary results were consistent with a 
hypersensitivity reaction (not convincing for vasculitis).  They 
recommended triamcinalone ointment 0.1% to affected areas daily, 
under occlusion (seran wrap) for one hour as well as colchicine 
0.6 mg po BID until seen in follow up next week.  A follow up 
appt needs to be arranged within one week.  The family was 
notified of how to make the appointment (as he was discharged on 
___ and the office was not available for appointments at the 
time of discharge).  
.
Dermatology consult note ___ by Drs. ___.
""Assessment/Plan:
___ with MMPs presents with 3 weeks of a progressive purpuric
rash that is clinically consistent with a leukocytoclastic
vasculitis (LCV). Differential diagnosis includes drug rash with
purpura ___ coumadin, but the eruption seems more florid than
this. Fortunately, his urinalysis was normal which goes against
renal involvement. Skin biopsy was performed for
clinico-pathologic correlation. Skin biopsy was performed for
clinico-pathologic correlation.
  Unfortunately, no etiology can be found for LCV in up to one
half of all cases. LCV can be associated with drugs, infection,
CTD and malignancy. The most common drugs that can cause
cutaneous vasculitis are antibiotics, particularly beta-lactam
drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and diuretics. 
 Various infections may be associated with vasculitis. Upper
respiratory tract infections, particularly with beta-hemolytic
streptococci, and viral hepatitis are implicated most often.
Perhaps this rash was preceded by an infection for which he was
given Bactrim?
  Malignancy accounts for less than 1% of cases of cutaneous
vasculitis. Perhaps lymphoproliferative diseases are more 
common.
Given his new leukopenia and his weight loss, a work up 
including
SPEP and UPEP seems warranted. 
  Given the progressive nature of the rash, the fact that it is
ulcerating and the fact that it is painful, I recommend the
following:
 - f/u RUSH bx results (they should be back tomorrow)
 - check SPEP, UPEP
 - apply Bactroban ointment BID to all open areas
 - triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID to rash, avoid open areas (wrap
legs with Kerlix after treatment)
 - if biopsy consistent with vasculitis would consider systemic
treatment. Given his CHF and the fact that he is on coumadin
would avoid prednisone. Colchicine is a good option.
 - cont to list Bactrim as allergy
** at time of discharge please talk with dermatology consult
resident to arrange outpt follow up**
 
--Please arrange for suture removal in ___ days.""

.
# Chronic systolic CHF:  No apparent active issues clinically.  
Continued outpatient dig, lisinopril, coumadin, metoprolol.  
Chest x-ray findings as below.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Continued dig, coumadin, metoprolol.  
His INR level was subtherapeutic, so his coumadin was increased 
from 2.5mg daily to 5mg daily.  He was discharged on this 
elevated dose with instructions to moniter his INR and adjust 
his coumadin as needed for goal INR of 2 to 3.
.
# Chest x-ray findings:  Noted left sided hiatal hernia versus 
pleural effusion.  Did not pursue as would not change management 
(given his history of extensive CHF, if it is a pleural 
effusion, is likely from this, and currently is not 
symptomatic).

common.
Given his new leukopenia and his weight loss, a work up
including
SPEP and UPEP seems warranted. Given the progressive nature of the rash, the fact that it is
ulcerating and the fact that it is painful, I recommend the
following:
- f/u RUSH bx results (they should be back tomorrow)
- check SPEP, UPEP
- apply Bactroban ointment BID to all open areas
- triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID to rash, avoid open areas (wrap
legs with Kerlix after treatment)
- if biopsy consistent with vasculitis would consider systemic
treatment. Given his CHF and the fact that he is on coumadin
would avoid prednisone. Colchicine is a good option.
- cont to list Bactrim as allergy
** at time of discharge please talk with dermatology consult

.
# Chronic systolic CHF: No apparent active issues clinically.
Continued outpatient dig, lisinopril, coumadin, metoprolol.
Chest x-ray findings as below.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Continued dig, coumadin, metoprolol.
His INR level was subtherapeutic, so his coumadin was increased
from 2.5mg daily to 5mg daily. He was discharged on this
elevated dose with instructions to moniter his INR and adjust
his coumadin as needed for goal INR of 2 to 3.
.
# Chest x-ray findings: Noted left sided hiatal hernia versus
pleural effusion. Did not pursue as would not change management
(given his history of extensive CHF, if it is a pleural
effusion, is likely from this, and currently is not
symptomatic).

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms ___ is an ___ w CAD and a-fib (formerly on 
warfarin and dofetilide), who presented originally to OSH w SOB, 
was transferred to ___ for cath for NSTEMI, course complicated 
by polymorphic VT.
.  
# CORONARIES: Pt w known CAD and prior stenting, now p/w NSTEMI 
at OSH, s/p cath at ___ with bare metal stent to R-PDA. Pt 
denies CP/SOB. On heparin drip for NSTEMI at first, then on 
heparin to coumadin bridge for a-fb. TTE shows reduced EF. On 
discharge, hemodynamically stable, on aspirin, clopidogrel, 
beta-blocker, valsartan and atorvastatin. 
.
# RHYTHM: History of afib, on coumadin and on dofetilide at 
home. Had frequent runs of polymorphic VT with no symptoms on 
floor, broke with isoproterenol gtt. Likely induced by 
dofetilide in setting of cardiac ischemia and reduced renal 
clearance (Cr 1.1, unclear baseline).  Now off dofetilide and 
isoproterenol, s/p run of afib with RVR after cath. Metoprolol 
used as rate control. Though bradycardia might increase the risk 
of ectopic ventricular arrhythmias, it is likely not the cause 
of the VT on this admission (VT caused by ischemia/dofetilide). 
For afib, pt rate-controlled w metoprolol and anticoagulated w 
warfarin w INR goal of ___. Therapeutic on discharge, regular 
followup recommended. Pt monitored on tele, electrolytes 
repleted as needed - K>4.0, Mg >2.0. 
.
# PUMP: Likely new diagnosis of systolic CHF, though unclear 
whether h/o chronic CHF, unknown EF. Pt does not appear 
overloaded on exam. Echo with EF 40-45% with mid to distal 
septal and inferior/lateral hypokinesis s/p cath. Beta blocker, 
___, furosemide 40mg po daily.
.  
# Breast cancer: with mets to pleura. On hormonal therapy; no 
chemo or xrt.  Per conversation with oncologist coverage, OK to 
not restart aromatase inhibitor (side effect of cardiac 
ischemia) as inpatient. Per Dr ___ aromatase on 
discharge. Followup w oncologist recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY/ASSESSMENT: Ms. ___ is a ___ female with 
the past medical history of myeloproliferative disorder, 
Afib/flutter, dementia who presents with SOB, found to have 
pneumonia and worsening leukocytosis. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE: 

# Acute on Chronic HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, due to 
# CAP, Atypical Pneumonia # COPD with acute exacerbation
Pt presented with 2 weeks of cough and was found to be hypoxic. 
CXR with right basilar opacity concerning for pneumonia. Sputum 
cx growing GPCs, GNRs, GPRs. Flu neg. Her respiratory viral 
sample was insufficient and could not be performed. However she 
has been improving on antibiotic therapy with overall 
improvement
in O2 requirement. Treated with levofloxacin x 5 d given PCN 
allergy. Was also on vancomycin; however, this was stopped given 
negative MRSA swab. Given persistent O2 requirement, pulm was 
consulted. CT suggestive of underlying COPD and likely explains
persistent O2 requirement in the setting of recent pulmonary 
infection. Ultimately decision made to treat with 5 days of 
azithromycin for suspected atypical pneumonia (ECG repeated and 
QTc improved to 440's). She will complete her course on ___. 
She was also discharged home with supplemental oxygen and will 
follow up with pulmonary in clinic with plan for PFTs and repeat 
imaging in the outpatient setting. 

#Orthostatic hypotension - persistent despite adequate fluid 
challenge (though overall improved since admission), minimal 
postural symptoms now so will not attempt to correct this, 
suspect chronic component to this though can't be sure.  

#Acute on chronic LEUKOCYTOSIS #Myelodysplastic Syndrome 
#Leukemoid Reaction: Given history of myeloproliferative 
disorder with worsening leukocytosis over last ___ months, 
initial concern for possible transformation to acute leukemia. 
Pt was evaluted by heme/onc and her peripheral blood smear was 
reviewed, which did not show immature WBCs on peripheral blood 
smear. Instead, smear was consistent with underlying MPN given 
increased number of mature appearing WBCs. Given this, 
leukocytosis most likely stress reaction to underlying illness 
(PNA, see below) in setting of chronic underlying MPN.
- f/u heme/onc recs, given stable leukocytosis over the 
remainder of her hospital course with interval resolution of 
bandemia, no further interventions were made in-house and she 
will follow up with hematology after discharge for further 
management and likely bone marrow biopsy. Given plans to be here 
___) until the end ___ she will need referral to our 
Heme department (her hematologist is in ___).  
- continued hydrea 500mg, increased from 3x/week to once daily 

# ANEMIA: Baseline Hgb ___, currently close to baseline. 
Macrocytosis likely related to hydrea. No evidence of hemolysis. 
Stable on discharge.

# AFIB/FLUTTER: As outpatient was on 15mg Xarelto as she had 
been on Plavix as well. Plavix was recently discontinued but 
Xarelto dose was not adjusted. Rivaroxaban dose has been 
increased here to 20 mg.
- continued rivaroxaban 20 mg daily
- continued amiodarone, back to home dose of 200mg daily
- of note, patient with bradycardia to ___ but hemodynamically 
stable (with exception of orthostatic hypotension as above). 
suspect chronic, will continue to monitor. 

CHRONIC/STABLE:
 
# DM2: Not on any home meds, diet controlled per husband. On 
___. FSBS ranged 130s-230s over the past 24 hours. Treated with 
Humalog sliding scale while in-house. 

# HLD: on home statin
# Osteoporosis: continued on home alendronate
# Dementia: continued donepezil

RESOLVED: 
# NAUSEA: Resolved.
- avoiding QTc prolonging agents given prolonged QTc
- cont tums PRN and ranitidine
- bowel regimen

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- lung nodules seen on CT scan will need follow up 
- patient has had interval progression of her MDS with worsening 
leukocytosis, she will need outpatient Bone Marrow Biopsy and 
will follow up with Hematology at ___ while in ___ for the summer
- Outpatient Pulmonary follow up has also been arranged with 
plan to pursue outpatient PFTs and repeat imaging with continued 
wean off supplemental oxygen over the next few weeks

Ms. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total 
time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and 
coordination of care today was greater than 30 minutes.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with a cough. You were found to have 
a pneumonia. You were also started on an antibiotic and your 
pneumonia slowly improved. You will have 2 more days of daily 
antibiotic (Azithromycin or Zithromax) after you leave the 
hospital to complete your course. because of your underlying 
Emphysema (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease), your lungs are 
taking longer to recover fully from the pneumonia. For this 
reason, You are being sent home on oxygen as well as continued 
nebulizer treatments. We have also arranged for you to be seen 
in the Lung/Pulmonology clinic after discharge. 

You also had very high white blood cell counts and were seen by 
our blood doctors who ___ your blood tests and recommended 
outpatient follow up for bone marrow biopsy. We are concerned 
that your recent increase in blood counts is a sign of 
progression of your chronic blood condition (called 
Myelodysplastic Syndrome). In the meantime we have increased 
your hydroxyurea (Hydrea) from 3 times a week to daily to help 
control your blood counts.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with a cough. You were found to have
a pneumonia. You were also started on an antibiotic and your
pneumonia slowly improved. You will have 2 more days of daily
antibiotic (Azithromycin or Zithromax) after you leave the
hospital to complete your course. because of your underlying
Emphysema (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease), your lungs are
taking longer to recover fully from the pneumonia. For this
reason, You are being sent home on oxygen as well as continued
nebulizer treatments. We have also arranged for you to be seen
in the Lung/Pulmonology clinic after discharge.
You also had very high white blood cell counts and were seen by
our blood doctors who ___ your blood tests and recommended
outpatient follow up for bone marrow biopsy. We are concerned
that your recent increase in blood counts is a sign of
progression of your chronic blood condition (called
Myelodysplastic Syndrome). In the meantime we have increased
your hydroxyurea (Hydrea) from 3 times a week to daily to help
control your blood counts.

of asthma, HFpEF, 2+ MR, and ILD (UIP/NSIP) currently on MMF,
azathioprine, prednisone and 3L of oxygen at home, afib on
apixiban, prior CVA who presents with 10 days of cough,
difficulty breathing, and progressive mobility-limiting
weakness/fatigue s/p 4 days of azithromycin treatment started on
___. 

Patient has long-standing ILD and uses O2 at home. 10 days ago,
he began to feel increasingly unwell, developed a cough
productive of sputum, and felt that he had increased WOB,
requiring him to use his home O2 more often. For the last 
several
days, his O2 sat has dropped to the mid 80's with walking, which
is unusual for him. 4 days ago (___), he saw his CHA
pulmonologist who prescribed azithromycin. 

Within the last 48 hours, he developed such severe weakness and
difficulty breathing that he could not stand independently. His
wife also reports that he had a fever (temperature unknown) with
shaking chills last night (___), resolved with 2 tylenol. For
the last two days, his sputum has been brown/black with some
epistaxis upon blowing his nose. His wife also noted 2 large
abdominal ecchymoses one day ago but the patient is unaware of
how or when they first occurred. The patient and family report
that he has intermittently had easy bruising initially 
attributed
to his chronic prednisone, but this seems to have worsened in 
the
past several months since he started MMF.

Denies sick contacts, pain on inspiration. Endorses occasional
chest pain with cough, but no other chest pain, nausea.
Subjective fever last night, but has not taken temperature in 
the
last 10 days while sick. Due to worsening condition, referred to
ED by his pulmonologist for CT of chest and admit to medicine w/
pulm consult.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
==================
The patient is a ___ man with history of HFpEF, severe 
MR, IOD (UIP/NSI P), A. fib on apixaban, prior CVA on 3 L of 
home oxygen presenting with 10 days of worsening dyspnea, cough, 
and increasing O2 requirement with accompanying fatigue and 
weakness.  He had pulmonary edema secondary to hypervolemia and 
was diuresed with IV Lasix with significant improvement in 
oxygen requirement.  On transition to po diuretics, oxygen 
requirement once again increased.  Repeat CT scan showed some 
worsening ground glass opacities concerning for infection versus 
ILD flare, so patient was initiated on broad-spectrum 
antibiotics as well as IV methylprednisolone.  Due to increasing 
oxygen requirement not improving with diuresis he was 
transferred to the ICU. While in the ICU he was diuresed 
extensively, continued on steroids and treated for HAP. Invasive 
cardiac testing showed no CAD and pulmonary pressures consistent 
with euvolemia. He had worsening renal failure, MSOF and hence, 
family made decision to make patient CMO on ___.

#Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Acute on chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
#Acute flare of chronic interstitial lung disease
#Mitral regurgitation
#Concern for pneumonia
On admission, it was determined the patient was likely suffering 
from pulmonary edema due to hypervolemia.  He was diuresed with 
IV Lasix with significant improvement in his symptoms as well as 
oxygen requirement to below baseline (0.5-1 L, ambulating 
without symptoms).  He had a small ___ bump as well as 
contraction alkalosis, so he was switched to oral diuretic with 
torsemide.  There his oxygen requirement started to worsen, and 
he was placed back on IV diuresis with Lasix as well as 
initiating vancomycin and cefepime due to worsening groundglass 
opacities seen on repeat CT scan.  CTA ruled out pulmonary 
embolus.  Given the CT findings he was also started on IV 
steroids for possible ILD flare.  On ___, he had worsening 
oxygen requirements not improving with diuresis, likely 
secondary to flash pulmonary edema from his mitral 
regurgitation.  He was transferred to the ICU for higher oxygen 
supply and close monitoring. While in the MICU he was diuresed, 
continued on steroids and treated for HAP. Given no improvement 
he was taken for invasive cardiac testing that showed no CAD and 
pulmonary pressures consistent with euvolemia. He was electively 
intubated for invasive cardiac testing but overall condition 
worsened with acute renal failure, liver failure and MSOF. He 
was made CMO on ___ after family meeting.

DEATH NOTE
==========
Paged by the patient's nurse at approximately 1200 that the 
patient had expired. He had been transitioned to comfort 
measures at approximately 1115 this morning. On exam, the 
patient demonstrated fixed and dilated pupils, absent heart and 
lung
sounds, and no withdrawal from painful stimuli. Time of death 
was called at 1208. Attending of record and patient's PCP were 
notified. Family was notified and requested autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o gentleman without any significant 
medical history who presented to the ED from his PCP's office 
for a Hgb of 6.

He was in his normal state of health until five months ago when 
he started to feel as if his 'stomach was bubbling'.  He 
attributed the sensation to excessive caffeine use, as he was 
drinking several soft and energy drinks every day.  As a result, 
he stopped drinking caffeine and experienced severe caffeine 
withdrawal headaches.  To self-treat his withdrawal headaches he 
was taking approximately 9 regular aspirin a day for about a 
week, and then continued to take numerous aspirin after that 
weeks.  

In the setting of his excessive aspirin intake, he began to 
notice dark tarry stools and increasing fatigue.  He appoximates 
that he's had about one melanic stool per day, although in the 
past few days it has been more frequent.  No other symptoms of 
diarrhea or bright red blood in his stool.  He had a couple 
episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody vomiting approximately two 
weeks ago. 

As the month progressed, he noted increasing fatigue, especially 
as his job as the ___ ___ requires a great deal of 
energy.  He notes increasing muscle weakness, a heart that 'was 
working hard' and the sensation of 'seeing bright lights' with 
exertion.  A few weeks ago, he had a episode of left arm and 
chest pain that resolved over the day, was not associated with 
exertion, and changed with movement, which the patient 
attributed to an uncomfortable sleeping position.  He also noted 
that his skin appeared more pale. 

 He initially attributed his symptoms to dehydration and thus, 
drank a great deal of gatorade and water to compensate.  When 
this did not relieve his symptoms, he visited his PCP.  Labs 
done by his primary care physician ___ ___ were notable for 
severe ___ deficiency anemia with Hg 6.0, Hct 19.9, MCV 68.3, 
Plt 446, Serum Fe 27, TIBC 479, Tfn ___ 5.6 and Transferrin 342. 
 Due to his severe anemia and suggestive symptoms, his PCP 
suggested he present to the ___ ED.  At the advice of his PCP, 
he presented to the ___ ED.

He does not report any fevers, chills, dyspnea, pain, chemical 
exposures, travel history or trauma.  

In the ED, initial vitals:  98.8 98 131/58 16 100% RA.  He had 
guiaic positive stools and GI was consulted.  They suggested an 
EGD tomorrow morning, and starting a PPI tonight.  

Vitals prior to transfer: 98.1 79 93/61 18 100%RA
 
Currently, he feels slightly fatigued, but has no other 
symptoms, including no pain, no dizziness, no lightheadedness 
and no palpitations.  He is comfortable laying in bed.
 
ROS:  
No fevers, chills, night sweats.  Has gained 3 lbs over the last 
month. 
No changes in hearing, no changes in balance. 
No cough, no shortness of breath. 
No chest pain. 
No dysuria or hematuria. 
No numbness or weakness, no focal deficits.

2.  Multiple abnormal appearing segments of small bowel are 
identified, some with apparent wall thickening and other with

processes such as Crohn disease. Assessment is limited given the 
static nature of CT enterography, and as the majority of enteric 
contrast was in the colon.  MR-Enterography is recommended for 
further evaluation. 

PATHOLOGY
-Upper GI biopsy pending at time of discharge

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o gentleman with approximately one 
month of melenic stools, excessive aspirin use and labs 
suggestive of ___ deficiency anemia suggestive for upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Anemia:  He presented with lab values consistent with ___ 
deficiency anemia with Hgb of 5.1, melena history consistent 
with upper gastroinstestinal bleed.  He received 3U PRBC which 
stabilized his Hgb at 8.  GI was consulted and preformed a EGD, 
which showed no source of bleeding, but did show mild gastritis. 
 He was started on po pantoprazole. He also received a CT scan 
to evaluate for possible source of bleed in small intestine (eg, 
small intestinal lymphoma given h/o night sweats), which showed 
some changes which might be consistent with inflammatory process 
such as Crohn's disease, but no masses. H. Pylori serology and 
hemolysis labs were negative.  At the time of discharge, he was 
hemodynamically stable with a Hgb/Hct of 8.7/28.7.  He was 
recommended by GI to have an outpatient colonoscopy.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Will need CBC rechecked at appointment with PCP to ensure 
stability
- Will need outpatient colonoscopy, and given evidence of 
changes possibly consistent with Crohn's on CT enterography, 
will need referral to GI (in Atrius system)
- Pathology from biopsy from EGD pending at time of discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to take part in your care during your stay at 
the ___.  As you know, you were 
admitted to the hospital to receive a blood transfusion and 
investigate the cause of your anemia (low blood counts).  You 
received a Esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD in which a camera 
took pictures of your esophagus, stomach and the upper part of 
your small intestine.  There was no site of bleeding identified 
during the EGD.  

You also received a CT scan to look for changes in your 
intestine that might be bleeding and could also result in a low 
blood count.  The results of this test were pending at the time 
of discharge. 

We have made you an appointment with your primary doctor who you 
should ___ with so that he can help get you scheduled for 
an outpatient colonoscopy.  You may also need a capsule study 
(which looks at your small intestine), but only if the other 
tests are negative.

We wish you good health in the future.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old female with history of IVDU (clean since 
___ on maintenance methadone) who was found down on ___ in 
a pool ov emesis with ___ bottles of 
acetaminophen/diphenhydramine as well as with empty wine and 
vodka bottles.  She was discovered after she failed to show up 
for a mental health provider appointment and the police were 
called to check on her.  She was intubated in the field then 
taken to OSH where ___ Coma scale of 3. Tox screen neg for 
everything but APAP (initial APAP level was 497) & methadone. 
Initial ABG showed metabolic acidosis (pH=7.12). LFT's: AST=400 
ALT=200, normal bili, INR normal. Head CT neg. QTc of .7 so Mg 
given. She received oral NAC load.  After several hours at OSH 
pt's MS improved so she sat up and tried to remove ET tube and 
thus was extubated and able to follow commands.  
.  
She was transferred here and admitted to the SICU overnight 
given acidosis and concern she would need liver transplant.  
Major active issues have been persistent confusion, which 
improved as of this morning, as well as opiate withdrawal and 
pain prior to having her methadone restarted today.  She has 
continued on NAC.  Other major issue has been acute kidney 
injury and rhabdomyolysis likely due to her time down for which 
she has received fluids with bicarbonate.  As her LFT's are 
trending down and her encephalopathy has dramatically resolved 
she is transferred  to the medical floor for further evaluation 
and treatment.  
.
Currently, she endorses some soreness of her back and shoulders 
and sore throat as well as diffuse abdominal pain.  She denies 
nausea/vomiting.  She denies fevers, chills, or confusion at 
this time.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. with acetaminophen/diphenhydramine overdose from a 
suicide attempt found down and was admitted to the hospital with 
rhabdomyolysis and acute hepatitis.  
  
1) Acetaminophen overdose: The patient was started on 
N-acetylcysteine, and her LFTs initially remained stable.  
However, on Day 3 of hospitalization, the patient's LFTs 
markedly increased with ALT peaking in the 9000s and AST in the 
8000s.  The patient's liver synthetic dysfunction also was 
impacted with her INR increasing to a peak of 4.2.  The patient 
responded to NAC therapy and IVF and by the time of discharge 
her LFTs had been downtrending significantly.  Her INR was 1.7 
on ___ (Day 7 of hospitalization) and her NAC was 
discontinued.  

2) Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury: The patient developed 
acute kidney injury with creatinine elevating to a peak of 2.5.  
The patient was placed on IV fluids and by the time of 
discharge, her creatinine had improved to baseline at 0.7.  Her 
CK peaked at 9667 but was in the 100s at discharge.

3) Suicide attempt: The patient's attempt was determined to be a 
serious attempt with low chance of rescue and premeditation.  
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that she was a danger 
to herself and a ___ form was initiated.  She was kept 
under 24 hour 1:1 monitoring.

4) Urinary tract infection: The patient developed a fever on Day 
5 of her admission and was found to have a urinary tract 
infection by E-coli.  The patient was started on ciprofloxacin 
for a ___) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 45 to 24.6 in 
the setting of large volume IV fluids. The patient endorsed 
having a bowel movement with blood; this was evaluated by 
flexible sigmoidoscopy, and the patient was noted to have 
hemorrhoids. A repeat hematocrit was performed on the same day 
of the bowel movement which contained blood, and showed a stable 
hematocrit at the time of discharge. Iron studies did not show 
an iron deficiency anemia, and a reticulocyte index was low; it 
was thought that the damage sustained to the kidneys may have 
temporarily decreased the amount of Erythropoietin produced, but 
that with further kidney recovery, the hematocrit would also 
improve.

6) Respiratory distress: The patient developed mild pulmonary 
edema and tachypnea during her hospitalization secondary to IV 
fluids for her acute kidney injury.  This had resolved by the 
time of discharge with the aid of PO Furosemide.

7) History of hepatitis C: Patient's viral load on this 
admission zero, therefore she had cleared her hep C.

8) Substance abuse: The patient came in on 75mg methadone daily 
for history of IVDU; this was decreased to 45mg in the setting 
of liver failure, but had been returned to her home dose by time 
of discharge.

9) Code: Full
 
Medications on Admission:
methadone 75 mg daily

 
Discharge Medications:
1. methadone 10 mg Tablet Sig: 7.5 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily).  
2. ondansetron 4 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you overdosed on 
benadryl and tylenol.  This caused massive liver injury and you 
were given the antidote to tylenol.  With treatment, your liver 
slowly improved.  Your kidneys also were damaged at the same 
time, but this resolved as well.  You also had a urinary tract 
infection which were treated with antibiotics.

You were seen by our psychiatrists who were concerned about this 
being a suicide attempt.  You are being discharged to a 
psychiatric facility to help manage your depression.

You have had the following changes to your medication:
START zofran - 4mg every 8 hours as needed for nausea
START prochlopherazine 10mg every 8 hours as needed for nausea
START omeprazole 40mg daily

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old female with history of IVDU (clean since
___ on maintenance methadone) who was found down on ___ in
a pool ov emesis with ___ bottles of
acetaminophen/diphenhydramine as well as with empty wine and
vodka bottles. She was discovered after she failed to show up
for a mental health provider appointment and the police were
called to check on her. She was intubated in the field then
taken to OSH where ___ Coma scale of 3. Tox screen neg for
everything but APAP (initial APAP level was 497) & methadone.
Initial ABG showed metabolic acidosis (pH=7.12). LFT's: AST=400
ALT=200, normal bili, INR normal. Head CT neg. QTc of .7 so Mg
given. She received oral NAC load. After several hours at OSH
pt's MS improved so she sat up and tried to remove ET tube and
thus was extubated and able to follow commands.
.
She was transferred here and admitted to the SICU overnight
given acidosis and concern she would need liver transplant.
Major active issues have been persistent confusion, which
improved as of this morning, as well as opiate withdrawal and
pain prior to having her methadone restarted today. She has
continued on NAC. Other major issue has been acute kidney
injury and rhabdomyolysis likely due to her time down for which
she has received fluids with bicarbonate. As her LFT's are
trending down and her encephalopathy has dramatically resolved
she is transferred to the medical floor for further evaluation
and treatment.
.
Currently, she endorses some soreness of her back and shoulders
and sore throat as well as diffuse abdominal pain. She denies
nausea/vomiting. She denies fevers, chills, or confusion at
this time.

admission he did develop urinary hesitancy. He had urine and 
blood cultures drawn. The Urine culture was positive for E Coli 
with pansensitivitiy (in the Atrius records; urine culture 
pending at ___. His blood cultures have had no growth to date 
for 48 hours at the time of discharge. He had a TTE which did 
not show any valvular vegetations. He did not have signs of an 
oral infection on exam. A prostate exam was performed given 
history of prostatitis and persistent symptoms of hesitancy, and 
was nontender, nonboggy. He was treated for an E. Coli urinary 
tract infection with ceftriaxone, and switched to ciprofloxacin 
500mg BID on discharge, with plan of total 7 days, ending ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Dr. ___, 

___ was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. 

Why you were here:

- You received Ceftriaxone in house, and we switched you to 
ciprofloxacin on discharge. 
- We repeated a prostate exam which did not show any tenderness. 


What to do when you go home: 
- We think you most likely have a urinary tract infection 
without prostatitis; however, if you finish your antibiotic 
course and have persistent symptoms you should be seen by a 
urologist for further evaluation. 
- We have made appointments for you with your primary care and 
with your urologist, as below. 
- You may resume your medications as you were taking them 
previously. 
- The last day of your ciprofloxacin course is ___.

IMAGING:
CXR: Cardiomegaly and findings suggesting mild pulmonary 
vascular 
hypertension; otherwise unremarkable. 

STRESS: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. 
Nuclear 
report sent separately. 

PERFUSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left 
ventricular size 
and function with preserved LVEF of 59%. 

ECHO: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus. Left 
ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be excluded. Probable diastolic 
dysfunction. The right ventricle is not well seen but appears 
dilated with mild hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate elevation of 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with diastolic CHF, HTN, DLP, h/o CVA/TIA, DM, COPD, and 
morbid obesity presenting with lightheadedness and jaw pain and 
new onset atrial fibrillation.  
  
ACUTE ISSUES:
# Arm/Jaw Pain: History was concerning for unstable angina so 
patient was started on heparin gtt the evening of admission 
while ruled out for ACS. Troponins neg x 3. EKG showed new onset 
afib but no evidence of ischemia compared to priors. Nuclear 
stress showed normal cardiac perfusion, no ischemic EKG changes, 
and no anginal symptoms.  TTE was suboptimal due to body habitus 
but was significant for probable diastolic dysfunction, RV 
dilation with mild hypokinesis, moderate TR, and moderate 
pulmonary HTN.  Unsure what cause of patient's jaw pain is, but 
it does not appear to be cardiac in nature. However, the RV 
dilatation and pulm HTN are suggestive of possible sleep apnea, 
so the attending recommended sleep study as an outpatient for 
further evaluation.  
  
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was found to be in new onset 
atrial fibrillation. She was asymptomatic at the time of 
admission but reports history of lightheadedness on minimal 
exertion which may be related to afib with RVR.  She was placed 
on a heparin gtt given her CHADS2 score of ___.  TTE and stress 
test results as above.  TSH within normal limits. No evidence of 
infection. patient was started on metoprolol for rate control 
and it was titrated up to metoprolol succinate 75mg po daily at 
the time of discharge. She was started on coumadin and bridged 
with lovenox 1mg/kg BID due to her high chads2 score and heparin 
drip was stopped prior to this.  Her aggrenox was stopped and 
she was continued on baby aspirin only. She will continue 
anticoagulation with plan for possible DC cardioversion in ___ 
weeks.
  
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Diastolic CHF: The patient appeared to be near euvolemia 
throughout admission. continued her on home lasix 20 mg daily  
# Diabetes: Held Metformin and Glimepiride while in house and 
used SSI. restarted home meds on discharge.
# Hypertension: continued home Losartan  
# Dyslipidemia: Converted home Pravastatin statin to high dose 
Atorvastatin 80 mg daily while in house during ___.  Switched 
pt back to home pravastatin on discharge.
# Osteoporosis: Continued Vitamin D/Calcium per home regimen.
# GERD: Continued home Omeprazole, Ranitidine
# COPD: No evidence of acute exacerbation. Continued home 
Albuterol, Fluticasone inhalers
# Depression: Continued home Citalopram 30 mg daily.  
  
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. Please consider sleep study to rule out sleep apnea (pt has 
dilated right ventricle on echo and pulmonary hypertension).
2. INR check on ___ and titrate warfarin as needed.
3. Stop lovenox once warfarin therapeutic.
4. Consider cardioversion for afib after ___ weeks of 
anticoagulation.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital because you were having light 
headedness and shortness of breath.  You also were having 
intermittant jaw pain.  You were found to have an irregular 
heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  You were started on a 
medication to help slow down your heart (Metoprolol) and you 
will need to continue to take this.  Patients with atrial 
fibrillation have a higher risk of developing a stroke.  You 
were started on a new blood thinner called Warfarin to decrease 
the risk of having a stroke.  You will need to also take the 
injection blood thinner (Enoxaparin AKA ""Lovenox"") for a few 
days until the warfarin levels are right.  You were taught how 
to give yourself these injections.

In addition, you had a stress test to see if your jaw pain was 
from angina (decreased blood flow to the heart).  Your stress 
test did not show any evidence of this, so we think your jaw 
pain was not from your heart.

We have made a few other changes to your medications:
**Stop Aggrenox (Dipyridamole)
**Begin taking a baby aspirin 81 mg daily
** Start Warfarin 5 mg a day (this may need to be adjusted based 
on the level in your blood)
** Start Enoxaparin (Lovenox) injections until your INR level is 
between ___
** Start Metoprolol XL 75 mg once a day

Please continue to take the rest of your medications as 
prescribed
Please follow up with your primary care doctor and your 
cardiologist (see appointments below).

You will need to have your blood drawn by your home nurse ___ 
level). Please have the results faxed to your primary care 
doctor ___ number ___.

IMAGING:
CXR: Cardiomegaly and findings suggesting mild pulmonary
vascular
hypertension; otherwise unremarkable.
STRESS: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.
PERFUSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left
ventricular size
and function with preserved LVEF of 59%.
ECHO: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus. Left
ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be excluded. Probable diastolic
dysfunction. The right ventricle is not well seen but appears
dilated with mild hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate elevation of
pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with diastolic CHF, HTN, DLP, h/o CVA/TIA, DM, COPD, and
morbid obesity presenting with lightheadedness and jaw pain and
new onset atrial fibrillation.
ACUTE ISSUES:
# Arm/Jaw Pain: History was concerning for unstable angina so
patient was started on heparin gtt the evening of admission
while ruled out for ACS. Troponins neg x 3. EKG showed new onset
afib but no evidence of ischemia compared to priors. Nuclear
stress showed normal cardiac perfusion, no ischemic EKG changes,
and no anginal symptoms. TTE was suboptimal due to body habitus
but was significant for probable diastolic dysfunction, RV
dilation with mild hypokinesis, moderate TR, and moderate
pulmonary HTN. Unsure what cause of patient's jaw pain is, but
it does not appear to be cardiac in nature. However, the RV
dilatation and pulm HTN are suggestive of possible sleep apnea,
so the attending recommended sleep study as an outpatient for
further evaluation.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was found to be in new onset
atrial fibrillation. She was asymptomatic at the time of
admission but reports history of lightheadedness on minimal
exertion which may be related to afib with RVR. She was placed
on a heparin gtt given her CHADS2 score of ___. TTE and stress
test results as above. TSH within normal limits. No evidence of
infection. patient was started on metoprolol for rate control
and it was titrated up to metoprolol succinate 75mg po daily at
the time of discharge. She was started on coumadin and bridged
with lovenox 1mg/kg BID due to her high chads2 score and heparin
drip was stopped prior to this. Her aggrenox was stopped and
she was continued on baby aspirin only. She will continue
anticoagulation with plan for possible DC cardioversion in ___
weeks.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Diastolic CHF: The patient appeared to be near euvolemia
throughout admission. continued her on home lasix 20 mg daily
# Diabetes: Held Metformin and Glimepiride while in house and
used SSI. restarted home meds on discharge.
# Hypertension: continued home Losartan
# Dyslipidemia: Converted home Pravastatin statin to high dose
Atorvastatin 80 mg daily while in house during ___. Switched
pt back to home pravastatin on discharge.
# Osteoporosis: Continued Vitamin D/Calcium per home regimen.
# GERD: Continued home Omeprazole, Ranitidine
# COPD: No evidence of acute exacerbation. Continued home
Albuterol, Fluticasone inhalers
# Depression: Continued home Citalopram 30 mg daily.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. Please consider sleep study to rule out sleep apnea (pt has
dilated right ventricle on echo and pulmonary hypertension).
2. INR check on ___ and titrate warfarin as needed.
3. Stop lovenox once warfarin therapeutic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital with bradycardia and was 
evaluated by electrophysiology and decision was made to place 
ICD/pacer due to heart failure.  On ___ he was taken to the 
cardiac lab for placement and generator was placed however they 
were unable to advance leads. See procedure note for further 
details.  He was then referred to cardiac surgery for epicardial 
lead placement.  He underwent preoperative workup and continued 
to be treated with lasix for volume overloaded and beta blockers 
continued to be held due to slow ventricular rhythm.  On ___ he 
was brought to the operating room for epicardial lead placement 
via throacotomy.  See operative report for further details.  He 
was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative 
management.  That evening he was weaned from sedation, awoke 
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications. 
On post operative day one he had decreased urine output with 
increased creatinine and was started on dopamine with improved 
output however creatinine continued to climb with peak 3.2, 
acute kidney injury, but then progressively decreased.  He was 
started on coumadin for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. 
 He remained in the intensive care unit on dopamine.  On post 
operative day 5 he was weaned off the dopamine, creatinine 
continued to improve and he was transferred to the floor.  
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  He 
continued to progress and was ready for discharge home with 
services on ___ with creatinine back down to 1.8 and plan for 
INR check ___ with further dosing by primary care.  Additionally 
due to blood pressure he was unable to be started on carvedilol 
and valsartan.  His diuretic was stopped due to fluid balance 
negative and no evidence of overload.  Discussed with Dr 
___ to re evaluate as outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital with bradycardia and was
evaluated by electrophysiology and decision was made to place
ICD/pacer due to heart failure. On ___ he was taken to the
cardiac lab for placement and generator was placed however they
were unable to advance leads. See procedure note for further
details. He was then referred to cardiac surgery for epicardial
lead placement. He underwent preoperative workup and continued
to be treated with lasix for volume overloaded and beta blockers
continued to be held due to slow ventricular rhythm. On ___ he
was brought to the operating room for epicardial lead placement
via throacotomy. See operative report for further details. He
was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative
management. That evening he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
On post operative day one he had decreased urine output with
increased creatinine and was started on dopamine with improved
output however creatinine continued to climb with peak 3.2,
acute kidney injury, but then progressively decreased. He was
started on coumadin for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. He remained in the intensive care unit on dopamine. On post
operative day 5 he was weaned off the dopamine, creatinine
continued to improve and he was transferred to the floor.
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility. He
continued to progress and was ready for discharge home with
services on ___ with creatinine back down to 1.8 and plan for
INR check ___ with further dosing by primary care. Additionally
due to blood pressure he was unable to be started on carvedilol
and valsartan. His diuretic was stopped due to fluid balance
negative and no evidence of overload. Discussed with Dr
___ to re evaluate as outpatient.

      NONREACTIVE. 
      Reference Range: Non-Reactive. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old ___ woman, currently  
homeless, unemployed, reported history of schizophrenia, cocaine 
use disorder, alcohol use disorder, s/p numerous prior  
psychiatric hospitalizations and reported suicide attempt via  
cutting wrists, who presented to ___ reporting worsening 
depression and suicidal ideation with plan to overdose on  
medications.
. 
History obtained from the patient, who was a somewhat unreliable 
historian, significant for ongoing depression with auditory 
hallucinations of voices telling her to kill herself in the 
setting of medication noncompliance, significant alcohol and 
cocaine use, and homelessness. Patient also reporting poor 
sleep, poor appetite, anhedonia, feelings of homelessness. 
Mental status examination during beginning of hospitalization 
notable for a irritable woman with reactive affect, ""depressed"" 
mood, labile mood, suicidal ideation that intensified when 
discussing discharge options, reported auditory hallucinations 
although she did not appear to be responding to internal 
stimuli. 
. 
Diagnostically, etiology of presentation is likely 
multifactorial with significant substance use, possibly 
underlying neurocognitive deficits in the setting of years of 
substance abuse and numerous vascular risk factors, and perhaps 
underlying primary psychotic disorder all contributing. In 
addition, I cannot rule out underlying character pathology 
contributing to her presentation with chronic maladaptive coping 
mechanisms. 

#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted on a ___, upon 
admission, she refused to sign a CV. However, on ___, patient 
signed a CV, which was accepted. She maintained her safety 
throughout her psychiatric hospitalization on 15 minute checks. 
Although irritable at times with staff, she maintained adequate 
behavioral control and did not require physical or chemical 
restraints. 

#. Unspecified Psychotic Disorder: likely multifactorial in 
etiology as noted above
- ___ workup including lipid panel, TSH, HbA1c, B12, folate, 
RPR, and LFTs were all within normal limits. 
- Patient was encouraged to attend groups, but declined to 
attend throughout her hospitalization. 
- Although patient's did complain of some depressive symptoms, 
there seemed to be limited benefit of Zoloft and so this 
medication was not restarted in favor of targeting mood symptoms 
including irritability with a second generation antipsychotic. 
- After discussion of the risks and benefits, patient was 
initially started on Risperidone titrated to 2 mg po bid in 
addition to 1 mg po q4h prn agitation. Patient did not believe 
this medication was effective and expressed concern regarding 
the metabolic side effects of risperidone. 
- After discussion of the risks and benefits, we started Geodon 
60 mg po bid. She tolerated this medication well without side 
effects. Her mood improved during her hospitalization; her 
depression improved; her voices were lessened. She did endorse 
conditional suicidality initially when discussing discharge 
several days prior. However, after learning she could live with 
her daughter following discharge, her suicidality improved 
significantly as did her mood. At time of discharge she had been 
consistently denying suicidal ideation or thoughts of self harm 
with thought process that was notably linear, goal and future 
oriented. She was notably less irritable with her treatment team
- For complaints of insomnia, we restarted Trazodone 100 mg po 
qhs for insomnia which she tolerated well with no complaints of 
side effects 
- Of note, collateral was obtained from her outpatient treaters, 
who agreed with our above assessment and plan for patient to 
follow up with them following discharge. 
- In addition, prior medical records from hospitalizations at 
___ in ___ was obtained that revealed history and 
presentation similar to above with patient complaining of 
suicidal ideation in the setting of homelessness and cocaine 
use. 
- Patient declined to allow us to have a family meeting prior to 
discharge. However, she was amenable to referral to a ___ 
worker, who will continue to work with the patient as per 
discharge worksheet. 
.
#. Polysubstance Use Disorder: 
- Patient was encouraged to attend AA/NA during her 
hospitalization, which she mostly declined. 
- Discussed the risks and benefits of avoiding alcohol and 
illicit drug use and at time of discharge she did show some 
interest in maintaining her sobriety-- she did call numerous 
substance abuse programs, but was unable to find a match prior 
to discharge. Patient expressed interest in following up with 
her psychiatric providers regarding her substance use. 

#. Hypertension: ___ has a history of hypertension and has 
never before been on medications. During her stay, we began 
lisinopril 10 mg QD, which she tolerated well. Her blood 
pressures were labile but were maintained in the 
120s-150s/60-90s on lisinopril. She will follow up with her PCP 
for continued management.  

#. Eczema: While ___ was inpatient, her eczema flared behind 
her knees and in her elbow creases. We provided her with 
diphenhydramine 50mg BID as needed, hydrocortisone ointment BID, 
and Vaseline for moisturization. 

#. Muscle Spasm: On ___, ___ woke up with back and left 
shoulder pain after sleeping improperly on her arm. She had no 
concerning symptoms (weakness, decreased sensation) and had full 
range of motion on her left arm and shoulder. We encouraged 
stretching, heat packs, and ibuprofen as management of this 
presumed muscle spasm. She improved over several days.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old ___ woman, currently
homeless, unemployed, reported history of schizophrenia, cocaine
use disorder, alcohol use disorder, s/p numerous prior
psychiatric hospitalizations and reported suicide attempt via
cutting wrists, who presented to ___ reporting worsening
depression and suicidal ideation with plan to overdose on
medications.
.
History obtained from the patient, who was a somewhat unreliable
historian, significant for ongoing depression with auditory
hallucinations of voices telling her to kill herself in the
setting of medication noncompliance, significant alcohol and
cocaine use, and homelessness. Patient also reporting poor
sleep, poor appetite, anhedonia, feelings of homelessness.
Mental status examination during beginning of hospitalization
notable for a irritable woman with reactive affect, ""depressed""
mood, labile mood, suicidal ideation that intensified when
discussing discharge options, reported auditory hallucinations
although she did not appear to be responding to internal
stimuli.
.
Diagnostically, etiology of presentation is likely
multifactorial with significant substance use, possibly
underlying neurocognitive deficits in the setting of years of
substance abuse and numerous vascular risk factors, and perhaps
underlying primary psychotic disorder all contributing. In
addition, I cannot rule out underlying character pathology
contributing to her presentation with chronic maladaptive coping
mechanisms.
#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted on a ___, upon
admission, she refused to sign a CV. However, on ___, patient
signed a CV, which was accepted. She maintained her safety
throughout her psychiatric hospitalization on 15 minute checks.
Although irritable at times with staff, she maintained adequate
behavioral control and did not require physical or chemical
restraints.
#. Unspecified Psychotic Disorder: likely multifactorial in
etiology as noted above
- ___ workup including lipid panel, TSH, HbA1c, B12, folate,
RPR, and LFTs were all within normal limits.
- Patient was encouraged to attend groups, but declined to
attend throughout her hospitalization.
- Although patient's did complain of some depressive symptoms,
there seemed to be limited benefit of Zoloft and so this
medication was not restarted in favor of targeting mood symptoms
including irritability with a second generation antipsychotic.
- After discussion of the risks and benefits, patient was
initially started on Risperidone titrated to 2 mg po bid in
addition to 1 mg po q4h prn agitation. Patient did not believe
this medication was effective and expressed concern regarding
the metabolic side effects of risperidone.
- After discussion of the risks and benefits, we started Geodon
60 mg po bid. She tolerated this medication well without side
effects. Her mood improved during her hospitalization; her
depression improved; her voices were lessened. She did endorse
conditional suicidality initially when discussing discharge
several days prior. However, after learning she could live with
her daughter following discharge, her suicidality improved
significantly as did her mood. At time of discharge she had been
consistently denying suicidal ideation or thoughts of self harm
with thought process that was notably linear, goal and future
oriented. She was notably less irritable with her treatment team
- For complaints of insomnia, we restarted Trazodone 100 mg po
qhs for insomnia which she tolerated well with no complaints of
side effects
- Of note, collateral was obtained from her outpatient treaters,
who agreed with our above assessment and plan for patient to
follow up with them following discharge.
- In addition, prior medical records from hospitalizations at
___ in ___ was obtained that revealed history and
presentation similar to above with patient complaining of
suicidal ideation in the setting of homelessness and cocaine
use.
- Patient declined to allow us to have a family meeting prior to
discharge. However, she was amenable to referral to a ___
worker, who will continue to work with the patient as per
discharge worksheet.
.
#. Polysubstance Use Disorder:
- Patient was encouraged to attend AA/NA during her
hospitalization, which she mostly declined.
- Discussed the risks and benefits of avoiding alcohol and
illicit drug use and at time of discharge she did show some
interest in maintaining her sobriety-- she did call numerous
substance abuse programs, but was unable to find a match prior
to discharge. Patient expressed interest in following up with
her psychiatric providers regarding her substance use.
#. Hypertension: ___ has a history of hypertension and has
never before been on medications. During her stay, we began
lisinopril 10 mg QD, which she tolerated well. Her blood
pressures were labile but were maintained in the
120s-150s/60-90s on lisinopril. She will follow up with her PCP
for continued management.
#. Eczema: While ___ was inpatient, her eczema flared behind
her knees and in her elbow creases. We provided her with
diphenhydramine 50mg BID as needed, hydrocortisone ointment BID,
and Vaseline for moisturization.
#. Muscle Spasm: On ___, ___ woke up with back and left
shoulder pain after sleeping improperly on her arm. She had no
concerning symptoms (weakness, decreased sensation) and had full
range of motion on her left arm and shoulder. We encouraged
stretching, heat packs, and ibuprofen as management of this
presumed muscle spasm. She improved over several days.

and dexamethasone 20mg daily on ___. Weaned to oral regimen 
on ___. Due to persistent refractory pain, Ortho spin saw the 
patient, and recommended a repeat lumbar spine MRI to look for 
evidence of a compression fracture; no fracture was noted, and 
the MRI was otherwise stable and unchanged form her last study 
in ___ (had persistent neural-foraminal narrowing at 
L4/L5, as well as degenerative changes and heterogeneous bone 
marrow consistent with her diagnosis of multiple myeloma). On 
discharge, she was prescribed OxyContin 10mg Q8H, as well as PO 
Dilaudid 2mg Q6H:PRN (she was given a 1-week supply of both 
medications). She was maintained on a bowel regimen, and was 
having regular BMs prior to discharge. 

# Multiple Myeloma
On Cycle 1 of RVD; at time of presentation, was C1D4, but had

IMAGING:
--------------------
CXR ___:
Bilateral lower lobe opacities are concerning for multifocal 
pneumonia, 
possibly secondary to aspiration given history of drug abuse.  
Asymmetrical edema is less likely. Recommend follow-up 
radiograph after treatment to assess for resolution. 

CT Chest ___: Extensive ground-glass and more consolidative 
opacities in both lungs predominantly involving posterior 
(dependent) portions of the lungs. Differential diagnosis would 
include multifocal pneumonia versus cocci E in related lung 
changes (crack lung). 
  
Cavitated nodule in the superior segment of right lower lobe is 
highly concerning for septic emboli and does a raising the 
suspicion for infectious endocarditis. Alternatively it can 
represent sequela or part of the infectious process versus 
aspiration although it is discrete nature and absence of other 
consolidated areas of the same density makes that less likely. 

Wrist Xray ___: Normal alignment.  No acute fracture is seen.  
No concerning bone lesion.  No obvious scaphoid fracture.  There 
is some soft tissue swelling. If there is high degree of 
clinical concern for scaphoid fracture, consider repeat imaging 
in ___ days time. 

ECHO ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, 
and global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 64 %). The 
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.

TEE ___:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with 
normal free wall contractility. The ascending, transverse and 
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of 
atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the incisors. The aortic 
valve is tricuspid (clip 20). No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation 
is seen on the mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the 
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. 
Normal biventricular global systolic function. Mild tricuspid 
regurgitation.

___ foot xray:
EXAMINATION:  FOOT AP,LAT AND OBL LEFT 
INDICATION:  ___ year old man with across MCPs.  // rule out 
fracture 
TECHNIQUE:  Three views. 
COMPARISON:  None  
FINDINGS:   
No acute metatarsal fracture is seen.  There is a small plantar 
calcaneal 
spur.  There is mild joint space narrowing and marginal spurring 
at the first metatarsophalangeal joint likely representing mild 
degenerative change. There is a well-circumscribed lucency which 
is relatively large at the base of the great toe proximal 
phalanx, measuring 8 mm, with a thin sclerotic border, likely 
representing a large subchondral cyst. Additional lucency 
projects over the base of the third toe proximal phalanx however 
this is remote from the articular surface. This measures 5 mm 
and is seen on the oblique view only. Minimal degenerative 
spurring at the calcaneocuboid joint.  Small density adjacent to 
the calcaneocuboid joint may reflect accessory ossicle or 
sequela of remote trauma. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
No acute fracture is seen. Prominent subchondral lucency at the 
base of the great toe proximal phalanx most likely degenerative 
cyst. Additional equivocal lucency at the third toe base may 
reflect a incidental lucent lesion such as enchondroma. 
Evaluation of these findings with MRI could be performed if 
clinically indicated. 
 
CT Abd/Pelvis ___: Bladder wall appears mildly thickened.  
While this may be secondary to under
distention, clinical correlation for chronic cystitis is 
advised.

Foot Xray ___: No acute fracture is seen. Prominent subchondral 
lucency at the base of the
great toe proximal phalanx most likely degenerative cyst. 
Additional equivocal lucency at the third toe base may reflect a 
incidental lucent lesion such as enchondroma. Evaluation of 
these findings with MRI could be performed if clinically 
indicated.

Mandible Panorex ___: Several missing teeth.  The mandible 
shows no evidence of osteolytic zones
suspicious for a bone abscess or osteomyelitis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of IVDU (heroin) and 
untreated hepatitis C who was transferred from ___ 
for further evaluation of fevers found to have multifocal 
pneumonia on CT chest and ?septic emboli in lungs and staph 
aureus in urine rising concern for more systemic process.

# Pneumonia: Patient with fevers and leukocytosis on admission. 
CXR suspicious for bibasilar opacities. CT chest obtained which 
showed diffuse ground glass opacities and more consolidative 
opacities bilaterally in posterior portions of the lungs. Likely 
related to aspiration pneumonia in setting of intoxication. Also 
question of possible septic emboli vs scarring from previous 
infection. TTE without any signs of endocarditis and TEE 
obtained which confirmed no endocarditis. He was treated with 
levofloxacin and flagyl. Additionally, MSSA covered as below 
(initially with vancomycin and changed to cefazolin). Ultimately 
narrowed to cefazolin alone and discharged off treatment after 
completing an 8 day course of antibiotics for UTI. The patient 
will need repeat chest CT in about ___ weeks to evaluate the 
lung process for stability or improvement.

# MSSA in Urine: Patient is without urinary symptoms, however is 
growing MSSA. This rasises concern for transient bacteremia 
though all blood cultures were no growth. He was initially 
treated with vancomycin which was changed to cefazolin when 
culture data returned. ID was consulted. CT abd/pelvis obtained 
that showed thickened bladder wall but no other abnormalities. 
Panorex preformed that also did not reveal a source. Ultimately 
the patient reported a previous erythematous lesion over right 
bicep from previous injection site that had resolved but 
potentially a source. Despite first negative TEE, ID recommended 
repeat imaging to increase likelihood of picking up a 
vegetation. Cardiology did not think this was appropriate. 
Cardiology input combined with the fact that the patient refused 
repeat TEE led to a repeat TEE not being performed. In addition, 
patient refused to be discharged to a state facility for IV 
antibiotics (this being the only option given IVDA and lack of 
insurance) and threatened to leave AMA if this was his discharge 
plan. Because of this, PICC line could not be inserted safely. 
Ultimately, due to low likelihood of endocarditis with negative 
TEE while blood cultures were sterile, proof of MSSA infection 
only in the urine and not in the blood, and patient's difficult 
disposition, it was decided to either discharge him on oral 
antibiotics or no antibiotics with close follow up, both of 
which were viable options. The latter was decided on (discharge 
without antibiotics) given completion of course for MSSA in the 
urine. Patient was counseled extensively on warning signs and 
knows to return with fever, sweats, chest pain or other 
concerning symptoms.

# Sternal Tenderness: Initially rising concerns for osteo. 
Likely related to trauma as per report girlfriend and EMS 
rubbing on chest. ESR/CRP negative at OSH on ___. Monitored and 
improved during course.

# Left Wrist Edema and Pain: Reports no trauma. Xray without 
injury. Plastics Hand surgery consulted and felt no 
intervention. Edema and pain improved.

# Left Foot Pain: Across MCPs. Xray showed no acute process. He 
was given 1x dose of colchicine empirically for gout with 
complete resolution of pain. There after treated with Aleve prn.

# Hepatitis C: Untreated. LFTs trending down, likely elevated in 
setting of being found down and substance abuse. Hepatitis 
serologies show not immune to hep A or hep B. Per history 
patient may have received ___ hep B injections a few years ago.
One dose of hep B and hep A vaccination given on ___.
- Transitional:
---Patient will need Hep A #2 
---Consider rechecking hep B serologies to determine immunity 
now that may have received #3 here

# Hypertension: reports remote history of taking anti-HTN 
regimen and SBPs elevated during hospitalization. He was started 
on amlodipine 5mg daily.

# Benzo Withdrawal: Patient reported symptoms of withdrawl and 
was treated with diazapam per CIWA. He was also monitored for 
heroin withdrawl but did not require treatment for this.

# Drug Abuse: SW consulted and patient interested in remaining 
sober. HIV test sent and negative.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Repeat CT chest in ___ weeks to evaluate for stability or 
improvement in lung lesions. If worsening may have to consider 
lung abscess and treat for prolonged course.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization. You were admitted with fevers and bacteria in 
your urine that was suggestive of bacteria in your blood. 
Ultrasound of your heart did not show bacteria on your heart 
valves. You were treated with antibiotics but will not require 
any after discharge. It is very important that you follow up 
with your new PCP and return to the hospital if you have any 
fevers. It is critical that you stop using drugs because this 
can result in significant infection and death.

No changes were made to your medications.

STRESS TEST on ___:
=====================
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old woman with a history of HTN was 

referred to the lab from the ER following negative serial 
cardiac 
markers for evaluation of arm discomfort and fatigue as possible 
anginal 
equivalent. The patient exercised for 4 minutes of ___ 
protocol and 
was stopped for progressive chest/throat burning ___ that began 
one 
minute into exercise. The estimated peak MET capacity was 4.9 
which 
represents a fair functional capacity for her age. During the 
chest/throat discomfort, there was 1-1.5 mm horizontal/scooping 
STD in 
the inferolateral leads and 0.5 mm STE in aVR. The symptoms and 
ST 
changes resolved with rest. The rhythm was sinus with rare 
isolated 
apbs, one atrial triplet and one vpb. Appropriate hemodynamic 
response 
to exercise and recovery. 
IMPRESSION: Ischemic EKG changes with anginal type symptoms 
beginning at 
very low workload. 

CARDIAC CATH on ___:
=====================
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is
moderate tortuosity beginning in the mid segment.
The Septal Perforator, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
small caliber vessel.
The Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
large caliber vessel. There is moderate
tortuosity beginning in the distal segment.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel. There is moderate
tortuosity beginning in the mid segment.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel.
The Acute Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
small caliber vessel.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.

Studies:
--------
CHEST (PA & LAT)  ___ 2:44 ___
FINDINGS: No preoperative examination available. The patient has 
taken a poor inspiration, which may account for much of the 
prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Opacification of the left 
base is consistent with substantial effusion. There may be a 
smaller effusion at the right base. Probable bibasilar 
atelectasis, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia 
cannot be excluded.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  ___ 5:35 ___
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Lung bases show 
small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. 
Small hiatal hernia is present.

The liver shows a small focus of enhancement posteriorly at the 
dome, which may represent a hemangioma. No focal lesion 
identified elsewhere. The patient is status post 
cholecystectomy. Tiny amount of fluid is seen within the 
gallbladder fossa. A biliary stent and subhepatic drain is in 
place. Pneumobilia is present.

The pancreas enhances homogeneously. Fat stranding and fluid is 
seen surrounding the pancreas and extending into the transverse 
mesocolon consistent with history of pancreatitis. The spleen, 
adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits. The 
intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel maintain a normal 
caliber without evidence of obstruction. No free air or 
lymphadenopathy is appreciated. Small amount of free fluid 
tracks along the mesentery. The abdominal aorta maintains a 
normal contour. The celiac, SMA, and ___ are patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid 
colon, bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are within normal 
limits. No free fluid or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is 
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Peripancreatic inflammatory changes consistent with 
pancreatitis. The pancreas enhances homogeneously without 
evidence of necrosis.

2. Pneumobilia consistent with ERCP. Biliary stent and 
subhepatic drain remains in place.

3. Small bilateral pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.

4. 6-mm enhancing focus within the posterior dome of the liver 
which may represent a hemangioma

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year-old man s/p cholecystectomy ___ at ___ 
___ complicated by cystic duct leak, ERCP on ___ with 
sphincterotomy, placement of common bile duct stent who returns 
___ with abdominal pain and found to have post-ERCP 
pancreatitis.

1) Acute Pancreatitis
Kept NPO.  Maintained on IVF.  Given dilaudid IV for pain 
control (initially PCA, later changed to IV push).  Pancreatic 
enzymes trended down during course of hospitaliation and 
abdominal pain gradually improved, then pain and fevers 
recurred, all cx. negative, ultimately thought due to irritation 
from stent and retained stone, repeat ERCP removed both with 
improvement.  At time of d/c, eating, afebrile, cx. neg.
.
2) Trasaminitis
Associated with #1.  Also improved during course of 
hospitalization.
.
3) GERD
Continued on PPI - will take omeprazole for two weeks at d.c
.
4) Cholecystitis s/p cholecystectomy
JP drain in place with only minimal drainage.  Ultimately, this 
was removed by surgery team (after consultation with operating 
surgeon Dr. ___ when small fluid sent showed yeast in 
culture (likely contaminant/colonization of drain), as well as 
streptococcus (also felt to be colonizer) - this discussed with 
ID team and in formal consultation.
.
5) Hyperlipidemia
On Lovastatin, however this was held given acute GI issues.  
Will restart in two weeks via pcp if labs stable.
.
6) Fever/Leukocytosis
Despite therapy with Levaquin post-ERCP, the patient remained 
persistently febrile each day with elevated WBC count and 
inflammatory markers (as above).  Coverage broadened with 
addition of Flagyl.  Had repeat CT as above, which essentially 
showed active pancreatitis.  Given persistence of fevers and 
leukocytosis as well as fungus seen in JP drain, ID team 
consulted.  Felt that these findings were all due to 
pancreatitis.  Recommended stopping flagyl and stopping Levaquin 
after 7-day post-ERCP course (last dose ___.  Fevers 
ultimately resolved only after second ercp with removal of 
retained stone and stent.  
.
7) Anxiety
Was maintained on celexa.

hemorrhage, near complete effacement of right lateral ventricle 
anterior horn. MRI ___ showed multiple ischemic infarcts in the 
right basal ganglia, right temporal lobe, left posterior 
temporal lobe, and bilateral right>L cerebellum.  Given multiple 
areas of ischemia on imaging, history of atrial fibrillation and 
subtherapeutic INR on admission, strokes felt to be 
cardioembolic in origin. Accordingly, to improve adherence, 
favor switching anticoagulation to rivaroxaban following 
discharge. High-intensity statin therapy also initiated for LDL 
of 73.

2. Atrial fibrillation: INR on admission was subtherapeutic at 
1.2. TTE showed no atrial enlargement or obvious thrombus. 
Metoprolol gradually uptitrated to equivalent of home dose due 
to persistent tachycardia.

3. Dysphagia: Following brief period of enteral nutrition via 
NGT, diet was advanced to pureed solids/nectar thick liquids 
following video swallow study. Diet was not changed following 
repeat swallow study, and recommendation was made for close SLP 
follow-up after discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of weakness on the left 
side of your body resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors include:  
 - Atrial fibrillation
 - High blood pressure
 - Mildly elevated cholesterol
  
We are changing your medications as follows:  
 - ADD aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily
 - ADD atorvastatin 40 mg by mouth in the evening

Your aspirin will be changed to a blood thinning medication 
(rivaroxaban) a few days after leaving the hospital. Please take 
your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of migraines, 
who is presenting with a headache and associated symptoms that 
first started 1 week ago. 1 week ago he developed a left sided, 
piercing headache associated with aura of seeing black spots, 
photophobia and nausea. This is different than his typical 
migraines, which he describes as bilateral and improved with ice 
packs and excedrin. Over the next few days, the headaches 
persisted and he developed nausea, nonbloody diarrhea, emesisx1, 
subjective fever and chills, diffuse myalgias and arthalgias, 
and neck stiffness. Symptoms persisted until yesterday, when he 
had an appt with his PCP. Per pt, he was afebrile at his PCPs, 
given ___ shot of toradol, his headache greatly improved. Then 
later in the evening he developed a temp of 101.7, vertigo, and 
felt hearing ""go out"" in his right ear. 

He experienced no mental status changes, no focal neurologic 
changes, no loss of consciousness. No new rashes. He has had no 
recent travel, but reports hiking/running through wooded areas. 
He has seen no ticks on him or his dog, and has never had a tick 
borne illness in the past. He has had no penile, anus, or oral 
lesions, and no history of HSV. Last negative HIV test was ___ 
year ago. 

In the ED, initial vitals were: Temp: 99.7 HR: 107 BP: 146/90 
Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 98 Normal

Labs were notable for: WBC 5.8 (61% N), CSF with 465 WBC, 480 
RBCs, 97% lymphs; repeat 3, 305, 4, 93%. 

EKG was done, and was NSR with normal PR intervals and no heart 
block.

Patient was given: 1 g vancomycin, 2 g ceftriaxone, and 
acyclovir was ordered but does not appear to have been given. He 
was given toradol, zofran, reglan, and 2 L NS. 

On the floor, patient feels improved. He says his headache 
improved after toradol in the ED, but is still present. He still 
has some neck stiffness, myalgias and arthralgias, although all 
improved.

====================================
___ ECG:
Normal sinus rhythm. Tracing is within normal limits. No 
previous tracing
available for comparison.

___ CXR:
IMPRESSION: 
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with no significant past 
medical history, who presents with symptomatology and CSF 
consistent with acute meningitis.

Mr. ___ presented with five days of headache, photophobia, 
myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and two days of fevers and chills, 
no rashes or skin lesions. He presented to the ED, and a lumbar 
puncture was done, he was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, 
acyclovir. The patient's symptoms and CSF were consistent with 
acute meningitis, viral vs lyme. Team was not concerned for 
other bacterial causes as CSF was not consistent with that 
(glucose normal, neg gram stain, primary lymphocytes). TB was 
not a concern because patient was low risk, had no cough, no 
night sweats. Team was also not concerned for foreign associated 
diseases, as patient did not have any recent travels. He had not 
had any drug-exposure to suggest drug-induced meningitis. For 
this reason, patient was only continued on ceftriaxone and 
acyclovir. Headaches were controlled with toradol and nausea 
with zofran. In addition, encephalitis was lower on the

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of migraines,
who is presenting with a headache and associated symptoms that
first started 1 week ago. 1 week ago he developed a left sided,
piercing headache associated with aura of seeing black spots,
photophobia and nausea. This is different than his typical
migraines, which he describes as bilateral and improved with ice
packs and excedrin. Over the next few days, the headaches
persisted and he developed nausea, nonbloody diarrhea, emesisx1,
subjective fever and chills, diffuse myalgias and arthalgias,
and neck stiffness. Symptoms persisted until yesterday, when he
had an appt with his PCP. Per pt, he was afebrile at his PCPs,
given ___ shot of toradol, his headache greatly improved. Then
later in the evening he developed a temp of 101.7, vertigo, and
felt hearing ""go out"" in his right ear.
He experienced no mental status changes, no focal neurologic
changes, no loss of consciousness. No new rashes. He has had no
recent travel, but reports hiking/running through wooded areas.
He has seen no ticks on him or his dog, and has never had a tick
borne illness in the past. He has had no penile, anus, or oral
lesions, and no history of HSV. Last negative HIV test was ___
year ago.
In the ED, initial vitals were: Temp: 99.7 HR: 107 BP: 146/90
Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 98 Normal
Labs were notable for: WBC 5.8 (61% N), CSF with 465 WBC, 480
RBCs, 97% lymphs; repeat 3, 305, 4, 93%.
EKG was done, and was NSR with normal PR intervals and no heart
block.
Patient was given: 1 g vancomycin, 2 g ceftriaxone, and
acyclovir was ordered but does not appear to have been given. He
was given toradol, zofran, reglan, and 2 L NS.

improved after toradol in the ED, but is still present. He still
has some neck stiffness, myalgias and arthralgias, although all
improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with no significant past
medical history, who presents with symptomatology and CSF
consistent with acute meningitis.
Mr. ___ presented with five days of headache, photophobia,
myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and two days of fevers and chills,
no rashes or skin lesions. He presented to the ED, and a lumbar
puncture was done, he was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone,
acyclovir. The patient's symptoms and CSF were consistent with
acute meningitis, viral vs lyme. Team was not concerned for
other bacterial causes as CSF was not consistent with that
(glucose normal, neg gram stain, primary lymphocytes). TB was
not a concern because patient was low risk, had no cough, no
night sweats. Team was also not concerned for foreign associated
diseases, as patient did not have any recent travels. He had not
had any drug-exposure to suggest drug-induced meningitis. For
this reason, patient was only continued on ceftriaxone and
acyclovir. Headaches were controlled with toradol and nausea
with zofran. In addition, encephalitis was lower on the
differential because the patient was mentating well and had no
neurological changes or deficits.
HIV, HSV 1 and 2, Lyme, and enterovirus returned negative. The
patient improved with supportive treatment. He was diagnosed
with viral meningitis, as viral meningitis may often not grow
anything in the CSF and treatment is supportive therapy.

History of Present Illness:
___ yo M w/ hx of bipolar disorder, polysubstance abuse (EtOH, 
cocaine, heroin) referred by his gastroenterologist for new 
onset ascites in the setting of worsening LFTs.

Although he has a longstanding history of EtOH use (pint daily x 
___ years) and IV drug use (heroin), he was relatively well and 
without known liver disease until seven months ago.  In ___ 
he developed severe fatigue; labs drawn by his PCP showed an 
acute, ALT-predominant transaminitis (AST 1188/ALT 1888; LFTs 
normal as of one month prior, ___ and he was found to have 
hepatitis C with a VL of 12 million (per his report, prior 
testing had found him Hep C negative; Hep B and A both negative 
on OSH labs).  Further workup included testing for underlying 
causes of liver disease and was notable primarily for markedly 
elevated Fe indices (ferritin 15,223, Fe 267, TIBC 2168; ___ 
with HFA heterozygosity and screening ___ negative. His LFTs 
continued to deterioriate, peaking in ___ with transaminases 
of AST 967/ ALT 1435, TBili 7.7 (although w/ relatively 
preserved synthetic function - INR ~1.4 - and without 
encephalopathy.  

He came to ___ for outpatient consultation with Dr. ___ in 
___, at which time his LFTs were slowly downtrending but he 
continued to suffer from severe fatigue.  The impression was one 
of multifactorial liver disease: acute hepatitis C superimposed 
on presumed chronic alcoholic liver disease w/ likely 
contribution from Fe-deposition related disease. Expedited 
evaluation as an inpatient was recommended, which he declined at 
that time.  He underwent liver biopsy to elucidate both acute 
and chronic causes of liver injury on ___ this showed 
mild-moderated lymphocytic infiltrate, the absence of overt 
fibrosis and mild Fe deposition and was interpreted as being 
consistent with acute viral hepatitis.  

In subsequent months his LFTs were followed by his local 
gastroenterologist and trended toward normalization, nadiring at 
transaminases in the 300s one month ago (mid ___.  He now 
presents at the urging of his GI doctor as labs drawn yesterday 
showed recurrence of hepatitis with transaminases in the 1000s.  
This is in the setting of 8lb weight gain in the past week with 
increased abdominal distension.

On my interview, he is without acute complaints save the rapid 
onset of abdominal distension. He is on a steady home medication 
regimen including anti-epileptics and anti-depressants but 
denies and new medications, changes to his medications, OTC meds 
or supplements.  He endorses significant fatigue without fever,

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ hx of bipolar disorder, polysubstance abuse (EtOH, 
cocaine, heroin) presenting with new onset ascites in the 
setting of recurrent hepatitis (transaminases had nadired in the 
300s around ___ one month later he presented w/ AST 1100/ALT 
600). ___ extensive work-up was undertaken this admission, it 
revealed no definitive etiology of his acute hepatitis; his 
chronic liver disease remains similarly poorly understood, 
however both will be further characterized by the liver biopsy 
obtained ___.  

#Acute-on-chronic hepatitis:
- ___ he is known to have hepatitis C (and it is thoguht that 
acute hep C accounted for his ___ episode of acute 
hepatitis), his current hepatic inflammation is unexplained by 
either hepatitis C or his presumed alcoholic liver disease.  Of 
note, HCV VL (12million in ___ was down to 1.5 million this 
admission.
- Thorough laboratory search undertaken this admission for 
causes of acute hepatitis, ultimately unrevealing.  DDx includes 
drug-induced liver injury (on several culprit meds chronically, 
but denies recent ingestion of OTC/prescription 
meds/supplements/illicits and w/ negative tox screen), viral 
hepatitis (Hep A and B negative; Hep E pending; other viral 
studies negative), ischemic hepatitis/shock liver (for which he 
is without apparent precipitant)and autoimmune hepatitis ___ 
negative).
- Percutaneous liver biopsy obtained ___ results are pending 
at the time of discharge, but will be finalized by the time of 
his outpatient hepatology appointment next week. 
- Pt to obtain LFTs in one week; results to be faxed to Dr. ___ 
___, these are visible through the Atrius system) 

#Chronic liver disease:  It is furthermore unclear what his 
underlying liver disease is; he is at high risk for alcoholic 
liver disease by history, and HFA heterozygosity in the presence 
of another hepatotoxic disease puts him at risk for cirrhosis 
(which, if present, is not advanced or would not produce 
transaminitis of this magnitude). His current decompensation, 
with evidence of new portal hypertension as evidence by mild 
ascites and splenomegaly, is likely driven by hepatic 
inflammation (no e/o SBP or PVT).  
- Liver biopsy obtained to stage underlying liver disease; 
additionally sent for Fe quantification 
- Ascites was minimal; therapeutic paracentesis performed prior 
to liver bx drained only 1L. Discharged without diuretic on Na 
restricted diet w/ suggested fluid restriction of 2L.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___.
You were admitted to the hospital with abnormal liver tests 
(indicating liver inflammation) and because of new onset of 
swelling in your belly.  We did many blood tests in order to try 
to figure out the cause of your liver inflammation.  In 
addition, we performed a liver biopsy which will help us in 
making a diagnosis.
Unfortunately, we were not able to reach a diagnosis during the 
time you were in the hospital. Hopefully we will be able to find 
a definite diagnosis in the coming weeks as you continue to meet 
with our liver doctors. ___ we know that you have hepatitis C, 
as well as likely have some degree of liver disease from 
drinking alcohol, we are still not sure why your liver tests 
have fluctuated to very high levels over the past several 
months.  
The staff at the ___ (where you previously saw 
Dr. ___ will contact you to arrange follow-up with Dr. ___ 
___ or one of our other hepatologists.  If you do not hear from 
them by ___ morning (___), please call them at 
___.
You will continue taking the same medications that you took 
previously with one exception: please do not take aspirin for 
the next ___ (resume it on ___ morning).  
In addition to having the liver biopsy, you also had one liter 
of fluid drained from your belly on ___.  This fluid 
accumulates as a result of liver disease. In order to prevent 
fluid from building up, try to restrict your total fluid intake 
to around 2 liters daily, and limit the amount of salt in your 
diet.  
Please obtain liver function tests (prescription provided) at 
your primary care appointment next ___ 
(alternatively, obtain liver function tests one day prior to 
your appointment at the ___ so that these will be 
available for Dr. ___.  

We wish you all the best.
Sincerely,
Your ___ Phsycians

STUDIES:
Abd U/S (___): Splenomegaly (15cm), small-mod ascite, patent
portal vein.
PATH:
Liver Bx (___): PENDING
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ hx of bipolar disorder, polysubstance abuse (EtOH,
cocaine, heroin) presenting with new onset ascites in the
setting of recurrent hepatitis (transaminases had nadired in the
300s around ___ one month later he presented w/ AST 1100/ALT
600). ___ extensive work-up was undertaken this admission, it
revealed no definitive etiology of his acute hepatitis; his
chronic liver disease remains similarly poorly understood,
however both will be further characterized by the liver biopsy
obtained ___.
#Acute-on-chronic hepatitis:
- ___ he is known to have hepatitis C (and it is thoguht that
acute hep C accounted for his ___ episode of acute
hepatitis), his current hepatic inflammation is unexplained by
either hepatitis C or his presumed alcoholic liver disease. Of
note, HCV VL (12million in ___ was down to 1.5 million this
admission.
- Thorough laboratory search undertaken this admission for
causes of acute hepatitis, ultimately unrevealing. DDx includes
drug-induced liver injury (on several culprit meds chronically,
but denies recent ingestion of OTC/prescription
meds/supplements/illicits and w/ negative tox screen), viral
hepatitis (Hep A and B negative; Hep E pending; other viral
studies negative), ischemic hepatitis/shock liver (for which he
is without apparent precipitant)and autoimmune hepatitis ___
negative).
- Percutaneous liver biopsy obtained ___ results are pending
at the time of discharge, but will be finalized by the time of
his outpatient hepatology appointment next week.
- Pt to obtain LFTs in one week; results to be faxed to Dr. ___
___, these are visible through the Atrius system)
#Chronic liver disease: It is furthermore unclear what his
underlying liver disease is; he is at high risk for alcoholic
liver disease by history, and HFA heterozygosity in the presence
of another hepatotoxic disease puts him at risk for cirrhosis
(which, if present, is not advanced or would not produce
transaminitis of this magnitude). His current decompensation,
with evidence of new portal hypertension as evidence by mild
ascites and splenomegaly, is likely driven by hepatic
inflammation (no e/o SBP or PVT).
- Liver biopsy obtained to stage underlying liver disease;
additionally sent for Fe quantification
- Ascites was minimal; therapeutic paracentesis performed prior
to liver bx drained only 1L. Discharged without diuretic on Na
restricted diet w/ suggested fluid restriction of 2L.
#Bipolar disorder: continued on effexor, seroquel, and
lamotrigine at home doses
#CAD s/p remote stent: continue home metoprolol; ASA held

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization
at ___.
You were admitted to the hospital with abnormal liver tests
(indicating liver inflammation) and because of new onset of
swelling in your belly. We did many blood tests in order to try
to figure out the cause of your liver inflammation. In
addition, we performed a liver biopsy which will help us in
making a diagnosis.
Unfortunately, we were not able to reach a diagnosis during the
time you were in the hospital. Hopefully we will be able to find
a definite diagnosis in the coming weeks as you continue to meet
with our liver doctors. ___ we know that you have hepatitis C,
as well as likely have some degree of liver disease from
drinking alcohol, we are still not sure why your liver tests
have fluctuated to very high levels over the past several
months.
The staff at the ___ (where you previously saw
Dr. ___ will contact you to arrange follow-up with Dr. ___
___ or one of our other hepatologists. If you do not hear from
them by ___ morning (___), please call them at
___.
You will continue taking the same medications that you took
previously with one exception: please do not take aspirin for
the next ___ (resume it on ___ morning).
In addition to having the liver biopsy, you also had one liter
of fluid drained from your belly on ___. This fluid
accumulates as a result of liver disease. In order to prevent
fluid from building up, try to restrict your total fluid intake
to around 2 liters daily, and limit the amount of salt in your
diet.
Please obtain liver function tests (prescription provided) at
your primary care appointment next ___
(alternatively, obtain liver function tests one day prior to
your appointment at the ___ so that these will be
available for Dr. ___.
We wish you all the best.
Sincerely,
Your ___ Phsycians

microangiopathy. 
  
There is no evidence of acute infarction or shift of normally 
midline 
structures. There is generalized parenchymal volume loss, more 
than expected for ___ age.  Prominence of the ventricular 
system and extra-axial CSF spaces is consistent with the 
previously mentioned parenchymal volume loss. 
  
Major vascular flow voids appear preserved. 
  
There is complete opacification of the right frontal sinus, 
moderate mucosal thickening along the ethmoid air cells and a 
mucous retention cyst along the floor of the left maxillary 
sinus.  Note is made of bilateral lens replacement surgery.  The 
orbits appear otherwise unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
1. Allowing for differences in technique, no significant change 
in size of the small right thalamic hematoma with minimal 
associated edema.

consistent with 
chronic microangiopathy changes. 
  
A mucous retention cyst is seen in the left maxillary sinus.  
There is 
moderate mucosal thickening of the left sphenoid and bilateral 
ethmoid 
sinuses.  There is complete opacification of the right frontal 
sinus.  The 
___ is status post bilateral lens replacement.  The mastoid 
air cells are clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old M w/ hx of HTN, HLD, CAD, COPD, and prior L parietal 
CVA c/b residual RUE paresis and dysarthria who presents with 
findings of thalamic bleed on ___

#Thalamic Hemorrhage: Small thalamic hemorrhage was found on CT 
___ for which ___ was transferred. He had CTA that showed 
stable hemorrhage, extensive chronic microangiopathic disease, 
diffuse atherosclerotic disease. MRI showed hemorrhage with mild 
surrounding edema without evidence of underlying mass or lesion, 
no acute ischemic strokes but re-demonstrated extensive white 
matter changes. He was re-started on ASA 81mg given stable 
bleed. CTA also showed extensive atherosclerotic disease and he 
was re-started on his home atorvastatin 80mg. During admission 
blood pressure ranged from SBP 100s-150s on home blood pressure 
regimen, though ___ reports difficult to control BP as an 
outpatient and having very labile blood pressures in past. 
Etiology of bleed was felt to be likely hypertensive in nature 
given report of labile blood pressures. 

#Subclavian stenosis
#Aortic Aneurysm: ___ was noted to have asymmetric blood 
pressures without any chest pain, SOB, or arm pain. CTA showed 
significant left subclavian stenosis in addition to aortic 
aneurysm. We discussed findings with vascular surgery who said 
there was no urgent indication for inpatient surgery. They felt 
that ___ could follow up with vascular as an outpatient for 
evaluation of possible stenting in the future. Discussed this 
with ___ and he was in agreement. 

#HTN: ___ was continued on his home medications. Of note, he 
had very asymmetric blood pressures which likely due to 
subclavian seen on CTA for which he was referred to vascular 
surgery. 

#COPD: Continued home inhalers. 

#CKD: In review of outpatient labs, Cr baseline around 1.4. Cr 
upon admission 1.4 and trended up to 1.6, slightly above 
baseline. Stable after CTA. 

#Smoking Cessation: ___ counseled to quit smoking. He is not 
interested in quitting smoking and despite counseling about 
risks of vascular disease and recurrent ischemic strokes. 

#Social: ___ family expressed concern about ___ 
safety at home with medical needs. He was seen by social work 
and after discussion with family and ___ felt safe for 
discharge home with skilled nursing.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of nausea and vomiting and 
found to have an acute hemorrhagic stroke, or small area of 
bleeding in your brain.  The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  

You were found to have narrowing of the arteries to goes to your 
left arm, likely the cause of your different blood pressure 
readings in each arm. You also had an aneurysm (out pouching of 
artery) in your aorta. You will need to follow up with vascular 
surgery for this. 

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 - Hyperlipidemia 
 - Hypertension 
 - Active smoking 
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed. 
 
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  You will also need to follow up with Vascular 
surgery to evaluate the vascular stenosis found in your left 
arm. 

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

==========
MRI ___
There is redemonstration of the right thalamic hematoma which,
allowing for differences in technique, does not appear
significantly changed in size. There is minimal associated
vasogenic edema.
There is redemonstration of multiple old lacunar infarcts in the
bilateral
basal ganglia and insula. There are extensive confluent white
matter changes in the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally and in
the pons, nonspecific but suggestive of severe chronic
microangiopathy.
There is no evidence of acute infarction or shift of normally
midline
structures. There is generalized parenchymal volume loss, more
than expected for ___ age. Prominence of the ventricular
system and extra-axial CSF spaces is consistent with the
previously mentioned parenchymal volume loss.
Major vascular flow voids appear preserved.
There is complete opacification of the right frontal sinus,
moderate mucosal thickening along the ethmoid air cells and a
mucous retention cyst along the floor of the left maxillary
sinus. Note is made of bilateral lens replacement surgery. The
orbits appear otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Allowing for differences in technique, no significant change
in size of the small right thalamic hematoma with minimal
associated edema.
2. Extensive white matter changes in the cerebral hemispheres
bilaterally and in the pons, nonspecific but likely a sequela of
severe chronic
microangiopathy. Multiple old lacunar infarcts in the bilateral
basal ganglia and insula.
3. Paranasal sinus disease as described above.
=CTA ___ and Neck
CT ___ WITHOUT CONTRAST:
An intraparenchymal hematoma in the right thalamus is unchanged. There is
minimal surrounding vasogenic edema. There is no evidence of
acute large
territory infarction, ormass. Old lacunar infarcts are seen in
the deep gray nuclei.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent global
cerebral volume
loss. Confluent periventricular hypodensities are most
consistent with
chronic microangiopathy changes.
A mucous retention cyst is seen in the left maxillary sinus.
There is
moderate mucosal thickening of the left sphenoid and bilateral
ethmoid
sinuses. There is complete opacification of the right frontal
sinus. The
___ is status post bilateral lens replacement. The mastoid
air cells are clear.
CTA ___:
Atherosclerotic changes of the cavernous and supraclinoid
segments of the
bilateral internal carotid arteries are seen with moderate
narrowing of the cavernous ICAs with patent distal flow.
Otherwise, the vessels of the circle of ___ and their
principal
intracranial branches appear normal without stenosis, occlusion,
or aneurysm formation. There is fetal origin of the right and
fetal type origin of the left posterior cerebral arteries.
The dural venous sinuses are patent.
CTA NECK:
There is a large focal fusiform aneurysm in the mid aortic arch,
measuring 3.7 cm. Extensive atherosclerotic changes of the
aortic arch and origins of the great vessels are seen. There is
severe narrowing of the proximal left subclavian artery with
patent distal flow. A 2 vessel aortic arch is seen. There is
no significant stenosis at the origins of the vertebral and
carotid arteries.
Atherosclerotic changes of the carotid bifurcations are seen
with 50% right and 40% left narrowing of the internal carotid
arteries, by NASCET criteria.
The vertebral arteries appear normal with no evidence of
stenosis or
occlusion.
OTHER:
A small right pleural effusion is seen. Biapical emphysematous
changes are seen. The visualized portion of the thyroid gland
is within normal limits. There is no lymphadenopathy by CT size
criteria. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are seen
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged right thalamic intraparenchymal hematoma with
minimal surrounding vasogenic edema. No acute large territory
infarct.
2. Extensive chronic microangiopathy changes.
3. Moderate narrowing of the cavernous ICAs secondary to
atheromatous changes with patent distal flow. Otherwise patent
circle of ___.
4. Atherosclerotic changes of the carotid bifurcations with 50%
right and 40% left narrowing of the ICAs, by NASCET criteria.
5. Patent cervical vertebral arteries.
6. Large focal fusiform aneurysm of the mid aortic arch,
measuring 3.7 cm.
7. Severe narrowing of the proximal left subclavian artery with
patent distal flow.
8. Small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old M w/ hx of HTN, HLD, CAD, COPD, and prior L parietal
CVA c/b residual RUE paresis and dysarthria who presents with
findings of thalamic bleed on ___
#Thalamic Hemorrhage: Small thalamic hemorrhage was found on CT
___ for which ___ was transferred. He had CTA that showed
stable hemorrhage, extensive chronic microangiopathic disease,
diffuse atherosclerotic disease. MRI showed hemorrhage with mild
surrounding edema without evidence of underlying mass or lesion,
no acute ischemic strokes but re-demonstrated extensive white
matter changes. He was re-started on ASA 81mg given stable
bleed. CTA also showed extensive atherosclerotic disease and he
was re-started on his home atorvastatin 80mg. During admission
blood pressure ranged from SBP 100s-150s on home blood pressure
regimen, though ___ reports difficult to control BP as an
outpatient and having very labile blood pressures in past.
Etiology of bleed was felt to be likely hypertensive in nature
given report of labile blood pressures.
#Subclavian stenosis
#Aortic Aneurysm: ___ was noted to have asymmetric blood
pressures without any chest pain, SOB, or arm pain. CTA showed
significant left subclavian stenosis in addition to aortic
aneurysm. We discussed findings with vascular surgery who said
there was no urgent indication for inpatient surgery. They felt
that ___ could follow up with vascular as an outpatient for
evaluation of possible stenting in the future. Discussed this
with ___ and he was in agreement.
#HTN: ___ was continued on his home medications. Of note, he
had very asymmetric blood pressures which likely due to
subclavian seen on CTA for which he was referred to vascular
surgery.
#COPD: Continued home inhalers.
#CKD: In review of outpatient labs, Cr baseline around 1.4. Cr
upon admission 1.4 and trended up to 1.6, slightly above
baseline. Stable after CTA.
#Smoking Cessation: ___ counseled to quit smoking. He is not
interested in quitting smoking and despite counseling about
risks of vascular disease and recurrent ischemic strokes.
#Social: ___ family expressed concern about ___
safety at home with medical needs. He was seen by social work
and after discussion with family and ___ felt safe for
discharge home with skilled nursing.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of nausea and vomiting and
found to have an acute hemorrhagic stroke, or small area of
bleeding in your brain. The brain is the part of your body that
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result
in a variety of symptoms.
You were found to have narrowing of the arteries to goes to your
left arm, likely the cause of your different blood pressure
readings in each arm. You also had an aneurysm (out pouching of
artery) in your aorta. You will need to follow up with vascular
surgery for this.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke.
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk
factors. Your risk factors are: - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension - Active smoking
Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician
as listed below. You will also need to follow up with Vascular
surgery to evaluate the vascular stenosis found in your left
arm.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur,
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of
these symptoms: - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to
you - Sudden weakness of one side of the body - Sudden drooping of one side of the face - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body Sincerely, Your ___ Neurology Team

Pt adamantly denying SI, intent, or plan, SIB impulses 
throughout admission. She recognized cutting as a stress relief 
technique was ""a mistake, I need to process things differently

apartment and would stay with her the next few weeks which the 
pt was agreeable to. The pt agreed to followup with a ___ 
therapist and psychiatrist as an outpatient; she refused meds 
offered and DBT partial hospital services offered as she was 
concerned with missing more time from school, ""since I have a 
big test tomorrow"". She did acknowledge that following up with a

lately and not sharing how I really felt. that got me into 
trouble and drove me to cut."" Given the continued lack of SI, 
SIB, the successful resolutions reached at the ""family"" meeting,

Brief Hospital Course:
*****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES*****
#Discharged with oral pain medications (acetaminophen and 
tramadol) as a bridge to next Remicade infusion. Patient 
instructed not to take any NSAIDs given concern for GI bleeding.
#Valsartan, amlodipine held at discharge given soft blood 
pressures
#ASA held at discharge, re-started apixaban
#Seen by cardiology, consider p-MIBI as outpatient once GI 
bleeding resolved. 
# ___ need outpatient ___ to look for source. 

___ year old female with history of ankylosing spondylitis who 
was taking NSAIDs in the setting of missing a Remicade infusion 
who presented with hypotension in the setting of melana x 1 week 
complicated by EKG changes, minimal troponin elevation, and 
acute renal failure. 

#Melana: Upon admission, her blood pressure and anticoagulant 
medications were held given concern for potential ongoing GI 
bleeding. During the stay her vital signs and CBC remained 
stable. She did not have any ongoing melena. We restarted her 
beta blocker in the hospital because she started to have 
asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with RVR. Her anticoagulation 
was restarted once it was determined she was not having a 
clinically significant, active GI bleed. We did not re-start her 
valsartan since her BP was soft, but stable, at the time of 
discharge. Aspirin continued to be held at discharge

#EKG changes: Seen by cardiology for T wave inversions in the 
setting of hypotension, troponin peaked at 0.03, likely in the 
setting of hypotension.  Recommended a non urgent stress test as 
an outpatient. 
- Outpatient p-MIBI once stable

___: Likely pre-renal,  responded to IVF and resolved at 
discharge. 

#Atrial Fibrillation: In the setting of discontinuing her beta 
blocker there was a short period of asymptomatic RVR.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came to the hospital because your blood pressure was low.

Given your black stools, we think the source of bleeding is 
somewhere in your stomach or intestines.  This is likely given 
all of the anti-inflammatory pain medications you were taking 
recently.  

During the hospitalization your blood counts were stable and 
there were no signs or symptoms of continued active bleeding.  
You can discuss with your primary care doctor the need for 
further evaluation for this problem. 

You were also seen by cardiology because the EKG (a way to 
monitor the electrical activity of your heart) was concerning.  
They believe that this was most likely caused by the stress 
placed on your heart by the bleeding.  Please follow up with 
your outpatient cardiologist for further evaluation, which may 
include stress testing. 

Please call your rheumatologist to schedule another infusion. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay. 

Sincerely, 

Your ___ team

#ASA held at discharge, re-started apixaban
#Seen by cardiology, consider p-MIBI as outpatient once GI
bleeding resolved.
# ___ need outpatient ___ to look for source.
___ year old female with history of ankylosing spondylitis who
was taking NSAIDs in the setting of missing a Remicade infusion
who presented with hypotension in the setting of melana x 1 week
complicated by EKG changes, minimal troponin elevation, and
acute renal failure.
#Melana: Upon admission, her blood pressure and anticoagulant
medications were held given concern for potential ongoing GI
bleeding. During the stay her vital signs and CBC remained
stable. She did not have any ongoing melena. We restarted her
beta blocker in the hospital because she started to have
asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with RVR. Her anticoagulation
was restarted once it was determined she was not having a
clinically significant, active GI bleed. We did not re-start her
valsartan since her BP was soft, but stable, at the time of
discharge. Aspirin continued to be held at discharge
#EKG changes: Seen by cardiology for T wave inversions in the
setting of hypotension, troponin peaked at 0.03, likely in the
setting of hypotension. Recommended a non urgent stress test as
an outpatient.
- Outpatient p-MIBI once stable
___: Likely pre-renal, responded to IVF and resolved at
discharge.
#Atrial Fibrillation: In the setting of discontinuing her beta
blocker there was a short period of asymptomatic RVR.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You came to the hospital because your blood pressure was low.
Given your black stools, we think the source of bleeding is
somewhere in your stomach or intestines. This is likely given
all of the anti-inflammatory pain medications you were taking
recently.
During the hospitalization your blood counts were stable and
there were no signs or symptoms of continued active bleeding.
You can discuss with your primary care doctor the need for
further evaluation for this problem.
You were also seen by cardiology because the EKG (a way to
monitor the electrical activity of your heart) was concerning.
They believe that this was most likely caused by the stress
placed on your heart by the bleeding. Please follow up with
your outpatient cardiologist for further evaluation, which may
include stress testing.
Please call your rheumatologist to schedule another infusion.
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay.
Sincerely,
Your ___ team

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old female with PMHx significant for 
hypertension, migraines, IBS who had a witness syncopal event at 
home. 

 Patient's family states that she has been battling a viral 
illness for the last month. Initially she had a sinus infection 
in ___, and possibly upper respiratory infection. Per family, 
she was treated with a course of antibiotics, however, given no 
improvement, she was treated with a second course of antibiotics 
and a course of prednisone. The family is unable to comment what 
antibiotics were given, however per medication history, it 
appears to be erythromycin x 7 day course (___) followed by 
levofloxacin and seven day burst of prednisone. She was also 
treated with doxycycline ___. Per her family about two 
weeks ago she started having sore throat, nonproductive cough, 
and continued to have rhinorrhea with purulent drainage. At this 
time she developed a red rash on her cheeks bilaterally, on the 
dorsal surfaces of her arms b/l. This did improve over time. Per 
her PCP, she called her PCP ___ complaining about the itchy 
rash, and thought it was drug induced from a new medication 
valsartan, and subsequently changed to losartan. She sought 
evaluation from outpatient infectious disease clinic, and 
received diagnosis of ""hand foot mouth disease"". Per PCP, had 
mild leukocytosis, +EBV, +Parvo IgG. The patient's family state 
that she has had symptoms of exhaustion and fatigue, also c/o 
joint pains. Otherwise they say that she was not forthcoming 
with her symptoms, and cannot comment on urinary discomfort, 
abdominal pain or other symptoms. They do state that she had 
been having subjective fevers at home. 

 They state that the day before the event, she was feeling 
better and knitting. On the day of the event, she had a sudden 
sudden witnessed event with questional LOC at home. Bystander 
CPR for very brief period. EMS on arrival found the patient with 
a pulse, following commands, non verbal but able to squeeze 
hand; she developed irregular agonal breathing, and was 
intubated on the scene. EKG reportedly on arrival with Atrial 
fibrillation in ___. Subsequent EKG with anterior/lateral 
elevation with reciprocal changes. 

In the ED, initial vitals were:  variable lack of pulses, 
difficult to palpate BP ___- 100s SBP. Started on levophed with 
multiple phenylephrine pushes. 

EKG on arrival with STEMI V2-V5; Bedside echo c/w anterior 
STEMI, EF 30% and RWMA. 

Arterial line and CVL placed emergently in the ED. Patient taken 
directly to cath lab.

In cath lab, patient started on lidocaine and amiodarone. IABP 
placed at bedside given BPs 90/50. She had >10 VF arrests in the 
cath labs, with ROSC after cardioversion. She was started on 
dopamine and vasopressin in addition to norephinphrine. She was 
given multiple doses of sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, 
and magnesium bolus. LHC with mild disease, no intervention. RHC 
with elevated filling pressures. Patient transferred to the ICU. 
 

On arrival to the ICU, she had multiple brief episodes of VF 
arrest requiring cardioversion despite amiodarone and lidocaine 
gtt. She was given 1.25 Lopressor IV with improvement of ectopy 
and briefly on esmolol. Patient dyssynchronous on the vent -- 
required 60 mg rocuronium, sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. 
Patient started on Artic Sun for cooling protocol. CVL exchanged 
sterilely. Patient started on broad spectrum antibiotics given 
bandemia; stress dose hydrocortisone administered given 
eosinophilia and h/o steroid use. 

Given concern for RLE pallor, lack of dopplerable pulses, 
Vascular surgery assessed at bedside. No acute pathology per 
their evaluation, IV heparin if able to tolerate.

Portable CTH completed at bedside, c/f R cerebral edema 
involving MCA +/- ACA, PCA territory and midline shift. 
Neurosurgery and Neurology evaluated at bedside, consistent with 
anoxic brain injury, no intervention noted at this time. 

Met with family that endorsed the above history. PCP contacted 
overnight, verified above history, will given further details in 
AM.  Patient intubated and sedated, unable to provide history.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================
___ - Portable head CT non-contrast
1. Overlying hardware streak artifact limits examination. 
2. Evolution of right MCA distribution infarct with interval 
increase of 
severe edema, right-to-left midline shift, uncal and cerebellar 
herniation. 
3. New left lateral ventricle temporal horn is enlarged, 
concerning with 
obstructive hydrocephalus. 
4. No definite evidence of infarct hemorrhagic transformation. 

___ - RUQ ultrasound
1. No biliary dilatation identified.  The gallbladder is not 
visualized.  
Echogenic foci in the region of the gallbladder fossa raises the 
question of surgical clips/ possible prior cholecystectomy. 
2. Small echogenic structure in the left lobe of the liver.  In 
the absence of underlying liver disease this probably represents 
a hemangioma.  If the patient is found to have underlying liver 
disease this lesion could be further evaluated with CT or MRI or 
short-term followup ultrasound could be performed to assess 
stability. 

___ - Art duplex ultrasounds 
Patent left femoral popliteal vessels with velocities as noted.  
No flow noted below the knee. 

___ - CT Head non-contrast - portable - 
1. Interval evolution of right cerebral infarct with increased 
edema and mass effect. 
2. No evidence of hemorrhage. 

___ - CXR (portable AP) -

segments and apex proper are severeyly hypokinetic/akinetic. No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The aortic valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an 
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 


 IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular chamber size with severe 
systolic dysfunction with regional variation as described 
consistent with multivessel CAD versus non-coronary etiology 
(myocarditis, toxic/metabolic). Mild to moderate eccentric 
aortic regurgitation.

___ - CT Head non-contrast (portable)

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with no significant PMHx presenting to the 
CCU after witnessed syncopal event, multiple episodes of VF 
arrest, now with hypoxic respiratory failure and shock of 
unknown etiology. On HD3, patient was found to have R pupil 
fixation/dilation. Repeat NCHCT was concerning for worsening of 
edema and herniation. Neurology examined patient and determined 
she had undergone a catastrophic neurological event with CT 
imaging concerning for uncal herniation and fixed dilated R 
pupil. The family including husband/HCP requested that patient 
be terminally extubated with comfort measures only. The patient 
died shortly thereafter.

of unclear etiology. Likely mixed cardiogenic and distributive 
shock given bedside echocardiogram findings and septic 
physiology. Patient with high bandemia, eosinophils (Abs Eos 
880), appeared volume responsive. Pressors were discontinued 
when patient's goals of care were transitioned to comfort 
measures only.

# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with hypoxic respiratory 
failure after post-cardiac arrest. High pulmonary wedge 
pressures c/w cardiogenic cause, although cannot completely r/o 
ARDs. 

#) ST ELEVATIONS/TROPONINEMIA: Patient presented with diffuse 
STE concerning for STEMI. ___ also have diffuse PR depression, 
preceding viral prodrome c/w myopericarditis. CTH excluded SAH. 
Aortic dissection not found on cath
 
#) R MCA STROKE: Patient with R cerebral edema with complete 
effacement of sulci, L midshift. Neurosurgery and Neurology

# TRANSAMINITIS: Likely shock liver in setting of multiple VFib 
arrests. ___ also consider viral etiology v. inflammatory 
etiology

# NON-ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient with normal osm gap; 
Nl AG despite high lactates, normal globulin gap which is 
unusual. Consider RTA -- s/p 4 amps bicarbonate overnight with 
improvement  

# HYPERGLYCEMIA: Not c/w DKA given no ketones on urinalysis. 
Initially presented in 400s, therefore now high enough to be 
considered hyperosmolar hypoketotic. Likely stress response, 
persisted in setting of stress dose steroids. She was treated 
with insulin gtt followed by sliding scale.

# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Likely d/t reactive in setting of bone 
marrow suppression. Considered HITT, although no recent 
hospitalization or heparin exposure making this less likely.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with no significant PMHx presenting to the
CCU after witnessed syncopal event, multiple episodes of VF
arrest, now with hypoxic respiratory failure and shock of
unknown etiology. On HD3, patient was found to have R pupil
fixation/dilation. Repeat NCHCT was concerning for worsening of
edema and herniation. Neurology examined patient and determined
she had undergone a catastrophic neurological event with CT
imaging concerning for uncal herniation and fixed dilated R
pupil. The family including husband/HCP requested that patient
be terminally extubated with comfort measures only. The patient
died shortly thereafter.
# CORONARIES: no obstructive disease

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with history of OCD and autism 
spectrum disorder who presents as a transfer from ___ with 
2 days of fevers and headache concerning for CNS infection.

The patient originally presented to ___ with 48 hours of 
fevers and bifrontal headache. He also reported one day of 
chills, nausea and vomiting, but denied neck pain or visual 
disturbance. Of note he says that multiple people in his summer 
camp program at ___ have recently had the same 
symptoms (fevers, headache, and nausea/vomiting) which improved 
on their own. He underwent CT head at ___ as part of 
workup for meningitis which showed multiple punctate parenchymal 
hyperdensities and hypodensities suspicious for punctate 
hemorrhages and microabscesses. He was started on ceftriaxone, 
vancomycin, and flagyl. LP was deferred given concern for 
microabscesses, and he was transferred to ___ for further 
work-up and neurology/neurosurgery evaluation.

In the ED, initial vitals were: T 98.9, HR 84, BP 109/62, RR 16, 
SPO2 98% RA. While in the ED he fevered to 100.8. Exam was 
notable for a nonfocal neurologic exam and a II/VI systolic 
ejection murmur. Labs were notable for WBC 17.4 with 
neutrophilic predominance, Hgb 13.1, and CRP 39.2. Neurosurgery 
was consulted
in the ED who said no urgent or emergent NSGY intervention is 
indicated. Neurology was consulted who recommended brain MRI 
given that the superficial location of the largest parenchymal 
hyperdensity raised question of associated cortical vein 
thrombosis. MRI brain was obtained and was essentially normal 
with no hemorrhage, masses, or thrombosis. LP was performed and 
fluid studies were not consistent with meningitis. While in the 
ED he received dexamethasone 4mg IV and ceftriaxone 2gm. He was 
admitted to medicine for an infectious workup.

On arrival to the floor, he reports that his headache is 
currently barely there, and he only notices it when he sits up. 
He is not currently nauseous, and says that he only threw up 
after taking medications on an empty stomach. He denies rashes, 
dysuria or other urinary symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
congestion, coughing, or shortness of breath. He denies tick 
exposures but has been hiking in the woods recently. He denies 
recreational drug use or sexual activity. He recently traveled 
to ___ and ___.

==================== 
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with history of OCD and autism
spectrum disorder who presents as a transfer from ___ with
2 days of fevers and headache originally concerning for CNS
infection. OSH CT was initially read as cf microabscesses but
final read was updated to concerns of SAH, now with reassuring 
LP
with low RBC count without xanthochromia. Infectious workup 
negative with repeat MRI negative for any intracranial process - 
given remarkable improvement and negative workup, ultimately 
diagnosed with viral syndrome and discharged home.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Patient and parents notified to return to ED if any concerning 
symptoms/signs such as fever, chills, return of moderate/severe 
headache. Otherwise no follow-up required. 
- NO follow up imaging recommended from neurosurgery or 
neurology

ACUTE ISSUES:
================
# Fever
# Leukocytosis
# Headache
# Nausea and vomiting
The patient presented with 2 days of bifrontal headache and 
fevers, and one day of chills, nausea, and emesis. Labs notable 
for leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and bandemia. 
Head CT at ___ showed left frontal hyperdensity cf acute 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (this was initially read as cf 
microabscesses but was revised as documented above).  both 
neurology and neurosurgery were consulted and reviewed this -  
However, brain MRI here was normal, and most importantly LP was 
clear and colorless with RBCs of 80 and 17 (likely from 
hemorrhagic tap). Given low RBC count and negative MRI, ___ was 
felt unlikely by both neurology and neurosurgery and they 
recommended no further evaluation was necessary. There was 
initial concern for meningitis due to his headache and fevers, 
but this is unlikely reassuring LP, no nuchal rigidity, no AMS. 
There was no evidence of endocarditis on TTE. Blood cultures 
have had NGTD. On the day of discharge pt feels much improved 
with fevers, HA, and chills all resolved, downtrending WBC. 
Patient received dexamethasone 4mg IV in the ED and was 
continued on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin until blood cultures 
were negative for 48h hours and patient's symptoms had resolved. 
UTI and pulm infection also unlikely without symptoms and 
negative UA/CXR. Tick-borne illness panel checked at ___ 
and was negative.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with history of OCD and autism
spectrum disorder who presents as a transfer from ___ with
2 days of fevers and headache concerning for CNS infection.
The patient originally presented to ___ with 48 hours of
fevers and bifrontal headache. He also reported one day of
chills, nausea and vomiting, but denied neck pain or visual
disturbance. Of note he says that multiple people in his summer
camp program at ___ have recently had the same
symptoms (fevers, headache, and nausea/vomiting) which improved
on their own. He underwent CT head at ___ as part of
workup for meningitis which showed multiple punctate parenchymal
hyperdensities and hypodensities suspicious for punctate
hemorrhages and microabscesses. He was started on ceftriaxone,
vancomycin, and flagyl. LP was deferred given concern for
microabscesses, and he was transferred to ___ for further
work-up and neurology/neurosurgery evaluation.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 98.9, HR 84, BP 109/62, RR 16,
SPO2 98% RA. While in the ED he fevered to 100.8. Exam was
notable for a nonfocal neurologic exam and a II/VI systolic
ejection murmur. Labs were notable for WBC 17.4 with
neutrophilic predominance, Hgb 13.1, and CRP 39.2. Neurosurgery
was consulted
in the ED who said no urgent or emergent NSGY intervention is
indicated. Neurology was consulted who recommended brain MRI
given that the superficial location of the largest parenchymal
hyperdensity raised question of associated cortical vein
thrombosis. MRI brain was obtained and was essentially normal
with no hemorrhage, masses, or thrombosis. LP was performed and
fluid studies were not consistent with meningitis. While in the
ED he received dexamethasone 4mg IV and ceftriaxone 2gm. He was
admitted to medicine for an infectious workup.
On arrival to the floor, he reports that his headache is
currently barely there, and he only notices it when he sits up.
He is not currently nauseous, and says that he only threw up
after taking medications on an empty stomach. He denies rashes,
dysuria or other urinary symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
congestion, coughing, or shortness of breath. He denies tick
exposures but has been hiking in the woods recently. He denies
recreational drug use or sexual activity. He recently traveled
to ___ and ___.

====================
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with history of OCD and autism
spectrum disorder who presents as a transfer from ___ with
2 days of fevers and headache originally concerning for CNS
infection. OSH CT was initially read as cf microabscesses but
final read was updated to concerns of SAH, now with reassuring
LP
with low RBC count without xanthochromia. Infectious workup
negative with repeat MRI negative for any intracranial process -
given remarkable improvement and negative workup, ultimately
diagnosed with viral syndrome and discharged home.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Patient and parents notified to return to ED if any concerning
symptoms/signs such as fever, chills, return of moderate/severe
headache. Otherwise no follow-up required.
- NO follow up imaging recommended from neurosurgery or
neurology
ACUTE ISSUES:
================
# Fever
# Leukocytosis
# Headache
# Nausea and vomiting
The patient presented with 2 days of bifrontal headache and
fevers, and one day of chills, nausea, and emesis. Labs notable
for leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and bandemia.
Head CT at ___ showed left frontal hyperdensity cf acute
subarachnoid hemorrhage (this was initially read as cf
microabscesses but was revised as documented above). both
neurology and neurosurgery were consulted and reviewed this -
However, brain MRI here was normal, and most importantly LP was
clear and colorless with RBCs of 80 and 17 (likely from
hemorrhagic tap). Given low RBC count and negative MRI, ___ was
felt unlikely by both neurology and neurosurgery and they
recommended no further evaluation was necessary. There was
initial concern for meningitis due to his headache and fevers,
but this is unlikely reassuring LP, no nuchal rigidity, no AMS.
There was no evidence of endocarditis on TTE. Blood cultures
have had NGTD. On the day of discharge pt feels much improved
with fevers, HA, and chills all resolved, downtrending WBC.
Patient received dexamethasone 4mg IV in the ED and was
continued on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin until blood cultures
were negative for 48h hours and patient's symptoms had resolved.
UTI and pulm infection also unlikely without symptoms and
negative UA/CXR. Tick-borne illness panel checked at ___
and was negative.

CXR 1 view:
SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged. 
The aorta is 
slightly tortuous. There is fullness of the hila bilaterally and 
there is 
mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Linear opacities within the 
right upper 
lobe may reflect scarring and chronic changes. There is likely 
mild streaky 
opacity in left lung base, reflective of atelectasis. No focal 
consolidation, 
pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is visualized. No definite 
displaced rib 
fractures are seen; however, the left lateral ribs are not 
completely included 
in the field of view. 
  
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Probable left 
basilar 
atelectasis and chronic changes within the right upper lobe. 

Pelvis Xray - 1 view:
AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: No definite 
fracture or 
dislocation is present. There is diffuse demineralization of the 
osseous 
structures which limits the detection for subtle fractures. The 
right leg is 
rotated, though no distinct fracture line is visible. There are 
mild 
degenerative changes in both hips with joint space narrowing. No 
diastasis of 
the pubic symphysis or sacroiliac joints is seen. There are 
diffuse vascular 
calcifications. Extensive degenerative changes are noted within 
the imaged 
aspect of the right knee with joint space narrowing, subchondral 
sclerosis and 
osteophyte formation. A moderate-sized suprapatellar joint 
effusion is also 
noted. 
  
IMPRESSION: Rotation of the right femur, but no definite 
fracture or 
dislocation. If there is continued clinical concern for an 
occult fracture, a 
CT is recommended for further evaluation. 

Femur Xray - 2view:
AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: No definite

CT is recommended for further evaluation. 

Hip Xray: 2 view
AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: No definite 
fracture or

CT C-spine without contrast:
FINDINGS: Non-displaced fractures are present at the left 
transverse 
processes of T1 and T2 (601B:32). No acute vertebral body 
fractures are seen. 
There is a chronic wedge compression deformity of T2 (602B:36). 
Severe 
multilevel degenerative changes are seen throughout the cervical 
spine, worst 
at C3/4 and the C6/7, there is loss of intervertebral disc space 
with endplate 
sclerosis and subchondral cystic changes. Subluxation of 
multiple facets are 
compatible with severe osteoarthropathy. Included views of the 
lung apices 
demonstrate scarring and pleural calcifications, as seen on the 
prior chest 
radiograph (5:61). 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Non-displaced fractures of the left T1 and T2 transverse 
processes. 
2. Chronic wedge compression deformity at T2. 
3. Severe multilevel degenerative changes throughout the 
cervical spine. 

CT Head noncontrast ___:
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. Numerous bifrontal and left temporal intraparenchymal 
hematomas, unchanged 
in appearance since the 1:01 p.m. study, with new trace 
intraventricular 
extension. Findings are most compatible with traumatic contusion 
injuries. If 
the diagnosis is in doubt and amyloid angiopathy is being 
entertained as a 
potential diagnosis, then MR may be of potential value in 
further assessment.  
  
  
2. Very small subdural hygromas, not significantly changed and 
also 
supporting the probability of a traumatic etiology. 

Head Ct noncontrast ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1. Bifrontal and left temporal horn parenchymal hemorrhage, 
largely unchanged 
in distribution compared to the prior with some likely 
evolution- i.e. 
slightly increased focus of hemorrhage at left frontal lobe 
(2,20) and 
slightly less prominent foci at the left frontal lobe at the 
vertex (2, 
23)when compared to the comparable level and allowing for 
differences in 
technique. 2. Small subdural hygromas stable.  
3. Minimally increased vasogenic edema particularly at the level 
of the the 
left frontal lobe at the vertex (2, 23).  
4. Stable layering blood in the occipital horns bilaterally. 

MRI Head without contrast:
FINDINGS: Multiple foci of blood products are seen in both 
frontal lobes, 
left temporal lobe and intraventricular blood is also 
identified. There are 
bilateral small subdural collections seen extending from frontal 
to the 
occipital region with a maximum width of approximately 6 mm on 
the left and 5 
mm on the right side. There is mild indentation on the adjacent 
sulci seen. 
  
On the susceptibility images, the areas of blood products 
corresponding to the 
CT abnormality are identified. There are no additional foci seen 
to indicate 
underlying microhemorrhages. 
  
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen. Mild changes of 
small vessel 
disease are noted. 
  
IMPRESSION: Blood products in both frontal and left temporal 
region likely 
due to hemorrhagic contusions, although the locations of the 
abnormalities are 
somewhat atypical. No evidence of chronic microhemorrhages seen 
in other 
parts of the brain to suggest underlying abnormality. Small 
bilateral 
subdural collections are seen. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Service at ___ on 
___ after sustaining multiple falls with confusion. Imaging 
of his head showed several areas of hemorrhage in bifrontal and 
left temporal areas.
.
The patient was kept in the ICU for several days for close 
observation and then transferred to the floor. He was cleared 
from his c-collar medically while in the ICU. His coumadin was 
held during his stay and his goal SBP was <160. Hydralazine was 
given as necessary to keep within these parameters, although the 
patient autoregulated well during his stay. He was started on 
Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
.
The patient also had an issue with hypernatremia and was started 
on normal saline at 70 cc/hr for treatment. He should get labs 
daily at rehab, and may need further treamtent for his 
hypernatremia.
.
One of the major issues during his stay was his mental status. 
The majority of his stay he was not oriented to person, place, 
or time. On discharge he is oriented to place and year.
.
He was not able to pass a speech and swallow evaluation until 
___ as he would not swallow, but was cleared for pureed solids 
and thin liquids with meds given crushed in puree. The patient 
should be under observation when eating. This should be 
re-evaluated at rehab to see if diet can be advanced.
. 
Once leaving rehab, the patient will need to followup with his 
PCP, ___ in reference to restarting warfarin. He was 
stopped due to intracranial hemorrhages. Having atrial 
fibrillation puts him at risk for embolic strokes. Since he has 
a history of falls, his primary care physician should assess him 
as an outpatient to evaluate the risks and benefits of 
restarting coumadin. His simvastatin and lopressor doses were 
not known, and he will not go to rehab on either medication. He 
should followup with his PCP about restarting these medications 
after rehab.
.
He will need followup with Dr. ___ on ___ and get a head 
CT one week before this appointment. He will need followup with 
his PCP, ___ one week of leaving rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the Neurology Service at ___ on ___ 
after sustaining multiple falls with confusion. Imaging of your 
head showed several areas of hemorrhage in your brain.
.
You were taking coumadin for your atrial fibrillation. This 
medication was held during your stay as it can increase 
hemorrhages in your brain. Your blood pressure was also kept 
below a certain level for treatment. 
. 
You were initially in the ICU for close monitoring, and then 
transferred to the floor once stable.
. 
You were started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis which you 
will go to rehab on and continue until your appointment with Dr. 
___ on ___. Once leaving rehab, you will need to followup 
with your PCP, ___ in reference to restarting your 
warfarin. You were stopped due to the hemorrhages in your brain. 
Having atrial fibrillation puts you at risk for blood clots 
which can cause strokes. Since you have a history of falls, your 
primary care physician should assess you as an outpatient to 
evaluate the risks and benefits of restarting coumadin. Your 
simvastatin and lopressor doses were not known, and you will not 
go to rehab on either medication. You should followup with your 
PCP about restarting these medications after rehab.
.
You were not able to pass a speech and swallow evaluation until 
___, and they then cleared you for pureed solids and thin 
liquids.
.
Please followup with Dr. ___ on ___ and get a CT scan of 
your head one week before this appointment. Please followup with 
your PCP, ___ one week of leaving rehab.

CXR 1 view:
SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged.
The aorta is
slightly tortuous. There is fullness of the hila bilaterally and
there is
mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Linear opacities within the
right upper
lobe may reflect scarring and chronic changes. There is likely
mild streaky
opacity in left lung base, reflective of atelectasis. No focal
consolidation,
pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is visualized. No definite
displaced rib
fractures are seen; however, the left lateral ribs are not
completely included
in the field of view.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Probable left
basilar
atelectasis and chronic changes within the right upper lobe.
Pelvis Xray - 1 view:
AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: No definite
fracture or
dislocation is present. There is diffuse demineralization of the
osseous
structures which limits the detection for subtle fractures. The
right leg is
rotated, though no distinct fracture line is visible. There are
mild
degenerative changes in both hips with joint space narrowing. No
diastasis of
the pubic symphysis or sacroiliac joints is seen. There are
diffuse vascular
calcifications. Extensive degenerative changes are noted within
the imaged
aspect of the right knee with joint space narrowing, subchondral
sclerosis and
osteophyte formation. A moderate-sized suprapatellar joint
effusion is also
noted.
IMPRESSION: Rotation of the right femur, but no definite
fracture or
dislocation. If there is continued clinical concern for an
occult fracture, a
CT is recommended for further evaluation.
Femur Xray - 2view:
AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: No definite

CT C-spine without contrast:
FINDINGS: Non-displaced fractures are present at the left
transverse
processes of T1 and T2 (601B:32). No acute vertebral body
fractures are seen.
There is a chronic wedge compression deformity of T2 (602B:36).
Severe
multilevel degenerative changes are seen throughout the cervical
spine, worst
at C3/4 and the C6/7, there is loss of intervertebral disc space
with endplate
sclerosis and subchondral cystic changes. Subluxation of
multiple facets are
compatible with severe osteoarthropathy. Included views of the
lung apices
demonstrate scarring and pleural calcifications, as seen on the
prior chest
radiograph (5:61).
IMPRESSION:
1. Non-displaced fractures of the left T1 and T2 transverse
processes.
2. Chronic wedge compression deformity at T2.
3. Severe multilevel degenerative changes throughout the
cervical spine.
CT Head noncontrast ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Numerous bifrontal and left temporal intraparenchymal
hematomas, unchanged
in appearance since the 1:01 p.m. study, with new trace
intraventricular
extension. Findings are most compatible with traumatic contusion
injuries. If
the diagnosis is in doubt and amyloid angiopathy is being
entertained as a
potential diagnosis, then MR may be of potential value in
further assessment.
2. Very small subdural hygromas, not significantly changed and
also
supporting the probability of a traumatic etiology.
Head Ct noncontrast ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bifrontal and left temporal horn parenchymal hemorrhage,
largely unchanged
in distribution compared to the prior with some likely
evolution- i.e.
slightly increased focus of hemorrhage at left frontal lobe
(2,20) and
slightly less prominent foci at the left frontal lobe at the
vertex (2,
23)when compared to the comparable level and allowing for
differences in
technique. 2. Small subdural hygromas stable.
3. Minimally increased vasogenic edema particularly at the level
of the the
left frontal lobe at the vertex (2, 23).
4. Stable layering blood in the occipital horns bilaterally.
MRI Head without contrast:
FINDINGS: Multiple foci of blood products are seen in both
frontal lobes,
left temporal lobe and intraventricular blood is also
identified. There are
bilateral small subdural collections seen extending from frontal
to the
occipital region with a maximum width of approximately 6 mm on
the left and 5
mm on the right side. There is mild indentation on the adjacent
sulci seen.
On the susceptibility images, the areas of blood products
corresponding to the
CT abnormality are identified. There are no additional foci seen
to indicate
underlying microhemorrhages.
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen. Mild changes of
small vessel
disease are noted.
IMPRESSION: Blood products in both frontal and left temporal
region likely
due to hemorrhagic contusions, although the locations of the
abnormalities are
somewhat atypical. No evidence of chronic microhemorrhages seen
in other
parts of the brain to suggest underlying abnormality. Small
bilateral
subdural collections are seen.
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Service at ___ on
___ after sustaining multiple falls with confusion. Imaging
of his head showed several areas of hemorrhage in bifrontal and
left temporal areas.
.
The patient was kept in the ICU for several days for close
observation and then transferred to the floor. He was cleared
from his c-collar medically while in the ICU. His coumadin was
held during his stay and his goal SBP was <160. Hydralazine was
given as necessary to keep within these parameters, although the
patient autoregulated well during his stay. He was started on
Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
.
The patient also had an issue with hypernatremia and was started
on normal saline at 70 cc/hr for treatment. He should get labs
daily at rehab, and may need further treamtent for his
hypernatremia.
.
One of the major issues during his stay was his mental status.
The majority of his stay he was not oriented to person, place,
or time. On discharge he is oriented to place and year.
.
He was not able to pass a speech and swallow evaluation until
___ as he would not swallow, but was cleared for pureed solids
and thin liquids with meds given crushed in puree. The patient
should be under observation when eating. This should be
re-evaluated at rehab to see if diet can be advanced.
.
Once leaving rehab, the patient will need to followup with his
PCP, ___ in reference to restarting warfarin. He was
stopped due to intracranial hemorrhages. Having atrial
fibrillation puts him at risk for embolic strokes. Since he has
a history of falls, his primary care physician should assess him
as an outpatient to evaluate the risks and benefits of
restarting coumadin. His simvastatin and lopressor doses were
not known, and he will not go to rehab on either medication. He
should followup with his PCP about restarting these medications
after rehab.
.
He will need followup with Dr. ___ on ___ and get a head
CT one week before this appointment. He will need followup with
his PCP, ___ one week of leaving rehab.

with little relief of symptoms.  Then on the day prior to 
admission he began to note ___ chest pressure on the left side. 
 He reports associted dysnpea.  He was not exerting himself due 
to generalized myalgias, but he dis not note any exertional 
component.  The pressure and dyspnea varied with possition, and 
he stated ""it was difficult to get into a comfortable position."" 
 He stated that he was only comfortable when lying on his side, 
or when propped up with 3 pillows; pain was worse when sitting

he noted nausea and vomitted x2, and has had decreased PO intake 
since ___.  He denies PND, lightheadedness, presyncope, 
syncope, and palpitiations.  
.
Because of these symptoms he presented to OSH ED.  At the OSH ED 
he was noted to have chest pressure, his troponin was elevated 
to 25.86, cK 975, MB 8.7, EKG demonstrated ___levations in 
V4, I, II, avL, and echo at OSH reportedly with mild global 
hypokinesis (45-50%), apical akinesis, and no effusion.  He was 
given vancomycin, gentamycin, fentanyl.  He was transferred to 
___ for Cardiac Cath.    
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 99.3 HR:89 BP:111/60 RR:11 
O2Sat:96%RA. Patient complaining of chest heaviness and noted to 
have a 1 cm circular abrasion on the R elbow with overlying ""red 
cellulitic area.""  He was then sent to the Cath lab for C Cath.

EKG demonstrated NSR at 86. nml axis, nml intervals.  TW 
flattening in II, III, aVF. ___levation in V2-V6.
.
C.CATH Study Date of ___:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 

demonstrated no angiographically significant coronary artery 
disease. 
2.  LV Ventriculography was deferred. 
3.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated a low central 
aortic 
pressure (87/63 mm Hg).  The right (RVEDP 9 mm Hg) and left 
(mean PCWP 
16 mm Hg) were mildly elevated.  The cardiac output / index 
measured by 
the Fick equation were preserved at 5.4 L/min and 2.64 L/min/m2. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Coronary arteries are normal. 
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top 
normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate global left 
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___ %). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
borderline dilated with borderline normal free wall function. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen 
on the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic 
valve. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: cardiomyopathy  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: ___ year-old caucasian male no significant PMH who 
presents from OSH after he presented there complaining of rash, 
fever and chest pain found to have positive biomarkers and ST 
elevations. C Cath with clean coronaries.  Most likely 
infectious mycarditis.
.  
#. CAD: No evidence of CAD on C Cath.
.  
#. Pump: EF ___ on ___ echo with global hypokinesis.  
Therefore, this is a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Due to 
history of insect bite and rash with transaminitis 
lyme/ehrlichia is of concern.  Other infections to consider 
include babesia and viral causes.  Babesia has been ruled out

rash on his Right elbow at the site of the insect bite. In
addition to myalgias he also noted headaches, left testicle
tenderness and photosensitivity. He went to an OSH ER who
diagnosed epididimitis and prescribed levoquin and discharged
him to home. Pt took 3 days of levaquin, tylenol, and ibuprofen
with little relief of symptoms. Then on the day prior to
admission he began to note ___ chest pressure on the left side. He reports associted dysnpea. He was not exerting himself due
to generalized myalgias, but he dis not note any exertional
component. The pressure and dyspnea varied with possition, and
he stated ""it was difficult to get into a comfortable position."" He stated that he was only comfortable when lying on his side,

History of Present Illness:
 Mr. ___ is a ___
generally well, very active male with a history of bicuspid
aortic valve transferred from ___ for probable
catheterization in the setting of positive stress test. He was 
in
his usual state of health until a couple weeks ago when he noted
exertional dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance during a
hockey tournament, causing him to take shorter shifts and 
recover
for longer intervals between shifts. He, in turn, presented to
his PCP ___ few days prior to transfer, who, in consultation with
his cardiologist, recommended ED evaluation that day for
expedited stress test. His troponin was elevated to 0.7 upon
arrival -> 0.6 -> 0.6. He remained asymptomatic throughout the
duration of his hospitalization. TTE demonstrated preserved 
LVEF,
though inferior hypokinesis, as well as moderate to severe 
aortic
stenosis. Nuclear ETT ultimately revealed 4 mm lateral STD and
posterolateral reversible defect. Cardiology recommended 
transfer
for catheterization.
 
At ___, initial vitals were: T 97.7, HR 55, BP 118/72,
RR 18, O2 95% RA
 
ECG: sinus bradycardia, first degree AV block, LVH pattern, TWI
in III, aVF
 
Labs/studies notable for: 
Hgb 13.4 (MCV 99.8), Cr 1.03
Trop I 0.07 -> 0.06 -> 0.06 (___)
Chol 149, HDL 49, LDL 94 
 
Patient was given: ASA 325 mg on arrival at ___ -> 81 
mg
daily thereafter.
 
Vitals prior to transfer: T 97.8, HR 55, BP 117/78, RR 18, O2 
98%
RA

On the floor, patient corroborated above history. He adds that
his first indication that something was awry dates back to
___, when he noted it was ""hard to catch his breath"" during
his first few hockey games of the season. He detected 
improvement
after four or five games, so attributed it to ""being out of
shape."" He felt well in the interim, participating in golf,
tennis, and conditioning/light weights at the gym. It was then a
couple weeks ago that he again noted shortness of breath during 
a
hockey tournament. On ___, he ""almost fainted"" while skating. 
He
has never experienced chest pain. He likewise denies fevers,
diaphoresis, syncope, vision changes, palpitations, orthopnea,
PND, lower extremity swelling, gastrointestinal symptoms, or
viral-like illness. He can otherwise walk any distance or climb
stairs without issue.  He was evaluated by Cardiac surgery after 
LHC and was deemed appropriate for CABG/AVR.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent  CABG x2 (SVG-PDA, SVG-OM2), AVR tissue 
(25mm Magna Ease).  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure 
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  

 POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery. The patient developed post-operative atrial 
fibrillation that corrected with amiodarone. The duration of the 
AF was short and he will not require anticoagulation at 
discharge. He will be discharged on the typical 1 month course 
of amiodarone. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical 
Therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. On 
POD 4 the patient had a self-limiting episode of diplopia. The 
patient states he had no other symptoms and his diplopia 
resolved in 15 seconds. The patient had no further episodes and 
no further work up was indicated given the short duration of his 
symptoms.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was 
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in 
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___
generally well, very active male with a history of bicuspid
aortic valve transferred from ___ for probable
catheterization in the setting of positive stress test. He was
in
his usual state of health until a couple weeks ago when he noted
exertional dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance during a
hockey tournament, causing him to take shorter shifts and
recover
for longer intervals between shifts. He, in turn, presented to
his PCP ___ few days prior to transfer, who, in consultation with
his cardiologist, recommended ED evaluation that day for
expedited stress test. His troponin was elevated to 0.7 upon
arrival -> 0.6 -> 0.6. He remained asymptomatic throughout the
duration of his hospitalization. TTE demonstrated preserved
LVEF,
though inferior hypokinesis, as well as moderate to severe
aortic
stenosis. Nuclear ETT ultimately revealed 4 mm lateral STD and
posterolateral reversible defect. Cardiology recommended
transfer
for catheterization.
At ___, initial vitals were: T 97.7, HR 55, BP 118/72,
RR 18, O2 95% RA
ECG: sinus bradycardia, first degree AV block, LVH pattern, TWI
in III, aVF
Labs/studies notable for:
Hgb 13.4 (MCV 99.8), Cr 1.03
Trop I 0.07 -> 0.06 -> 0.06 (___)
Chol 149, HDL 49, LDL 94
Patient was given: ASA 325 mg on arrival at ___ -> 81
mg
daily thereafter.
Vitals prior to transfer: T 97.8, HR 55, BP 117/78, RR 18, O2
98%
RA
On the floor, patient corroborated above history. He adds that
his first indication that something was awry dates back to
___, when he noted it was ""hard to catch his breath"" during
his first few hockey games of the season. He detected
improvement
after four or five games, so attributed it to ""being out of
shape."" He felt well in the interim, participating in golf,
tennis, and conditioning/light weights at the gym. It was then a
couple weeks ago that he again noted shortness of breath during
a
hockey tournament. On ___, he ""almost fainted"" while skating.
He
has never experienced chest pain. He likewise denies fevers,
diaphoresis, syncope, vision changes, palpitations, orthopnea,
PND, lower extremity swelling, gastrointestinal symptoms, or
viral-like illness. He can otherwise walk any distance or climb
stairs without issue. He was evaluated by Cardiac surgery after
LHC and was deemed appropriate for CABG/AVR.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where
the patient underwent CABG x2 (SVG-PDA, SVG-OM2), AVR tissue
(25mm Magna Ease). Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. The patient developed post-operative atrial
fibrillation that corrected with amiodarone. The duration of the
AF was short and he will not require anticoagulation at
discharge. He will be discharged on the typical 1 month course
of amiodarone. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication. The patient was evaluated by the Physical
Therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. On
POD 4 the patient had a self-limiting episode of diplopia. The
patient states he had no other symptoms and his diplopia
resolved in 15 seconds. The patient had no further episodes and
no further work up was indicated given the short duration of his
symptoms. By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged to home in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery 
disease s/p MI, and prostate cancer s/p XRT complicated by 
radiation proctitis was admitted with chest pain and 
hematochezia. 

1. Hematochezia
Patient appears to have had acute blood loss anemia in the 
setting of rectal bleeding related to radiation proctitis. 
Patient and family were not interested in further 
gastroenterology evaluation with colonoscopy as patient has 
undergone ineffective cautery in the past. Patient was 
transfused 2 units pRBCs with an appropriate improvement in his 
hematocrit from 23 to 31. He had no further episodes of bleeding 
as an outpatient. 

2. NSTEMI
Patient appears to have had an acute GI bleed ___ days prior to 
admission at which time he experienced chest pain. This likely 
represented an MI in the setting of demand ischemia. His cardiac 
enzymes were elevated on presentation and then declined during 
his admission. His aspirin was held during this admission due to 
the GI bleeding. Likewise, lisinopril and metoprolol were also 
held in the setting of hypotension with systolic blood pressures 
primarily in the ___. He was recommended to have these 
medications restarted as an outpatient. His simvastatin was 
increased to 80mg from 20mg in the setting of his NSTEMI. 

3. Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Systolic Heart Failure
Shortly after receiving 2 units of pRBCs for his GI bleeding, he 
developed an oxygen requirement after being found to be 89% on 
room air. As his blood pressure allowed, he was gently diuresed 
with lasix and then restarted on his home dose of lasix. He was 
stable on room air upon discharge from the hospital. As 
described below, his ACEI and beta blocker were held during this 
admission due to hypotension. These should be restarted as an 
outpatient as blood pressure allows. 

4. Hypotension
Shortly after arriving to the floor, patient triggered with 
hypotension with systolic blood pressure of 80. His blood 
pressure improved with transfusions and holding his home 
medications of lisinopril and metoprolol. These should be 
restarted as an outpatient as blood pressure allows. 

His code status was confirmed to be DNR/DNI with patient's 
daughter.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of your bleeding 
and low blood count. Your bleeding is most likely related to 
complications and side effects from your radiation therapy. You 
also likely had a heart attack due to the stress on your heart. 

Please continue to take all of your medications. We have made 
the following changes to your medications: 
- Lisinopril - We have discontinued this medication because your 
blood pressure was slightly low. 
- Metoprolol - We have discontinued this medication because your 
blood pressure was slightly low. 
- Aspirin - We have discontinued this medication due to your 
bleeding. 
- Simvastatin - We have increased this medication from 20mg to 
80mg once daily. 

Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop fevers, 
shaking chills, night sweats, bleeding from your bottom, nausea, 
vomiting, bloody vomitus, shortness of breath, or chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery
disease s/p MI, and prostate cancer s/p XRT complicated by
radiation proctitis was admitted with chest pain and
hematochezia.
1. Hematochezia
Patient appears to have had acute blood loss anemia in the
setting of rectal bleeding related to radiation proctitis.
Patient and family were not interested in further
gastroenterology evaluation with colonoscopy as patient has
undergone ineffective cautery in the past. Patient was
transfused 2 units pRBCs with an appropriate improvement in his
hematocrit from 23 to 31. He had no further episodes of bleeding
as an outpatient.
2. NSTEMI
Patient appears to have had an acute GI bleed ___ days prior to
admission at which time he experienced chest pain. This likely
represented an MI in the setting of demand ischemia. His cardiac
enzymes were elevated on presentation and then declined during
his admission. His aspirin was held during this admission due to
the GI bleeding. Likewise, lisinopril and metoprolol were also
held in the setting of hypotension with systolic blood pressures
primarily in the ___. He was recommended to have these
medications restarted as an outpatient. His simvastatin was
increased to 80mg from 20mg in the setting of his NSTEMI.
3. Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Systolic Heart Failure
Shortly after receiving 2 units of pRBCs for his GI bleeding, he
developed an oxygen requirement after being found to be 89% on
room air. As his blood pressure allowed, he was gently diuresed
with lasix and then restarted on his home dose of lasix. He was
stable on room air upon discharge from the hospital. As
described below, his ACEI and beta blocker were held during this
admission due to hypotension. These should be restarted as an
outpatient as blood pressure allows.
4. Hypotension
Shortly after arriving to the floor, patient triggered with
hypotension with systolic blood pressure of 80. His blood
pressure improved with transfusions and holding his home
medications of lisinopril and metoprolol. These should be
restarted as an outpatient as blood pressure allows.
His code status was confirmed to be DNR/DNI with patient's
daughter.

#Pyschosis:
Patient presented with flat affect, severe paranoia, 
disorganized thought process, and possible catatonia. Patient 
was very reluctant to speak to staff, but would intermittently 
talk to staff. Patient was started on Lorazepam 2mg TID for 
catatonia but refused to take them. After further evaluation,

stopped and she was started on Zyprexa Zydis 10mg BID with 
Zyprexa Zydis 5mg BID:PRN. Patient initially refused these. On 
the night of ___, patient attempted to elope and became very 
agitated and assaultive towards staff and had to be put in 
seclusion for safety of self and concern for safety for staff. 
Patient was then started on Zyprexa 10mg IM.  However, she did 
not respond well to this and was violent to staff on multiple 
occasions.  She was transitioned to thorazine standing.  This 
was too sedating and she was then transitioned to haldol with 
intermittent ativan prn agitation. After the ___ was granted on 
___, patient was started on Haldol Deconoate IM with Haldol PO 
as a bridge and tolerated it well. Patient was also only 
intermittently eating and there was a concern for her medical 
health due to malnutrition. Patient was able to be reassured 
that eating was beneficial to her and started eating again. 
Patient started to improve on haldol evidenced by lessening 
paranoia, becoming more visible in the milieu and interacting 
with other patients and her family. Patient was given a series 
of 2 Haldol Deconoate 100mg IM shots and a ___ shot of 75mg 
Haldol deconoate and tolerated them well without side effects. 
Patient was also titrated off Oral Haldol by discharge and was 
only requiring 75mg Haldol Deconoate IM every 2 weeks.  Patient 
was also put on Cogentin 1mg BID to prevent EPS and has 
tolerated it well. Patient was discharged on Cogentin 1mg BID as 
well.

consistently. She was started on Nadolol 20mg BID which she 
tolerated well. Patient's HR was in ___'s towards end of stay and 
did not require nadolol anymore.  

PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:
- Patient on admission was extremely isolative and remained in 
her room, covered in her hood, coat and blankets. She would 
intermittently come to day room but would not interact with any 
of the milieu. Patient did not attend any groups at first. After 
receiving medications patient became more visible in milieu. 
Patient also started to attend groups. At first she was non 
participatory but became much more interactive in groups and 
fully participating in most groups. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS:
- Sister: ___ Patient's sister ___ was very 
involved in her care and provided insight into patient's past 
presentation to ___. Patient's sister also had 
family meetings with team to provide insight into living 
situation and aftercare planning.

She was involved in family meetings and coordination of care 
after discharge. 

#) INTERVENTIONS:
___ Referral:  The team submitted a ___ application for the 
patient to receive services, specifically requesting case 
management, outpatient treators and ___ services.

INFORMED CONSENT:
The team discussed the indications for, intended benefits of,  
and possible side effects and risks of starting this medication, 
and risks  and benefits of possible alternatives, including not 
taking the medication, with this patient.   We discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to  take this medication as 
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment and discussing any  questions about medications 
with the treatment team, and I  answered the patient's 
questions.  The patient appeared able to understand and 
consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT:

#) Chronic/Static Risk Factors:
-Long standing mental illness
- 

#) Modifiable Risk Factors:
-Medication non compliance
-Acute decompensation of mental illness
- No current outpatient providers

#) Protective Factors:
- Strong family support

PROGNOSIS:
Fair: Patient has a potential to do well in the future if she 
continues to be compliant with her medications. She also has 
strong family support and has had previous volunteer/work 
experience to possibly fall back on. Patient is still ambivalent 
about medications/mental illness so she has potential to stop 
taking her medications.

PSYCHIATRIC:
#Pyschosis:
Patient presented with flat affect, severe paranoia,
disorganized thought process, and possible catatonia. Patient
was very reluctant to speak to staff, but would intermittently
talk to staff. Patient was started on Lorazepam 2mg TID for
catatonia but refused to take them. After further evaluation,
she was determined not to be catatonic and the lorazepam was
stopped and she was started on Zyprexa Zydis 10mg BID with
Zyprexa Zydis 5mg BID:PRN. Patient initially refused these. On
the night of ___, patient attempted to elope and became very
agitated and assaultive towards staff and had to be put in
seclusion for safety of self and concern for safety for staff.
Patient was then started on Zyprexa 10mg IM. However, she did
not respond well to this and was violent to staff on multiple
occasions. She was transitioned to thorazine standing. This
was too sedating and she was then transitioned to haldol with
intermittent ativan prn agitation. After the ___ was granted on
___, patient was started on Haldol Deconoate IM with Haldol PO
as a bridge and tolerated it well. Patient was also only
intermittently eating and there was a concern for her medical
health due to malnutrition. Patient was able to be reassured
that eating was beneficial to her and started eating again.
Patient started to improve on haldol evidenced by lessening
paranoia, becoming more visible in the milieu and interacting
with other patients and her family. Patient was given a series
of 2 Haldol Deconoate 100mg IM shots and a ___ shot of 75mg
Haldol deconoate and tolerated them well without side effects.
Patient was also titrated off Oral Haldol by discharge and was
only requiring 75mg Haldol Deconoate IM every 2 weeks. Patient
was also put on Cogentin 1mg BID to prevent EPS and has
tolerated it well. Patient was discharged on Cogentin 1mg BID as
well.
GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
#) Diabetes: Patient was placed on Fingersticks QID, but early
on in admission would refuse them. There was no episodes of
hypo/hyperglycemia.
#)Tachycardia: Patient was noticed to be hypertensive during her
stay on the unit. Her heart rate would reach up to 110's
consistently. She was started on Nadolol 20mg BID which she
tolerated well. Patient's HR was in ___'s towards end of stay and
did not require nadolol anymore.
PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:
- Patient on admission was extremely isolative and remained in
her room, covered in her hood, coat and blankets. She would
intermittently come to day room but would not interact with any
of the milieu. Patient did not attend any groups at first. After
receiving medications patient became more visible in milieu.
Patient also started to attend groups. At first she was non
participatory but became much more interactive in groups and
fully participating in most groups.
#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS:
- Sister: ___ Patient's sister ___ was very
involved in her care and provided insight into patient's past
presentation to ___. Patient's sister also had
family meetings with team to provide insight into living
situation and aftercare planning.
#) FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
Sister: ___ Patient's sister ___ were
involved in patient' care and were great advocates. Patient's
sisters were very concerned about patient being discharged too
early especially after what happened to previous admission at
___. Patient's sisters came and visited which went well.
She was involved in family meetings and coordination of care
after discharge.
#) INTERVENTIONS:
___ Referral: The team submitted a ___ application for the
patient to receive services, specifically requesting case
management, outpatient treators and ___ services.
INFORMED CONSENT:
The team discussed the indications for, intended benefits of,
and possible side effects and risks of starting this medication,
and risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not
taking the medication, with this patient. We discussed the
patient's right to decide whether to take this medication as
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating
in the treatment and discussing any questions about medications
with the treatment team, and I answered the patient's
questions. The patient appeared able to understand and
consented to begin the medication.
RISK ASSESSMENT:
#) Chronic/Static Risk Factors:
-Long standing mental illness
-
#) Modifiable Risk Factors:
-Medication non compliance
-Acute decompensation of mental illness
- No current outpatient providers
#) Protective Factors:
- Strong family support
PROGNOSIS:
Fair: Patient has a potential to do well in the future if she
continues to be compliant with her medications. She also has
strong family support and has had previous volunteer/work
experience to possibly fall back on. Patient is still ambivalent
about medications/mental illness so she has potential to stop
taking her medications.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with Hx of IBS, Diverticulosis, and CAD, 
presenting with 5 days of watery diarrhea and found to have 
guaiac + stools with 5 pt Hct drop
.
# Normocytic Anemia: Patient had 5 pt Hct drop on labs from the 
ED. In setting of guaiac + stools, this was concerning for a GI 
source of acute blood loss. She has known diverticulosis and 
hemorrhoids, and was currently experiencing diarrhea. She denied 
black stools and had none during this admission. She declined NG 
lavage in the ED, and declined any additional inpatient 
procedures to further investigate a potential GI source of blood 
loss. We maintained an active T&S and two large-bore peripheral 
IVs for access. She was monitored on telemetry and her vitals 
remained hemodynamically stable. Her repeat hematocrit was also 
stable. Given the low suspicion of an acute large-volume GI 
bleed, the patient was discharged home with instructions to 
follow up with her Gastroenterologist, Dr. ___ was also in 
agreement with this plan. It is more likely that she presented 
with an elevated hematocrit secondary to hemoconcentration in 
the setting of diarrhea, which fell by 5 pts after rehydration.
.  
# Diarrhea: In setting of chills, weakness, and a recent 
laryngitis, her diarrhea was likely infectious in etiology. 
Given lack of fever or leukocytosis, a viral etiology was 
suspected over an acute bacterial infection. She denied recent 
antibiotic use and had only one episode of vomiting. Stool 
studies were sent and most are still pending. These will need to 
be followed up by her Gastroenterologist. No abdominal imaging 
was performed; however, her exam was reassuring with no 
tenderness to palpation, rebound, or guarding. Given the low 
likelihood of a bacterial infection with toxin production, she 
was given Loperamide to take to as needed to control her 
diarrhea. She was additionally given IV hydration and her 
electrolytes were repleted as needed. 
.
# Hypokalemia: Likely secondary to diarrhea. Repleted as needed. 

.  
# Coronary Artery Disease: Has a history of a myocardial 
infarction in ___ without any further events. Denies stent 
placement. Presented on Aspirin 81 and ___ 75 mg daily. After 
discussion with her Primary Care Physician, ___ was held at 
discharge given no clear current indication and possible 
near-future procedure (colonoscopy).

Brief Hospital Course:
He was initially admitted to the medicine service and his care 
was transferred to the Acute Care Surgery team for further 
management of his ___ abscess. 

His presentation of right buttock erythema with overlying 
warmth, fevers/chills, and lack of fluctuance or fluid 
collection on CT was initially concerning for a superficial 
infection, most likely cellulitis given his recent history of 
picking at the area with his fingers. Initially, there was no 
clear sign of abscess or inflamed fistula on CT.  He was started 
on IV vancomycin 1.2 g Q12h for gram positive coverage (day 1 
___, and received IV Dilaudid for pain control.  Surgery 
consult on the first day of admission concluded low suspicion 
for abscess at the time.  Later that afternoon, however, patient 
continued to have fevers (Tmax 103) despite receiving vancomycin 
and Tylenol.  He received IVF NS boluses for SBP to 100s and HR 
to 100s-120s.  MRI pelvis was again equivocal.  The next morning 
he complained of new bilateral scrotal swelling and erythema,

Brief Hospital Course:
He was initially admitted to the medicine service and his care
was transferred to the Acute Care Surgery team for further
management of his ___ abscess.
His presentation of right buttock erythema with overlying
warmth, fevers/chills, and lack of fluctuance or fluid
collection on CT was initially concerning for a superficial
infection, most likely cellulitis given his recent history of
picking at the area with his fingers. Initially, there was no
clear sign of abscess or inflamed fistula on CT. He was started
on IV vancomycin 1.2 g Q12h for gram positive coverage (day 1
___, and received IV Dilaudid for pain control. Surgery
consult on the first day of admission concluded low suspicion
for abscess at the time. Later that afternoon, however, patient
continued to have fevers (Tmax 103) despite receiving vancomycin
and Tylenol. He received IVF NS boluses for SBP to 100s and HR
to 100s-120s. MRI pelvis was again equivocal. The next morning
he complained of new bilateral scrotal swelling and erythema,
with dysuria that was concerning for postrenal/obstructive
symptoms. He was then taken to OR for surgical incision and
drainage of a ___ abscess.
Postoperatively he was continued on the IV antibiotics and on
POD #2 ___ baths were ordered. His ___ was left for another
couple of days and then removed. His pain persisted
postoperatively along with increasing in erythema and he was
taken back to the operating room on ___ and ___ for
further irrigation and debridement. Both his pain and erythema
diminished significantly although he was still requiring
narcotics for pain control. ___ baths and BID dressing changes
were resumed.
He did have significant pain control issues requiring several
adjustments of his pain regimen. At time of discharge he is on
an oral regimen which includes both long and short acting
narcotics with adequate control. A bowel regimen was initiated
early on as well.
His antibiotics were stopped and his WBC and temperature were
followed closely 48 hours after stopping therapy. Both his white

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Bradycardia - pt has known AFib, rhythm-controlled on 
Diltiazem and Norpace since ___. Bradycardia likely ___ 
nodal-blocking properties of these meds in the setting of 
underlying conduction disease. Pt was given Atropine x2 and 
Calcium; BP and HR increased in response. Pt converted to sinus 
rhythm in the ED. Per discussion with patient and daughter, 
prefers medication management and refuses PPM at this time. A 
TTE was obtained and showed normal ventricular systolic 
function, moderate aortic valve stenosis and regurgitation, mild 
pulmonary HTN, and mild post-stenotic dilation of the ascending 
aorta. We have stopped her home Norpace 100mg TID and Diltiazem 
120mg BID. We have started her on Norpace CR 100mg BID for 
rhythm control. No other medication changes were made. She 
should continue home ASA. Of note, she was noted to have high 
TSH (7.9) and normal free T4 (1.1). TSH elevation likely to 
non-thyroid processes in the setting of bradycardia and 
conduction abnormalities. Recommend re-checking TSH in ___ 
to rule out hypothyroidism. 
.
#. HTN - on presentation, pt was found to be hypotensive w/ SBP 
of 80-90s. Home Diltiazem was stopped, pt was given IV Fluids. 
BP improved overnight and pt was found to be hypertensive 
(150-170s/40-60s) on day of discharge. No antihypertensive 
medications were started to avoid dysrymias and worsening 
conduction abnormalities. We recommend that the subject of HTN 
be revisited on her ___ appt with PCP or ___ as she might 
benefit from ACE-inhibitor for pressure control. Would recommend 
avoiding any nodal blocking agents given underlying conduction 
disease. 
.  
# Delirium - on presentation to the floor, pt was noted to be 
disoriented and delirious likely ___ medications (?Atropine). 
Mental status markedly improved within ___ hours. on 
discharge, pt was AOx3 and close to her baseline.
.  
# Vertigo/Emesis - Pt developed spells of vertigo and/or 
sensation of falling down; additionally, she had two episodes of 
emesis, associated w/ vertigo. These symptoms, too, were ikely a 
side effect of Atropine. Pt given Zofran and IV Fluids w/ 
complete relief. On discharge, denies nausea, dizziness, 
vertigo.   
.  
# Acute renal failure: On initial labs, it was noted that pt's 
creatinine was 1.2. Unknown baseline. Possibly from either 
dehydration or from poor forward flow in the setting of brief

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Bradycardia - pt has known AFib, rhythm-controlled on
Diltiazem and Norpace since ___. Bradycardia likely ___
nodal-blocking properties of these meds in the setting of
underlying conduction disease. Pt was given Atropine x2 and
Calcium; BP and HR increased in response. Pt converted to sinus
rhythm in the ED. Per discussion with patient and daughter,
prefers medication management and refuses PPM at this time. A
TTE was obtained and showed normal ventricular systolic
function, moderate aortic valve stenosis and regurgitation, mild
pulmonary HTN, and mild post-stenotic dilation of the ascending
aorta. We have stopped her home Norpace 100mg TID and Diltiazem
120mg BID. We have started her on Norpace CR 100mg BID for
rhythm control. No other medication changes were made. She
should continue home ASA. Of note, she was noted to have high
TSH (7.9) and normal free T4 (1.1). TSH elevation likely to
non-thyroid processes in the setting of bradycardia and
conduction abnormalities. Recommend re-checking TSH in ___
to rule out hypothyroidism.
.
#. HTN - on presentation, pt was found to be hypotensive w/ SBP
of 80-90s. Home Diltiazem was stopped, pt was given IV Fluids.
BP improved overnight and pt was found to be hypertensive
(150-170s/40-60s) on day of discharge. No antihypertensive
medications were started to avoid dysrymias and worsening
conduction abnormalities. We recommend that the subject of HTN
be revisited on her ___ appt with PCP or ___ as she might
benefit from ACE-inhibitor for pressure control. Would recommend
avoiding any nodal blocking agents given underlying conduction
disease.
.
# Delirium - on presentation to the floor, pt was noted to be
disoriented and delirious likely ___ medications (?Atropine).
Mental status markedly improved within ___ hours. on
discharge, pt was AOx3 and close to her baseline.
.
# Vertigo/Emesis - Pt developed spells of vertigo and/or
sensation of falling down; additionally, she had two episodes of
emesis, associated w/ vertigo. These symptoms, too, were ikely a
side effect of Atropine. Pt given Zofran and IV Fluids w/
complete relief. On discharge, denies nausea, dizziness,
vertigo.
.
# Acute renal failure: On initial labs, it was noted that pt's
creatinine was 1.2. Unknown baseline. Possibly from either
dehydration or from poor forward flow in the setting of brief
episodes of hypotension. Pt was given IV Fluids. Creatinine
improved to .8 on day of discharge.
.
#. Coagulopathy: INR 1.4. Likely from nutritional status.
Recommend re-checking on PCP ___.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ PMH HTN, asplenia, SVT s/p ablation who 
presents as a transfer from ___ after a smear 
was concerning for babesiosis. He says the current presentation 
started 3 weeks ago. He first noticed he wasn't feeling well 
when he ate a burger at Five Guys with some friends and it felt 
like it took 2d to digest. He then developed a cough so a friend 
prescribed him a Z-pack. His symptoms did not resolve and he 
started developing fevers ranging from 100.4 to 103.3. He was 
also having such severe chills that at times he had to shut the 
AC off and turned the heat up to ___. 2d ago he presented to his 
PCP for the persistent cough and was prescribed Levofloxacin, 
and was told that if his symptoms did not improve by ___ 
he should get a CXR. The night prior to presentation he had 
drenching night sweats so he came to the ___ ED.  
 In the ___ ED he was found to be hyponatremic (128) 
with smear concerning for intracellular parasites so he was seen 
by ID. Parasite count and legionella antigen from OSH are 
pending. He was given CTX, atovaquone, and doxycycline. 
Initially he was afebrile on arrival but then spiked a fever to 
103.0 and was given APAP. He was also desaturating and requiring 
2L O2. He was transferred to ___ for concern for babesiosis.  
 Of note, he says he has had 4 tick bites this year, most 
recently at the end of ___. His most recent travel was to 
___ in ___. His mother recently had pneumonia but other 
than that he is not aware of any sick contacts. Other than his 
cough, fevers, and chills he denies CP, SOB, N/V/D, abdominal 
pain.  
 In the ED, initial VS were 98.9 95 134/93 18 95% Nasal Cannula. 
His exam was unremarkable. His labs were notable for 
hyponatremia (130), LDH 459, Hgb 11.6, plt 101. CXR showed a RLL 
consolidation with trace bilateral pleural effusions. He was not 
given any more medications in our ED.  
 Transfer VS were 99.3PO 145 / 83 92 20 94 RA  
 On arrival to the floor, patient reports that he is feeling ok. 
He is having a persistent cough. Upon arrival he was given 500mg 
Azithromycin for treatment of babesiosis as he had not yet 
received this.

HOSPITAL COURSE
===============
Mr. ___ is a ___ PMH HTN, asplenia, SVT s/p ablation who 
presents as a transfer from ___ after a smear 
was concerning for babesiosis. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Lyme 
# Babesiosis: Given asplenia at greater risk for severe 
infection, but at the time of admission his parasite load on the 
parasite smear was only 1.8% (___) to 2.1% (___), did not have 
elevated alkaline phosphatase, and was < ___ y/o, which puts him 
at lower risk for fulminant disease. Decreased to 0.5% on ___. 
Fever curve trending down and clinically stable. Seen by ID who 
approved antibiotic course. Will continue azithromycin 250mg PO 
Q24 and atovaquone 750mg PO BID for babesia for planned 6 week 
course (last day ___. Will take doxycycline 100mg PO BID x 
14 days for Lyme (last day ___. PCP to please follow 
anaplasma and borrelia serologies still pending at ___ 
___.

# RLL infiltrate: 
# Cough: Patient has a persistent cough with RLL consolidation 
and pleural effusion. This may represent pneumonia or 
infiltrate/ARDS with babesiosis, but does not clinically appear 
to have ARDS. At ___ legionella antigen was sent because of RLL 
infiltrate and concomitant hyponatremia. Negative strep pneumo 
antigen and legionella at ___. Was treated with CTX from ___ to 
___, but due to low concern for CAP was discontinued and 
discharged on antibiotics as above. 

# Anemia: Babesiosis is often accompanied by hemolytic anemia 
and thrombocytopenia. This is most likely hemolytic anemia as a 
result of his babesiosis given his elevated LDH. DIC was also on 
the differential but his fibrinogen was normal. Unclear 
baseline.

# Asplenia: Although most likely source of his sepsis is 
babesiosis, he is at risk for bacterial pathogens as well. 
Provided with Augmentin for pill-in-pocket empiric therapy and 
instructions to see PCP for vaccinations.

# Hyponatremia: UOSm is 310 and UNa < 20, most likely 
hypovolemic hyponatremia from fevers with drenching night 
sweats. Resolved with IV fluids.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# HTN: Continued home losartan and metoprolol. 

# Alcohol use: He reported drinking 4 drinks per night at home, 
but has not had a drink in 1 week because of feeling ill. As his 
last drink was 1 week ago, he was out of the normal window for 
alcohol withdrawal symptoms so he was not put on a CIWA scale. 
AST elevated. Should have LFTs rechecked and alcohol counseling 
from PCP.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] New medications
- Atovaquone Suspension 750 mg PO/NG BID x 6 weeks (last day 
___
- Azithromycin 250 mg PO/NG Q24H x 6 weeks (last day ___ 
- Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg PO Q12H x 2 weeks (last day ___ 

- Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid ___ mg PO PRN fever over 100.4 or 
shaking chills 
[] Due to asplenia, provided with pill in pocket (Augmentin) if 
patient has fevers > 100.4 at home
[] PCP to ensure patient up to date on vaccinations below
- Influenza

[] PCP to check repeat CBC and parasite smear to ensure 
infection resolved, refer to ID if still parasitemia (discharge 
1.1% parasitemia)
[] Elevated AST and reported 4+ drinks per night, PCP to recheck 
LFTs and counsel patient on EtOH use
[] Recommend PCP conduct outpatient repeat CXR to ensure 
resolution of infiltrate versus need for CT imaging

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were transferred to ___ with concern for a 
babesia infection. You were also found to have Lyme disease. 
This was causing fever, sweating, and cough.

You were seen here by our infectious disease specialists. You 
were started on several strong antibiotics that you will 
continue taking for several weeks. 

Because you don't have a spleen, you are at higher risk for 
infection. You should see your PCP for vaccinations to make sure 
you're up to date. If you EVER develop a fever over 100.4 or 
severe shaking chills, you should take an antibiotic pill 
(Augmentin) and see your doctor as soon as possible. We also 
recommend that you wear a medical alert bracelet explaining your 
asplenia.

When you see your PCP on ___, they should check some blood 
work to ensure the infection is controlled.

It was a privilege to care for you in the hospital, and we wish 
you all the best.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Health Team

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ PMH HTN, asplenia, SVT s/p ablation who
presents as a transfer from ___ after a smear
was concerning for babesiosis. He says the current presentation
started 3 weeks ago. He first noticed he wasn't feeling well
when he ate a burger at Five Guys with some friends and it felt
like it took 2d to digest. He then developed a cough so a friend
prescribed him a Z-pack. His symptoms did not resolve and he
started developing fevers ranging from 100.4 to 103.3. He was
also having such severe chills that at times he had to shut the
AC off and turned the heat up to ___. 2d ago he presented to his
PCP for the persistent cough and was prescribed Levofloxacin,
and was told that if his symptoms did not improve by ___
he should get a CXR. The night prior to presentation he had
drenching night sweats so he came to the ___ ED. In the ___ ED he was found to be hyponatremic (128)
with smear concerning for intracellular parasites so he was seen
by ID. Parasite count and legionella antigen from OSH are
pending. He was given CTX, atovaquone, and doxycycline.
Initially he was afebrile on arrival but then spiked a fever to
103.0 and was given APAP. He was also desaturating and requiring
2L O2. He was transferred to ___ for concern for babesiosis. Of note, he says he has had 4 tick bites this year, most
recently at the end of ___. His most recent travel was to
___ in ___. His mother recently had pneumonia but other
than that he is not aware of any sick contacts. Other than his
cough, fevers, and chills he denies CP, SOB, N/V/D, abdominal
pain. In the ED, initial VS were 98.9 95 134/93 18 95% Nasal Cannula.
His exam was unremarkable. His labs were notable for
hyponatremia (130), LDH 459, Hgb 11.6, plt 101. CXR showed a RLL
consolidation with trace bilateral pleural effusions. He was not
given any more medications in our ED. Transfer VS were 99.3PO 145 / 83 92 20 94 RA On arrival to the floor, patient reports that he is feeling ok.
He is having a persistent cough. Upon arrival he was given 500mg
Azithromycin for treatment of babesiosis as he had not yet
received this.

HOSPITAL COURSE
===============
Mr. ___ is a ___ PMH HTN, asplenia, SVT s/p ablation who
presents as a transfer from ___ after a smear
was concerning for babesiosis.
ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Lyme
# Babesiosis: Given asplenia at greater risk for severe
infection, but at the time of admission his parasite load on the
parasite smear was only 1.8% (___) to 2.1% (___), did not have
elevated alkaline phosphatase, and was < ___ y/o, which puts him
at lower risk for fulminant disease. Decreased to 0.5% on ___.
Fever curve trending down and clinically stable. Seen by ID who
approved antibiotic course. Will continue azithromycin 250mg PO
Q24 and atovaquone 750mg PO BID for babesia for planned 6 week
course (last day ___. Will take doxycycline 100mg PO BID x
14 days for Lyme (last day ___. PCP to please follow
anaplasma and borrelia serologies still pending at ___
___.
# RLL infiltrate:
# Cough: Patient has a persistent cough with RLL consolidation
and pleural effusion. This may represent pneumonia or
infiltrate/ARDS with babesiosis, but does not clinically appear
to have ARDS. At ___ legionella antigen was sent because of RLL
infiltrate and concomitant hyponatremia. Negative strep pneumo
antigen and legionella at ___. Was treated with CTX from ___ to
___, but due to low concern for CAP was discontinued and
discharged on antibiotics as above.
# Anemia: Babesiosis is often accompanied by hemolytic anemia
and thrombocytopenia. This is most likely hemolytic anemia as a
result of his babesiosis given his elevated LDH. DIC was also on
the differential but his fibrinogen was normal. Unclear
baseline.
# Asplenia: Although most likely source of his sepsis is
babesiosis, he is at risk for bacterial pathogens as well.
Provided with Augmentin for pill-in-pocket empiric therapy and
instructions to see PCP for vaccinations.
# Hyponatremia: UOSm is 310 and UNa < 20, most likely
hypovolemic hyponatremia from fevers with drenching night
sweats. Resolved with IV fluids.
CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# HTN: Continued home losartan and metoprolol.
# Alcohol use: He reported drinking 4 drinks per night at home,
but has not had a drink in 1 week because of feeling ill. As his
last drink was 1 week ago, he was out of the normal window for
alcohol withdrawal symptoms so he was not put on a CIWA scale.
AST elevated. Should have LFTs rechecked and alcohol counseling
from PCP.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================

infection resolved, refer to ID if still parasitemia (discharge
1.1% parasitemia)
[] Elevated AST and reported 4+ drinks per night, PCP to recheck
LFTs and counsel patient on EtOH use
[] Recommend PCP conduct outpatient repeat CXR to ensure
resolution of infiltrate versus need for CT imaging

IMAGING:
CT CODE STROKE PROTOCOL (CT, CTA, CTP)
No hemorrhage, and no definite CT evidence of acute vascular 
territory infarct. Extensive white matter hypodensity likely 
reflects 
sequelae of chronic small vessel disease, but also makes it 
difficult to rule out small acute lacune. Ventricular and sulcal 
prominence is most consistent with atrophy 

MRI 
acute infarct ___ the right medulla . multiple punctate areas of 
susceptibility artifact on GRE, most consistent with amyloid 
angiopathy. 
other findings consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic 
changes and prior infarcts. 

TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 
80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. There are focal calcifications ___ the aortic arch. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting 
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There 
is no pericardial effusion.

REPEAT CT ___ ___:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 
Right 
hypodensity ___ the medulla (2:7) is progressed from the 
comparison study dated 
___, representing evolution of the known infarction ___ 
that 
location. Note is made of periventricular white matter hypodense 
areas which 
are bilateral, reflecting chronic microvascular infarction. 
Ventriclar and 
sulcal enlargement signifies parenchymal volume loss. There is 
no fracture.  
Fluid ___ the mastoid air cells on the left, is new from 
___ as is fluid 
layering ___ the nasopharynx and a small air-fluid level seen ___ 
the sphenoid 
sinus. Marked atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo LHW with h/o HTN and prior CVA with residual left sided 
weakness presents with acute right facial droop, N/V and 
nystagmus.

NEURO:
Patient presented to ED and code stroke called. NIHSS was 6, 
however 3 points were from prior CVA. This was considered a low 
score and t-PA was not indicated. CT, CTA and CTP showed no 
acute abnormalities, only evidence of old lacunar infarcts and 
atrophy. Patient's neurologic exam was significant for 
dysarthria, right facial droop, left gaze preference with 
inability to cross midline toward right side, with nystagmus on 
attempts to look right, left sided hemiparesis and hemisensory 
loss. She was also profusely vomiting despite receiving Zofran. 
Given multiple cranial nerve involvement, localization was 
thought to be brainstem, specifically pons. 
BP was allowed to autoregulate, and patient was started on ASA 
325mg. Home dose of statin was increased, and atenolol was 
halved during acute period. 
MRI showed a right lateral medullary/pontine-meduallary junction 
infarct on diffusion weighted imaging. The etiology was presumed 
to be ___. There was diffuse calcification of intracranial

IMAGING:
CT CODE STROKE PROTOCOL (CT, CTA, CTP)
No hemorrhage, and no definite CT evidence of acute vascular
territory infarct. Extensive white matter hypodensity likely
reflects
sequelae of chronic small vessel disease, but also makes it
difficult to rule out small acute lacune. Ventricular and sulcal
prominence is most consistent with atrophy
MRI
acute infarct ___ the right medulla . multiple punctate areas of
susceptibility artifact on GRE, most consistent with amyloid
angiopathy.
other findings consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
changes and prior infarcts.
TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are focal calcifications ___ the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There
is no pericardial effusion.
REPEAT CT ___ ___:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Right
hypodensity ___ the medulla (2:7) is progressed from the
comparison study dated
___, representing evolution of the known infarction ___
that
location. Note is made of periventricular white matter hypodense
areas which
are bilateral, reflecting chronic microvascular infarction.
Ventriclar and
sulcal enlargement signifies parenchymal volume loss. There is
no fracture.
Fluid ___ the mastoid air cells on the left, is new from
___ as is fluid
layering ___ the nasopharynx and a small air-fluid level seen ___
the sphenoid
sinus. Marked atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect or obvious
new infarct. If
there is continued concern, consider MR ___ if not
___.
2. Expected evolution of the known right medulla infarction.
3. New fluid ___ the mastoid air cells on the left as well as ___
the sphenoid
sinus and nasopharynx.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo LHW with h/o HTN and prior CVA with residual left sided
weakness presents with acute right facial droop, N/V and
nystagmus.
NEURO:
Patient presented to ED and code stroke called. NIHSS was 6,
however 3 points were from prior CVA. This was considered a low
score and t-PA was not indicated. CT, CTA and CTP showed no
acute abnormalities, only evidence of old lacunar infarcts and
atrophy. Patient's neurologic exam was significant for
dysarthria, right facial droop, left gaze preference with
inability to cross midline toward right side, with nystagmus on
attempts to look right, left sided hemiparesis and hemisensory
loss. She was also profusely vomiting despite receiving Zofran.
Given multiple cranial nerve involvement, localization was
thought to be brainstem, specifically pons.
BP was allowed to autoregulate, and patient was started on ASA
325mg. Home dose of statin was increased, and atenolol was
halved during acute period.
MRI showed a right lateral medullary/pontine-meduallary junction
infarct on diffusion weighted imaging. The etiology was presumed
to be ___. There was diffuse calcification of intracranial
vessels, and it was thought that an artery-to-artery embolism
could have originated from the right vertebral.
TTE demonstrated an EF of 80% with normal wall motion. Telemetry
revealed sinus rhythm with PACs.
Further workup for embolic source was not completed given
patient's age and comorbidites (ie baseline left hemiparesis),
which make her a less than ideal candidate for coumadin.
She had not been taking ASA, for unclear reasons, so this will
be a good starting point.
RESP:
Patient developed respiratory distress ___ the ED after several
episodes of vomiting. She had impaired gag reflex, and likely
aspirated. She required nonrebreather, and it was felt that she
could not support breathing independently. The situation was
discussed with patient and her son, and decision was made to
intubate.
CXR showed RML infiltrate c/w aspiration pneumonitis. Patient
then had low grade fever and elevated WBC on day 2. She failed

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a newly diagnosed left
breast cancer in the setting of prior BCT to the same breast. 

Today, I reviewed the entire spectrum of breast reconstructive
therapy including immediate, delayed, and delayed immediate
reconstruction and delayed.  Similarly, we discussed implant
(tissue expander/implant) versus autologous (pedicled TRAM, free
TRAM, ___, Latissimus) reconstructive options as well as hybrid
procedures (latissimus with implant).  We discussed the
trade-offs of each school of reconstruction including the 
shorter
operative times with implant based reconstruction although the
implants themselves have a limited life span and are not as
natural when palpated.   With autologous reconstruction, longer
operative times are balanced with more natural tissues though 
the
patient ___ have additional donor sites and recovery.  

The patient understands the operations, the options, the 
expected
outcomes and the potential risks and complications that include,
but are not limited to: infection, scarring, bleeding, unsightly
scarring, wound separation and delayed healing, fluid
collections, hematomas, need for repeated aspirations, partial 
or
complete skin flap necrosis and loss, expander
extrusion/leak/infection, implant leak and deflation/silicone
extrusion, implant infection, capsular contracture formation 
with
hardening of the breast or change in shape, asymmetry, contour
irregularities, need for further surgery, loss of flap including
potential emergent surgery.

Lastly, there are serious but extremely uncommon complications
related to receiving an anesthetic. Furthermore, I explained 
that
there are so many variables that exist in the healing process
that affect the final outcome.  These are not entirely
predictable and that final results may be disappointing despite
all surgery and care being done appropriately.  The patient
understands these risks and all of her questions were answered. 

The patient is strongly interested in an autologous based
reconstruction and, given her prior BCT, this would be ideal. 
The patient is strongly interested in pursuing an immediate ___
flap reconstruction which is also very appropriate.  ___ d/w 
Dr.
___.  ___ obtain a pre-operative CTA of the abdomen.

Thank you for this kind referral.

I have spent 60 total minutes face-to-face with this patient.
Over half of that time was spent in counseling the patient on 
her
anticipated breast defects. We discussed reconstructive options.

Endotracheal intubation
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old gentleman found by police outside ___ 
agitated and running around naked, stating he had taken ___. 
En route to the ED, pt had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure 
and received 1mg Ativan. Patient had a urine tox positive for 
cocaine.  

In the ED the patient remained agitated, diaphoretic, with 
dilated pupils. Initial vitals were: T 38.3 HR 160 BP 170s/80s 
O2 sat 100% in RA. The patient was intubated for agitation and 
sedated with propofol and versed. Per MICU note, after 
intubation, patient's vitals improved to SBP of 110s-120s, HR to 
110s, and Temperature of 37.1. Initial labs were notable for Na: 
154, Cl. 109, Cr. 1.4 pH initially 6.96 on VBG, then 7.06 on ABG 
and then 7.41 on ABG, lactate of 16.7, CPK 1065, ___: 12.8, INR: 
1.2 Serum tox negative. He was given 2 amps of sodium bicarb and 
started on sodium bicarb gtt at 150 ml/hr. Pt also given 4 mg of 
IV ativan for seizure pxx.  

Per toxicology, the patient's initial EKG was consistent with 
cocaine toxicity given prolonged QTc interval.  Q6HR EKG's were 
ordered with a stable QTc 30 minutes after decreasing bicarb gtt 
from 150 ml/hr to 75 ml/hr and bicarb gtt was discontinued. A CT 
head showed no acute intracranial abnormality and a juvenile 
nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, and a CT cervical spine showed no 
malalignment or fx. The patient was extubated, started on 
thiamine, folate, and mutli-vitamins, and his diet was advanced 
without difficulty. Of note the patient's CPK has been trending 
up to 1666, receiving IVF w/o complaints of myalgias. 

Vitals on transfer: 98.5, 110/51, HR 83, 17, 98% RA. Today the 
patient has little recollection of events. He recalls taking 
tablets in the evening and placing them on his gums. He went for 
a walk w/ friends, smoked marijuana, and went to ___ practice 
while tripping. Patient felt paranoid while walking outside, 
felt that people were trying to steal his backpack. Thus, the 
patient returned back to his room, where he thought he was being 
attacked. Patient believes he called his father or 911 for help. 


The patient currently feels fine. He is worried about 
repercussions from his school, and is feeling anxious. He has 
experienced anxiety in the past. Upon waking up in the MICU, the 
patient felt fine and thought that he was in his dorm room. He 
is wondering when he can go home.

IMAGING:

___ CXR

FINDINGS: Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. The 
endotracheal tube is
present 9.2 cm above the carina. The enteric tube is present 
with distal tip
and sideholes in the stomach. Cardiomediastinal and hilar 
contours are stable.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Lungs are well 
expanded and
clear.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for 
pneumonia.  
 
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube malpositioned. Advancement by 
several
centimeters is recommended. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

___ C-spine CT noncon
FINDINGS:  There is no fracture or malalignment of the cervical 
spine.  The
atlanto-occipital and -axial articulations are intact.  There is 
no
prevertebral soft tissue edema, though there are NG and ET tubes 
coursing
through the visualized pharynx.  There is no cervical 
lymphadenopathy.  The
thyroid gland is normal.  The visualized lung apices are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:  No acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical 
spine.

___ Head CT Noncon
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial abnormality.
2.  2.7 cm mass partially imaged within the right maxillary 
sinus compatible
with a juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA).  Further 
imaging with
dedicated MR is recommended.
 
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW:  In overall appearance, the 
maxillary mass
would be quite atypical for JNA, which generally show present as 
a soft-tissue
mass in the nasopharynx or nasal cavity, a mass in the 
pterygopalatine fossa,
or erosion of posterior osseous margin of the sphenopalantine 
foramen
extending to the base of the medial pterygoid plate.  Rarely, 
JNA may be
limited to the maxillary sinus.
 
Other entities such as inflammatory polyp (particularly given 
the history) and
even malignant sinus tumor should be considered, and biopsy may 
be considered,
depending on the clinical context.

___ EKG
Sinus rhythm with an intermittent ectopic atrial rhythm and 
possible wandering
atrial pacemaker. Right ventricular conduction delay with 
vertical QRS axis.
Slightly peaked sinus P waves raising consideration of right 
atrial overload.
Prominent R wave in lead V4 may be a physiologic variant. 
Compared to the
previous tracing of ___ varying atrial pacemaker is now 
seen.

___ EKG
Extremely marked supraventricular tachycardia which is probably 
sinus, although
atrial tachcyardia is not excluded. P-R interval is about 120 
milliseconds.
Right bundle-branch block. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. 
Exclude an
right ventricular overload syndrome, if clinically indicated. No 
previous
tracing available for comparison. Clinical correlation is 
suggested.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is an ___ male with pmh of marijuana, 
alcohol, and occasional cocaine presented w/ agitation who was 
admitted after being found agitated with hypertension, 
tachycardia, dilated pupils and a tonic-clonic seizure requiring 
intubation and found to have cocaine toxicity.

# Overdose:  Patient's utox was positive for cocaine with no 
other positives on urine or serum tox screen though unclear if 
the patient also ingested ___, a pure form of NMDA (which he 
had admitted to when he was picked up by the police). On further 
discussions with the patient and family members, he had ingested 
a combination of Adderall, cocaine and LSD. His presentation of 
extreme tachycardia, hypertension and hyperthermia was likely 
more consistent with cocaine toxicity than ___ per discussion 
with toxicology. He was maintained on a D5W drip with 
bicarbonate for pH target range between 7.45-7.55 especially 
given the QRS prolongation seen on ECG in the ED. ECGs were 
obtained q6h for QRS monitoring and his intervals did normalize 
over his course in the ICU. At time of transfer to the floor, 
comprehensive urine and serum toxicology panels had been sent to 
___ for further analysis. Pt was stable on floor and mentating 
normally but held overnight per toxicology given concern for 
continued sympathomimetic effect as he was tachycardic with even 
slight exertion despite fluid bolus. F/u EKGs showed narrowing 
of QRS and return to baseline. He was discharged with stable 
vital signs after improved hydration and waning sympathomimetic 
effect.

# Airway compromise: The patient was intubated for non-secure 
airway secondary to agitation and tonic-clonic seizures. He was 
initially sedated with a combination of propofol and midazolam. 
These medications were weaned when the patient's vitals 
normalized and he was extubated without complications on HD#1.

# Elevated CK: Likely secondary to tonic-clonic seizures. The 
patient was initially given IVF rehydration, however his CK 
never reached a level >5,000 decreasing our suspicion for renal 
impairment. CK trended down daily from 1600s to 300s by day of 
discharge without intervention. 

# Lactic acidosis:  Likely explained by the seizure en route to 
the hospital as it rapidly returned to normal with fluids. 

Transitional issues:
-Patient will likely leave school this semester and return home 
to ___ where he will enter drug rehab facility
-Per pt's mother, will need psychiatric care as he has 
underlying emotional problems
-Will need PCP follow up, currently booked for appointment with 
___ ___
-Incidental finding requiring follow-up:
CT head on ___ visualized a ""2.7 cm mass partially imaged

Dear Mr. ___:

As you know you were admitted here for agitation after a cocaine 
overdose. You were initially cared for in the ICU where you were 
intubated to help you breathe and your heart was monitored 
closely. You were soon transferred to the medicine floor where 
the activity of your heart was again monitored closely. You 
heart rate was too fast during much of your stay but slowed 
before discharge. During your admission, you denied any 
discomfort and after close observation the team felt that it was 
safe for you to return home. 

We highly encourage you to avoid using illicit drugs. It is very 
dangerous to your health and their effects can be life 
threatening. Additionally, using drugs may jeopardize your

History of Present Illness:
___ year old gentleman found by police outside ___
agitated and running around naked, stating he had taken ___.
En route to the ED, pt had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure
and received 1mg Ativan. Patient had a urine tox positive for
cocaine.
In the ED the patient remained agitated, diaphoretic, with
dilated pupils. Initial vitals were: T 38.3 HR 160 BP 170s/80s
O2 sat 100% in RA. The patient was intubated for agitation and
sedated with propofol and versed. Per MICU note, after
intubation, patient's vitals improved to SBP of 110s-120s, HR to
110s, and Temperature of 37.1. Initial labs were notable for Na:
154, Cl. 109, Cr. 1.4 pH initially 6.96 on VBG, then 7.06 on ABG
and then 7.41 on ABG, lactate of 16.7, CPK 1065, ___: 12.8, INR:
1.2 Serum tox negative. He was given 2 amps of sodium bicarb and
started on sodium bicarb gtt at 150 ml/hr. Pt also given 4 mg of
IV ativan for seizure pxx.
Per toxicology, the patient's initial EKG was consistent with
cocaine toxicity given prolonged QTc interval. Q6HR EKG's were
ordered with a stable QTc 30 minutes after decreasing bicarb gtt
from 150 ml/hr to 75 ml/hr and bicarb gtt was discontinued. A CT
head showed no acute intracranial abnormality and a juvenile
nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, and a CT cervical spine showed no
malalignment or fx. The patient was extubated, started on
thiamine, folate, and mutli-vitamins, and his diet was advanced
without difficulty. Of note the patient's CPK has been trending
up to 1666, receiving IVF w/o complaints of myalgias.
Vitals on transfer: 98.5, 110/51, HR 83, 17, 98% RA. Today the
patient has little recollection of events. He recalls taking
tablets in the evening and placing them on his gums. He went for
a walk w/ friends, smoked marijuana, and went to ___ practice
while tripping. Patient felt paranoid while walking outside,
felt that people were trying to steal his backpack. Thus, the
patient returned back to his room, where he thought he was being
attacked. Patient believes he called his father or 911 for help.
The patient currently feels fine. He is worried about
repercussions from his school, and is feeling anxious. He has
experienced anxiety in the past. Upon waking up in the MICU, the
patient felt fine and thought that he was in his dorm room. He
is wondering when he can go home.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year-old Female with oxygen-dependent COPD, CAD, 
diastolic CHF, mitral stenosis, IDDM, HTN, HLD who presented to 
an ___ ED on ___ with acute hypoxic 
respiratory failure with oxygen saturations in the 81-85% on 2L 
NC and hypotension.
.
Her partner states that she had been feeling unwell for several 
days prior to this with fatigue, chills, one an episode of 
non-bloody emesis, ""indigestion,"" decreased urine output, and 
back pain. She had completed a course of antibiotics and 
Prednisone as an outpatient earlier this month for presumed 
pneumonia. 
.
In the OSH ED, she was found to have acute renal failure with a 
creatinine of 1.9 (baseline 0.6). A CXR showed a right lower 
lobe infiltrate. Given her recent hospitalization 1-month prior, 
she was started on atypical coverage with Azithromycin as well 
as HCAP PNA coverage with Vancomycin and Zosyn. Her previous 
hospital course was complicated by an episode of hypercarbic 
respiratory failure requiring intubation, and she was intubated 
on ___ prior to bronchoscopy. She underwent a fiber-optic 
bronchscopy on ___ which showed clear tenacious secretions in 
the left mainstem, persistent bronchomalacia of the left 
mainsten, a stenosis of right middle lobe oriface. Biopsies 
showed acute inflammation and revealed no malignancy.  
.  
The patient was extubated to BiPAP following her bronchoscopy. 
She had an asystolic event with CPR and ROSC on ___ thought to

.
IMAGING:
___ 2D-ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF > 55%). The 
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with normal free 
wall contractility. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There is 
severe mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional 
mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to mitral annular 
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly underestimated.] There is moderate to severe 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Calcific mitral valve disease with mild stenosis and 
at least mild regurgitation. Mild symmetric LVH with normal 
global and regional systolic function. Dilated right ventricle 
with preserved systolic function. Moderate to severe pulmonary 
hypertension.  
.
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - In comparison with the study of 
___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially 
unchanged. There is continued substantial enlargement of the 
cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions 
with compressive atelectasis at the bases. An area of increased 
opacification that is more confluent in the mid-lung on the 
right could reflect atelectasis or 
pneumonia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a PMH significant for oxygen-dependent chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (2L NC at home), coronary artery 
disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus on insulin, and hypertension admitted to OSH with 
hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was 
transferred to ___ for concern for bronchomalacia requiring 
stenting. However, she improved with treatment for health care 
associated pneumonia, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, 
and COPD, and did not require bronchial stenting. 
.
#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE/CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE 
PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION/ACUTE-on-CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART 
FAILURE/PNEUMONIA:
Patient was transferred from ___ following 
intubation for respiratory failure and concern for 
bronchomalacia as significant contributor (bronch there showed 
clear tenacious secretions in the left mainstem, persistent 
bronchomalacia of the left mainsten, and stenosis of right 
middle lobe oriface - biopsies revealed no malignancy). At ___ 
she was continued on treatment for HCAP with Vancomycin and 
Zosyn was aggressively diuresed with improvement. She underwent 
bronchoscopy just prior to extubation which did not show 
stenosis and BAL fluid grew only commensal flora after abx. She 
was extubated and completed treatement with a course of 
Vancomycin for ___s started on a prednisone taper 
given likely exacerbation of COPD as a contributor to 
respiratory failure. She was discharged to continue a prolonged 
taper as recommended by her outpatient pulmonologist. She also 
endorsed increased lower extremity swelling and increased 
abdominal girth in the month leading up to hospitalization along 
with weight gain and it was felt that worsening diastolic heart 
failure was a significant contributor to her respiratory 
symptoms. A repeat 2D-Echo showed preserved EF with mild 
symmetric LVH and severe mitral annulus calcification but only 
mild mitral stenosis and 1+ MR and pulmonary HTN. She was 
diuresed aggressively to a weight of 74kg on discharge with 
improvement in her respiratory symptoms (although not completely 
back to her baseline respiratory function-on 3L O2 by NC instead 
of usual 2L). She was continued on her home BB/ACEI as well as 
COPD bronchodilators and inhaled steroid. She was discharged to 
follow up with her Cardiologist, PCP, and ___ for f/u 
of her COPD, heart failure, and renal function and to assess the 
need for any changes to her diuretic and COPD regimen.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, Hypertension:
Patient was continued on home aspirin, statin, Carvedilol, ACEI, 
long acting nitrate. 
.
#Type 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ON INSULIN - The patient has known 
IDDM and her home glucose range is noted to be 60-180s mg/dL, 
per the patient. She is controlled with Levemir 72 units SC QHS 
and Novolog sliding scale prior to meals. She was treated with 
Lantus +SSI during admission and transitioned back to her home 
Levemir on discharge.
.

mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly underestimated.] There is moderate to severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Calcific mitral valve disease with mild stenosis and
at least mild regurgitation. Mild symmetric LVH with normal
global and regional systolic function. Dilated right ventricle
with preserved systolic function. Moderate to severe pulmonary
hypertension.
.
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - In comparison with the study of
___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially
unchanged. There is continued substantial enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions
with compressive atelectasis at the bases. An area of increased
opacification that is more confluent in the mid-lung on the
right could reflect atelectasis or
pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a PMH significant for oxygen-dependent chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (2L NC at home), coronary artery
disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes
mellitus on insulin, and hypertension admitted to OSH with
hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was
transferred to ___ for concern for bronchomalacia requiring
stenting. However, she improved with treatment for health care
associated pneumonia, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure,
and COPD, and did not require bronchial stenting.
.
#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE/CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE
PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION/ACUTE-on-CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART
FAILURE/PNEUMONIA:
Patient was transferred from ___ following
intubation for respiratory failure and concern for
bronchomalacia as significant contributor (bronch there showed
clear tenacious secretions in the left mainstem, persistent
bronchomalacia of the left mainsten, and stenosis of right
middle lobe oriface - biopsies revealed no malignancy). At ___
she was continued on treatment for HCAP with Vancomycin and
Zosyn was aggressively diuresed with improvement. She underwent
bronchoscopy just prior to extubation which did not show
stenosis and BAL fluid grew only commensal flora after abx. She
was extubated and completed treatement with a course of
Vancomycin for ___s started on a prednisone taper
given likely exacerbation of COPD as a contributor to
respiratory failure. She was discharged to continue a prolonged
taper as recommended by her outpatient pulmonologist. She also
endorsed increased lower extremity swelling and increased
abdominal girth in the month leading up to hospitalization along
with weight gain and it was felt that worsening diastolic heart
failure was a significant contributor to her respiratory
symptoms. A repeat 2D-Echo showed preserved EF with mild
symmetric LVH and severe mitral annulus calcification but only
mild mitral stenosis and 1+ MR and pulmonary HTN. She was
diuresed aggressively to a weight of 74kg on discharge with
improvement in her respiratory symptoms (although not completely
back to her baseline respiratory function-on 3L O2 by NC instead
of usual 2L). She was continued on her home BB/ACEI as well as
COPD bronchodilators and inhaled steroid. She was discharged to
follow up with her Cardiologist, PCP, and ___ for f/u
of her COPD, heart failure, and renal function and to assess the
need for any changes to her diuretic and COPD regimen.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, Hypertension:
Patient was continued on home aspirin, statin, Carvedilol, ACEI,
long acting nitrate.
.
#Type 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ON INSULIN - The patient has known
IDDM and her home glucose range is noted to be 60-180s mg/dL,
per the patient. She is controlled with Levemir 72 units SC QHS
and Novolog sliding scale prior to meals. She was treated with
Lantus +SSI during admission and transitioned back to her home
Levemir on discharge.
.

IMAGING
========
CXR ___  
Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.  
Mild bibasilar 
atelectasis. 

NCHCT ___
No acute intracranial process.

Cath ___
- Elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
 Cardiogenic shock.
 Three vessel coronary artery disease.
 Successful primary PCI for STEMI of the LAD coronary artery.

TTE ___
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and extensive
regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other 
diffuse process. Likely apical aneurysm
with mural thrombus. Appropriately positioned Impella catheter. 
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , an 
apical thrombus is now seen (prior
study was not performed with Lumason and this may explain the 
difference as thrombus not seen in native
imaging/without Lumason).
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with hx of HTN, ___ disease, and HLD who 
presented to ED from ___ with altered mental status and 
seizure and was found to have EKG changes concerning for an 
anterior STEMI. The patient had a cath showing 100% stenosis 
pLAD, OM1 100% stenosis, RCA 100% stenosis proximal, mid, distal 
s/p DESx2 to LAD. Impella was placed for support. Overnight from 
___, the patient went into VT storm leading to a code 
with multiple shocks. He continued to have hemodynamic 
decompensation following this with poor mental status. He was 
eventually made CMO and passed away on ___.

#STEMI s/p POBA, DES x2 to LAD
#Cardiogenic shock s/p impella placement
#Elevated lactate
STEMI ___ 100% proximal LAD occlusion, 100% proximal OM1, 100%
RCA occlusion leading to decreased EF and poor cardiac output.
Extremities are remained cool. Urine output decreased and he was 
started on CRRT as below. Impella was placed during the cath but 
the patient continued to have worsening hemodynamics requiring 
pressors despite impella support. There were issues with suction 
events as well as VT storm as below. He was eventually made CMO, 
Impella was turned off and the patient passed away quickly 
after.

# VT storm
Pt with VT storm overnight ___, requiring multiple 
shocks, later
stabilized on lidocaine and amio drip.

#apical thrombus
Apical thrombus visualized on TTE on ___. Potentially occluding
the impella inflow. He received systemic AC with heparin

#HFrEF (___)
TTE with EF ~20%. Extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Likely ___ ischemic cardiomyopathy.
PRELOAD:    CVP elevated, with evidence of increased right sided
filling pressures, PCWP elevated, was on CRRT, inotropy with
dobutamine
AFTERLOAD: dobutamine with uptrending SVRs. 
NHBK: held iso shock
INOTROPE:  dobutamine, levophed 
MECH SUPPORT: Impella CP

#Intubation
Encephalopathy likely due to cardiogenic shock and poor cerebral
perfusion. Intubated for airway protection due to altered mental
status.

#Seizure
Reported seizure at ___. Per daughter, pt was noted to be
talking, interactive and then started to stare into space, then
body became rigid and he started to shake. Was given Keppra in
the ED.

# ___ on CKD
Pt baseline Cr 1.16 (___). Likely ischemic ATN. Cr slightly
improved on CRRT.

# transaminases
Secondary to shock liver iso cardiogenic shock.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ male with history of CAD s/p CABG in ___ 
(LIMA-LAD and SVG-Ramus), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CRI, 
unilateral vocal cord paralysis after CABG in ___, and 
sarcoidosis who presents now with exertional dyspnea and chest 
pain concerning for unstable angina.  

Mr. ___ did well s/p CABG in ___, though had recurrent chest 
pain ___ years later. Exercise thallium test ___ showed 
mild anteroapical ischemia, but given patient did not want to 
procede with repeat cath, he was continued on medical management 
of CAD. However, over the past several months he has had 
increasing exertional dyspnea, prompting repeat exercise 
thallium stess test on ___. This study showed no ischemia, 
but did show evidence of a borderline increase in LV filling 
pressure during exercise. Had echo ___, which showed mild 
concentric LVH, decreased LV diastolic compliance, and 
borderline pulmonary hypertension. LVEF was preserved.  
 
Patient had been started on furosemide 20mg daily by his 
cardiologist in late ___, given concern that exertional 
dyspnea may be secondary to ___. Patient's symptoms did not 
improve, and he also began to develop exertional chest pain. He 
describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation across his chest 
which is non-radiating and comes on after walking a short 
distance. The pressure is associated with mild dyspnea, but no 
dizziness, nausea, or diaphoresis. The pain resolves within one 
minute if he stops to rest. Over the past ___ days, he has also 
had similar chest pressure with minimal activity such as washing 
dishes. He saw his cardiologist for follow-up in clinic 
yesterday, who was concerned that his symptoms are due to 
recurrent ischemia. Cardiologist recommended right and left 
heart cath for further evaluation, and patient is admitted now 
for pre-cath hydration given CRI, with plans for cath early 
tomorrow morning.  

On arrival to the floor, patient is comfortable and denies any 
dyspnea or chest pain. Denies any HA, dizziness/lightheadedness. 
 

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools 
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He 
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Does report chronic 
non-productive cough, chronic right-sided leg cramps at night. 
All of the other review of systems were negative.  

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of PND, 
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. 
Patient does report ___ pound weight gain over past several 
months.

IMAGING:
ECG ___: Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. 
Otherwise, tracing is within normal limits. No previous tracing 
available for comparison.  

CXR ___: 
1. Scattered interstitial and alveolar opacities. Differential 
diagnosis 
includes pulmonary sarcoidois, however, basilar changes suggest 
an additional interstial lung disease or superimposed pulmonary 
edema.  
2. Pleural irregularity, possible asbestos exposure.  

TTE ___: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion.   

CTA Chest ___: 
1. No aortic dissection. 
2. Extensive moderately severe atherosclerosis of the aorta and 
its branches, including thoracic aortic arch ulcers as 
described, and ulcerated mixed plaque in the proximal left 
subclavian artery, of undetermined age. There is no periaortic 
bleeding. 
3. Occlusion of the left vertebral artery from its origin, of 
undetermined 
age. 
4. Extensive scarring in both apices and lung bases consistent 
with the given history of sarcoidosis, comparison with prior 
imaging is suggested to determine disease activity. 
5. Very mild pulmonary edema.  
6. Solid left renal lesion, possible renal cell carcinoma. 
7. Chronic mild scarring and traction bronchiectasis, right 
lower lobe. 

CARDIAC CATH ___ (Prelim):
Right dominant
LMCA 30% tapering distally
LAD 90% ostial stenosis
LCX 70% ostial stenosis
RCA 95% proximal stenosis
SVG-OM1 patent
LIMA-LAD unable to engage for selective injection because of 
tortuosity of left subclavian
Ascending aorta and arch - no obvious dissection

CARDIAC CATH ___: report pending
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL, CRI and 
sarcoidosis who presented for cardiac catheterization in setting 
of progressive dyspnea on exertion and new onset exertional 
chest pain, concerning for unstable angina.  

# Exertional Dyspnea/Chest Pain/CAD: Exertional dyspnea and 
chest pain prior to admission were concerning for unstable 
angina.  Patient underwent right and left heart cath on ___, 
which revealed patent SVG-OM1 graft, presumed patent LIMA-LAD 
graft, and new proximal 95% RCA stenosis.  Patient developed 
severe, non-pleuritic pain across his chest during the procedure 
and had vagal response, requiring administration of atropine and 
increased IVF.  He did not have any acute ST changes on ECG, and 
CTA chest was negative for dissection or PE.  Had slight 
troponin bump, which was felt to be secondary to demand ischemia 
in setting of hypotension from vagal response.  Patient was 
transferred to CCU for close BP monitoring, and later became 
hypertensive requiring nitro gtt.  Went back to cath lab on 
___ for repeat cath with DES placed to RCA.  Patient 
tolerated procedure well and did not have further CP during the 
admission.  He remained hemodynamically stable, and was weaned 
off nitro gtt.  Was discharged on regimen of aspirin 325mg 
daily, plavix 75mg daily, simvastatin, and metoprolol.  ACE 
inhibitor was not started given Cr slightly elevated above 
baseline, though patient would likely benefit from addition of 
ACEi if Cr remains stable in outpatient setting.  Patient will 
follow-up with his cardiologist within 1 week of discharge.

# Acute dCHF: Recent echo ___ showed preserved LVEF but 
evidence of diastolic dysfunction, and diastolic dysfunction 
also present on recent exercise thallium test.  TTE ___ 
showed EF >55%.  Cardiac cath revealed mildly increased right 
and left heart filling pressures, again consistent with 
diastolic dysfunction.  Patient's exam was suggestive of volume 
overload, and HTN was likely contributing to acute exacerbation 
of dCHF.  Patient's home furosemide dose increased from 20mg 
daily to 40mg daily on discharge.  He was continued on a beta 
blocker, though atenolol changed to metoprolol given underlying 
CKD.  Patient will likely benefit from an ACE inhibitor, though 
this was deferred to outpatient setting given Cr slightly above 
baseline during this admission.  

# Hypertension: Patient hypertensive on admission, and of note 
briefly required nitro gtt during his hospital course for 
management of hypertension.  His nifedipine dose was increased 
from 30mg daily to 60mg daily, and atenolol was changed to 
metoprolol given underlying CKD.  Patient will need BP monitored 
in follow-up, and may need further adjustment to 
anti-hypertensive regimen.  ___ benefit from ACE inhibitor, 
though this was deferred to outpatient provider given ___ 
elevated above baseline this admission.
 
# CKD: Baseline Cr 1.9, and Cr ranged 1.9-2.2 this admission.  
Patient received pre-cath hydration, as he is at higher risk for 
contrast-induced nephropathy given low GFR.  His Cr was stable 
during the admission, but should be rechecked in follow-up the 
week of ___.  As above, if Cr stable, patient will likely 
benefit from ACE inhibitor. 

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin 20mg daily.  

# Sarcoidosis: CXR this admission revealed scattered 
interstitial and alveolar opacities, which could represent 
pulmonary sarcoidosis.  Patient will follow-up with his PCP.

# Left renal mass: CTA chest revealed incidental finding of 38 x 
37mm peripherally enhancing solid left renal lesion, concerning 
for a renal cell carcinoma.  Patient will follow-up with PCP 
within one week of discharge, and will likely need MRI for 
further evaluation based on radiology recommendations.  Pending 
MRI results, patient may require biopsy or resection, as well as 
referral to heme/onc if mass determined to be malignant.

PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
-final cardiac catheterization report from ___

TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:
-Patient's code status was DNR/DNI this admission
-Patient will likely need outpatient MRI for further evaluation 
of left renal mass, and may eventually need biopsy or resection 
of mass as well as referral to hematology/oncology if mass 
determined to be malignant
-Patient will need renal function checked at follow-up 
appointment week of ___
-Patient will need to be on aspirin 325mg daily, plavix 75mg 
daily x12 months

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for a cardiac catheterization, 
for further evaluation of your shortness of breath and chest 
pressure.  During your catheterization on ___, you developed 
the sudden onset of chest pain.  This was likely caused by 
having decreased blood flow to the heart because your blood 
pressure was low.  

You were briefly admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of 
your blood pressure, which improved.  You had a repeat cardiac 
catheterization on ___, and had a stent placed into one of 
the coronary arteries.  You will need to continue taking 
aspirin, and will also need to take a new medication called 
clopidogrel (plavix) daily for the next ___ months.  It is very 
important that you take this medication daily, and that you 
speak with Dr. ___ stopping it for any reason.

Your CT scan revealed that there is a mass on your left kidney, 
which could represent a cancer.  We will let Dr. ___ about 
this lesion.  You may need to have an MRI to look more closely 
at the kidney, and ultimately they may decide to either biopsy 
the lesion or remove it.

We made the following changes to your medications while you were 
here:
1. STARTED clopidogrel (plavix) 75mg daily
2. STOPPED atenolol
3. STARTED metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice daily
4. INCREASED furosemide to 40mg daily
5. INCREASED nifedipine to 60mg daily

Weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if your weight 
goes up more than 3 lbs.

IMAGING:
ECG ___: Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality.
Otherwise, tracing is within normal limits. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
CXR ___:
1. Scattered interstitial and alveolar opacities. Differential
diagnosis
includes pulmonary sarcoidois, however, basilar changes suggest
an additional interstial lung disease or superimposed pulmonary
edema.
2. Pleural irregularity, possible asbestos exposure.
TTE ___: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
CTA Chest ___:
1. No aortic dissection.
2. Extensive moderately severe atherosclerosis of the aorta and
its branches, including thoracic aortic arch ulcers as
described, and ulcerated mixed plaque in the proximal left
subclavian artery, of undetermined age. There is no periaortic
bleeding.
3. Occlusion of the left vertebral artery from its origin, of
undetermined
age.
4. Extensive scarring in both apices and lung bases consistent
with the given history of sarcoidosis, comparison with prior
imaging is suggested to determine disease activity.
5. Very mild pulmonary edema.
6. Solid left renal lesion, possible renal cell carcinoma.
7. Chronic mild scarring and traction bronchiectasis, right
lower lobe.
CARDIAC CATH ___ (Prelim):
Right dominant
LMCA 30% tapering distally
LAD 90% ostial stenosis
LCX 70% ostial stenosis
RCA 95% proximal stenosis
SVG-OM1 patent
LIMA-LAD unable to engage for selective injection because of
tortuosity of left subclavian
Ascending aorta and arch - no obvious dissection
CARDIAC CATH ___: report pending
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL, CRI and
sarcoidosis who presented for cardiac catheterization in setting
of progressive dyspnea on exertion and new onset exertional
chest pain, concerning for unstable angina.
# Exertional Dyspnea/Chest Pain/CAD: Exertional dyspnea and
chest pain prior to admission were concerning for unstable
angina. Patient underwent right and left heart cath on ___,
which revealed patent SVG-OM1 graft, presumed patent LIMA-LAD
graft, and new proximal 95% RCA stenosis. Patient developed
severe, non-pleuritic pain across his chest during the procedure
and had vagal response, requiring administration of atropine and
increased IVF. He did not have any acute ST changes on ECG, and
CTA chest was negative for dissection or PE. Had slight
troponin bump, which was felt to be secondary to demand ischemia
in setting of hypotension from vagal response. Patient was
transferred to CCU for close BP monitoring, and later became
hypertensive requiring nitro gtt. Went back to cath lab on
___ for repeat cath with DES placed to RCA. Patient
tolerated procedure well and did not have further CP during the
admission. He remained hemodynamically stable, and was weaned
off nitro gtt. Was discharged on regimen of aspirin 325mg
daily, plavix 75mg daily, simvastatin, and metoprolol. ACE
inhibitor was not started given Cr slightly elevated above
baseline, though patient would likely benefit from addition of
ACEi if Cr remains stable in outpatient setting. Patient will
follow-up with his cardiologist within 1 week of discharge.
# Acute dCHF: Recent echo ___ showed preserved LVEF but
evidence of diastolic dysfunction, and diastolic dysfunction
also present on recent exercise thallium test. TTE ___
showed EF >55%. Cardiac cath revealed mildly increased right
and left heart filling pressures, again consistent with
diastolic dysfunction. Patient's exam was suggestive of volume
overload, and HTN was likely contributing to acute exacerbation
of dCHF. Patient's home furosemide dose increased from 20mg
daily to 40mg daily on discharge. He was continued on a beta
blocker, though atenolol changed to metoprolol given underlying
CKD. Patient will likely benefit from an ACE inhibitor, though
this was deferred to outpatient setting given Cr slightly above
baseline during this admission.
# Hypertension: Patient hypertensive on admission, and of note
briefly required nitro gtt during his hospital course for
management of hypertension. His nifedipine dose was increased
from 30mg daily to 60mg daily, and atenolol was changed to
metoprolol given underlying CKD. Patient will need BP monitored
in follow-up, and may need further adjustment to
anti-hypertensive regimen. ___ benefit from ACE inhibitor,
though this was deferred to outpatient provider given ___
elevated above baseline this admission.
# CKD: Baseline Cr 1.9, and Cr ranged 1.9-2.2 this admission.
Patient received pre-cath hydration, as he is at higher risk for
contrast-induced nephropathy given low GFR. His Cr was stable
during the admission, but should be rechecked in follow-up the
week of ___. As above, if Cr stable, patient will likely
benefit from ACE inhibitor.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin 20mg daily.
# Sarcoidosis: CXR this admission revealed scattered
interstitial and alveolar opacities, which could represent
pulmonary sarcoidosis. Patient will follow-up with his PCP.
# Left renal mass: CTA chest revealed incidental finding of 38 x
37mm peripherally enhancing solid left renal lesion, concerning
for a renal cell carcinoma. Patient will follow-up with PCP
within one week of discharge, and will likely need MRI for
further evaluation based on radiology recommendations. Pending
MRI results, patient may require biopsy or resection, as well as
referral to heme/onc if mass determined to be malignant.
PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
-final cardiac catheterization report from ___
TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:
-Patient's code status was DNR/DNI this admission
-Patient will likely need outpatient MRI for further evaluation
of left renal mass, and may eventually need biopsy or resection
of mass as well as referral to hematology/oncology if mass
determined to be malignant
-Patient will need renal function checked at follow-up
appointment week of ___
-Patient will need to be on aspirin 325mg daily, plavix 75mg
daily x12 months

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital for a cardiac catheterization,
for further evaluation of your shortness of breath and chest
pressure. During your catheterization on ___, you developed
the sudden onset of chest pain. This was likely caused by
having decreased blood flow to the heart because your blood
pressure was low.
You were briefly admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of
your blood pressure, which improved. You had a repeat cardiac
catheterization on ___, and had a stent placed into one of
the coronary arteries. You will need to continue taking
aspirin, and will also need to take a new medication called
clopidogrel (plavix) daily for the next ___ months. It is very
important that you take this medication daily, and that you
speak with Dr. ___ stopping it for any reason.
Your CT scan revealed that there is a mass on your left kidney,
which could represent a cancer. We will let Dr. ___ about
this lesion. You may need to have an MRI to look more closely
at the kidney, and ultimately they may decide to either biopsy
the lesion or remove it.
We made the following changes to your medications while you were
here:
1. STARTED clopidogrel (plavix) 75mg daily
2. STOPPED atenolol
3. STARTED metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice daily
4. INCREASED furosemide to 40mg daily
5. INCREASED nifedipine to 60mg daily
Weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if your weight
goes up more than 3 lbs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ hx IDDM, HTN, HLD, CKD who presents with 
weakness secondary to hypoglycemia.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
#Hypoglycemia
#Type ___ Diabetes Mellitus: 
Patient presented after feeling weak in his outpatient 
nephrologist's office and found to have a blood glucose of 29. 
Patient was given juice and brought to the ED with improvement 
in blood glucose. Of note, patient's home insulin regimen was 
recently changed to standing Novolog 15U BID and glargine 20U 
QHS and takes Novolog without regard to whether he is eating or 
not. Patient also has only been checking blood glucose ~1x per 
week and notes that it has been relatively well controlled. 
Patient's Novolog was discontinued after presentation and he 
received 10U glargine overnight. Patient is amenable to more 
frequent glucose checks (prior to each meal) and starting a 
sliding scale to help prevent hypoglycemic episodes. He also 
understands that he only needs to take Novolog if he is going to 
have a meal. He was discharged on home glargine 20U QHS and 
Novolog ISS. He agrees to have close follow up with his primary 
care physician to adjust dosage for better glucose control. 

#NSTEMI
Patient found to have elevated troponins and CK-MB to 0.08 and 
15, respectively, at time of presentation. EKG was similar to 
prior EKG in ___. Denied any symptoms of chest pain or 
shortness of breath. Repeat enzymes were downtrending, with 
Trop-T of 0.07 and CK-MB of 13. Suspect that patient had type ___ 
NSTEMI with underlying stable plaque and associated troponin 
leak in setting of acute stress related to hypoglycemia. Per 
patient, he had a normal stress test last year at ___. 
Given troponin leak, P-MIBI was not pursued but patient would 
likely benefit from stress test as outpatient. Patient was 
started on atorvastatin 80mg daily. He was kept on his home 
aspirin 81mg daily, carvedilol 12.5mg po BID, HCTZ 25mg po 
daily, and lisinopril 40mg daily. 

#Hyperkalemia
Potassium elevated to 5.3 at presentation, unchanged from K on 
___. Patient has history of CKD stage III and is on lisinopril 
as outpatient. EKG without peaked T waves. Given diabetes and 
proteinuria, patient was kept on lisinopril. His potassium 
remained stable at 5.2 at time of discharge. 

# Normocytic Anemia: 
Suspect to be related to underlying CKD. Up to date on 
colonoscopies and denying any melena or hematochezia. Hb stable 
during hospitalization, at 9.9 at discharge. Iron studies 
pending at time of discharge. 

 CHRONIC ISSUES: 
 =============== 
#CKD: Cr remained around 2, at baseline. 
#Hypertension: Continue anti-hypertensives as above
#Insomnia: Continue trazodone 
#Anxiety: Continue sertraline

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
New Medications:
- Atorvastatin 80 mg PO/NG QPM 
Changed Medications:
- Insulin Novolog 15U BID changed to sliding scale

[] Diabetes - insulin regimen changed to glargine 20U QHS and 
Novolog ISS. Adjust as needed for better glucose control.
[] Hyperkalemia - consider decreasing lisinopril or increasing 
HCTZ depending on BP
[] Type ___ NSTEMI - consider outpatient P-MIBI for further 
evaluation
[] Anemia - follow up iron studies

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

Thank you for choosing ___ for 
your site of care!

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
-You were admitted because you were found to have a low blood 
sugar. 

What was done for me while I was in the hospital?
-You were given juice with improvement in your blood sugar.
-Your home Novolog dosing was changed from 15U twice a day to 
sliding scale based on glucose value prior to meals.
-Your blood work showed that your heart enzymes were elevated. 
We suspect this occurred due to the low blood glucose. You were 
monitored and had no chest pain. You will need further heart 
work up as an outpatient. 

What should I do when I leave the hospital?
-You will need to have a cardiac stress test as an outpatient.
-You will need to check your blood sugar before each meal and 
only take Novolog based on the sliding scale provided to you.
-You need to keep track of your blood sugars and work with Dr. 
___ to adjust your insulin dosing in the future. 
-Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed.
-Please follow up with the listed providers below.

** We changed your insulin. Please follow the instructions below 
and call Dr. ___ your blood sugar is less than 70 or 
greater than 400 before taking any sliding scale insulin. Again, 
please check your blood sugars three times per day and only take 
your Novolog if you are having a meal.

At bedtime, check your blood sugar and if greater than 100, take 
your nightly dose of 20U Lantus. If less than 100, call your 
doctor before injecting the insulin.

Before each meal, check your blood glucose. Only if you are 
planning on eating a meal, please inject Novolog at the 
following doses based on your blood sugar:
- Blood sugar: less than 70 - drink juice and call your doctor
- Blood sugar: 71-150 - none
- Blood sugar: 151-200 - 2U Novolog
- Blood sugar: 201-250 - 4U Novolog
- Blood sugar: 251-300 - 6U Novolog
- Blood sugar: 301-350 - 8U Novolog

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ hx IDDM, HTN, HLD, CKD who presents with
weakness secondary to hypoglycemia.
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Hypoglycemia
#Type ___ Diabetes Mellitus:
Patient presented after feeling weak in his outpatient
nephrologist's office and found to have a blood glucose of 29.
Patient was given juice and brought to the ED with improvement
in blood glucose. Of note, patient's home insulin regimen was
recently changed to standing Novolog 15U BID and glargine 20U
QHS and takes Novolog without regard to whether he is eating or
not. Patient also has only been checking blood glucose ~1x per
week and notes that it has been relatively well controlled.
Patient's Novolog was discontinued after presentation and he
received 10U glargine overnight. Patient is amenable to more
frequent glucose checks (prior to each meal) and starting a
sliding scale to help prevent hypoglycemic episodes. He also
understands that he only needs to take Novolog if he is going to
have a meal. He was discharged on home glargine 20U QHS and
Novolog ISS. He agrees to have close follow up with his primary
care physician to adjust dosage for better glucose control.
#NSTEMI
Patient found to have elevated troponins and CK-MB to 0.08 and
15, respectively, at time of presentation. EKG was similar to
prior EKG in ___. Denied any symptoms of chest pain or
shortness of breath. Repeat enzymes were downtrending, with
Trop-T of 0.07 and CK-MB of 13. Suspect that patient had type ___
NSTEMI with underlying stable plaque and associated troponin
leak in setting of acute stress related to hypoglycemia. Per
patient, he had a normal stress test last year at ___.
Given troponin leak, P-MIBI was not pursued but patient would
likely benefit from stress test as outpatient. Patient was
started on atorvastatin 80mg daily. He was kept on his home
aspirin 81mg daily, carvedilol 12.5mg po BID, HCTZ 25mg po
daily, and lisinopril 40mg daily.
#Hyperkalemia
Potassium elevated to 5.3 at presentation, unchanged from K on
___. Patient has history of CKD stage III and is on lisinopril
as outpatient. EKG without peaked T waves. Given diabetes and
proteinuria, patient was kept on lisinopril. His potassium
remained stable at 5.2 at time of discharge.
# Normocytic Anemia:
Suspect to be related to underlying CKD. Up to date on
colonoscopies and denying any melena or hematochezia. Hb stable
during hospitalization, at 9.9 at discharge. Iron studies
pending at time of discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES: ===============
#CKD: Cr remained around 2, at baseline.
#Hypertension: Continue anti-hypertensives as above
#Insomnia: Continue trazodone
#Anxiety: Continue sertraline
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
New Medications:
- Atorvastatin 80 mg PO/NG QPM
Changed Medications:
- Insulin Novolog 15U BID changed to sliding scale
[] Diabetes - insulin regimen changed to glargine 20U QHS and
Novolog ISS. Adjust as needed for better glucose control.
[] Hyperkalemia - consider decreasing lisinopril or increasing
HCTZ depending on BP
[] Type ___ NSTEMI - consider outpatient P-MIBI for further
evaluation
[] Anemia - follow up iron studies

Pertinent recent imaging:

Bilateral ___ US ___
IMPRESSION:    
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

CTA Chest ___
IMPRESSION:   
1. There is a re-demonstrated nonocclusive pulmonary embolism in 
the segmental branches of the left upper lobe as seen on the 
head and neck CTA performed earlier today.  No additional 
pulmonary emboli are visualized.  No imaging evidence of right 
heart strain. 
2. Emphysema. 
3. Additional findings above. 

CTA Head and Neck ___
IMPRESSION:   
1. Acute pulmonary embolus left upper lobe. 
2. Multifocal areas of intracranial arterial narrowing, may 
represent 
vasospasm,, differential diagnosis is vasculopathy. 
3. Grossly stable appearance following left craniotomy and 
decompression with persistent extracranial brain herniation.  
Minimal interval decreased size of rim enhancing left 
parenchymal subacute hematoma.  Follow-up recommended to 
document resolution. 
4. Stable mass effect, hydrocephalus. 
5. Multiple punctate infarcts are stable. 
6. Transverse sinuses better evaluated on prior MRI. 
7. No significant narrowing CTA neck. 
8. Diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, consider thyroiditis. 

MRI Head ___
IMPRESSION:    
Multiple punctate areas of restricted diffusion in the right 
temporal, 
parietal and frontal lobes in keeping with acute embolic 
infarcts.   
Filling defect in the left transverse sinus suggestive of dural 
venous sinus thrombosis, which is new compared to prior.   
The patient is status post left frontotemporoparietal 
decompressive surgery.  The hematoma is decreased in size and 
there is decreased mass effect.  The amount of transcranial 
herniated brain tissue is slightly increased compared to prior. 
There is two small rim enhancing extracranial collections 
anterior to the 
transcranial herniated brain tissue as described above.  These 
are nonspecific and may represent rim enhancing hematomas, but 
infection/abscesses should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis. 

Abominal US ___
IMPRESSION:    
Normal abdominal ultrasound. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year-old woman with HTN who presents 
with acute onset dizziness followed by fall found to have large 
left temporoparietal ICH at OSH that increased on repeat imaging 
here at ___ with rightward midline shift and subfalcine 
herniation, s/p decompressive craniectomy on the left ___. 

#Left Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage
The patient was transferred intubated from OSH with a left sided 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema. A repeat 
head CT was obtained upon arrival to ___ that showed worsening 
hemorrhage with increasing midline shift and herniation. A 
meeting was had with the family offering a surgical 
decompressive craniectomy as well as discussing her poor 
prognosis. It was decided to proceed with surgical intervention. 
She underwent an emergent left sided decompressive 
hemicraniectomy on ___ and was admitted to the Neuro ICU 
post-operatively for close neurologic monitoring. She was 
started on Keppra x7 days postop for seizure prophylaxis. Postop 
head CT showed minimal increase in IPH, with improved uncal 
herniation and MLS. She was started on 3% hypertonic saline for 
cerebral edema. She was maintained on hypertonic saline. 
Hypertonic saline d/c'd ___. CT torso was done to look for 
underlying malignancy, which was negative. MRI performed to look 
for underlying etiology of bleed, but was unrevealing. On ___, 
the patient underwent a NCHCT and a family meeting was held in 
the afternoon, in which patient's prognosis at this point was 
discussed. Repeat CT on ___ was stable. On ___, the staples 
from the incision were removed. On ___ patient was noted to 
have left arm, left shoulder twitching and was restarted on 
Keppra 1gm BID. She was placed on continuous EEG for 24 hours 
which showed continuous focal slowing over entire left 
hemisphere, no seizure activity. On ___, she was again noted 
to have facial twitching and left shoulder twitching, concerning 
for seizure activity. Keppra was increased to 1250mg BID and 
restarted on continuous EEG, which was negative for seizure 
activity. EEG was again DC'd on ___ and she was maintained on 
Keppra 1250mg BID. Patient's neurologic exam remained stable. 

#Embolic Infarcts /Dural venous sinus thrombosis
Neurology was consulted for new right MCA territory 
embolic-appearing infarcts and developing venous sinus 
thrombosis on MRI ___. Neurology recommended TTE with bubble, 
which identified no cardiac source of embolism.  Left transverse 
sinus VST is small and now flow limiting, thought to be related 
to pressure due to IPH and swelling. Anticoagulation was 
deferred. CTA Head/Neck from ___ showed multifocal cerebral 
arterial narrowing concerning for vasospasm vs vasculopathy. 
Cardiology was contacted regarding optimality of TTE study, who 
recommended obtaining a TEE, which would be a better study to 
further evaluate for possible source of emboli. Family 
discussion determined to not proceed with further workup of 
infarcts. 

#PE
The same CTA head/neck on ___ discussed above also showed a 
small PE in the left upper lobe. A CTA chest confirmed 
non-occlusive PE in left upper lobe, for which anticoagulation 
was deferred because of the IPH and the patient's respiratory 
status remained stable. LENIs were negative for DVT. She was 
closely monitored for physiologic signs of worsening of PE.

#Hypertension /Intermittent SVT 
SBP into the 170s, requiring nicardipine drip intermittently. 
Intermittently tachycardic, so given fentanyl boluses for 
discomfort and started on metoprolol 25mg Q8H for both blood 
pressure control and intermittent SVT. Lopressor was increased 
on ___ due to persistent tachycardia. Cardiology was consulted 
for recommendations regarding rate control; metoprolol was 
adjusted. 

#Respiratory Failure 
The patient was intubated on arrival and remained intubated 
during her ICU stay.  Mini BAL was performed on ___ gram stain 
grew GNR's. Cultures grew H flu, antibiotics narrowed to 
ceftriaxone completed on ___. She failed to be weaned from the 
ventilator and tracheostomy was placed on ___ and weaned off 
vent. On ___ patient required increased in secretions and 
required frequent suctioning. She was started on Glycopyrrolate 
with much improvement in secretions. She was noted to have 
yellow secretions on ___, sputum culture was collected. Final 
results were still pending on discharge however the patient's 
respiratory status was stable, WBC WNL, and patient afebrile. 
Repeat cultures may be followed-up on as an outpatient if 
needed.

#Thrombocytopenia 
Per PMD documentation, patient had recent weight loss; could not 
obtain recent bloodwork from PCP. Some hematologic abnormalities 
were noted, including thrombocytopenia. On admission platelets 
100, trended down to ___. She did not require transfusion and 
platelet count improved. Outpatient heme records received, show 
mild baseline elevation of MCV and thrombocytopenia which was 
being monitored outpatient.

#Nutrition
OGT was placed. Tube feeds were at goal, and on ___ she was 
noted to have hypophosphatemia; concern for refeeding syndrome 
so decreased rate of tube feeds and repleted electrolytes, 
contact dietary for tube feeding recommendations. They 
recommended titrating up on tube feeds very slowly and repleting 
electrolytes as needed. Thiamine and folate were added. On 
___, the patient underwent placement of a PEG tube. Tube feeds 
were restarted Jevity 1.2 cal. Due to an uptrending serum 
calcium level, tube feeds were changed to Glucerna 1.2 cal on 
___. She was noted to have skin breakdown at the PEG site with 
ulceration and ACS was made aware on ___ and they placed a 2x2 
gauze under the bumper. ACS was paged again to re-evaluate the 
PEG site as 2 sutures remained in place on ___ and patient 
continued with skin breakdown despite 2x2 gauze. 2 sutures were 
removed and the bumper to the PEG was rotated. It was 
recommended to leave open to air or use a thin gauze if a 
dressing was indicated. 

#Fever
The patient was febrile intermittently during her ICU stay and 
was pancultured.  Mini BAL on ___ with GNR's on gram stain. She 
was started empirically on vanc/cefepime on ___. Patient with 
sputum cultures grew H.influenzae and completed course of 
ceftriaxone on ___. On ___ patient was febrile up to 102.4, 
urinalysis, chest xray and LENIs were negative. Obtained blood 
cultures, PICC line removed and tip of catheter was cultured. On 
___ patient persisted with fevers up to 101.9. Infectious 
disease was consulted for further management, Vancomycin and 
cefepime was started. Two Sputum cultures was obtained, which 
were both contaminated with respiratory flora. An induced sputum 
culture, suctioned from trach site was obtained, which... She 
was febrile again on ___, and UA/CXR were ordered, both 
negative for acute process. On ___ ID recommended 
discontinuation of antibiotics with close monitoring, for 
possible drug fever. She continued to be febrile after 
antibiotics discontinued. MRI was obtained ___ which was 
negative for infection but showed right embolic infarcts and a 
developing dural venous sinus thrombosis. Once PE identified, it 
was determined that is the likely cause of her intermittent 
fevers. No further fever workup obtained. 

#Mucous Plug 
Patient underwent a CTA Chest to rule out pulmonary embolism on 
___ which revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and new 
focally dilated subsegmental bronchus in the right lower lobe 
with distal nodular opacification possibly reflecting mucous 
plugging within the distal airway and upstream dilatation. Chest 
physiotherapy and aggressive suctioning ordered, the patients 
respiratory status remained stable on discharge. 

#Elevated LFTs
Medicine was consulted for elevated ALT/Lipase/Amylase in the 
setting of fever on ___, who recommended Hepatitis B/C 
serology, Fe/Ferritin/TIBC, TSH/Free T4, and a RUQ ultrasound as 
workup. Aside from a slightly elevated Ferritin, this workup was 
overall negative for any acute/subacute hepatic process, and the 
elevated LFTs were stable on ___. This was attributed to a 
medication effect, likely either beta-blocker or cephalosporin.

#Dispo
Patient was evaluated by ___ and OT who recommended rehab.

Pertinent recent imaging:
Bilateral ___ US ___
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower
extremity
veins.
CTA Chest ___
IMPRESSION:
1. There is a re-demonstrated nonocclusive pulmonary embolism in
the segmental branches of the left upper lobe as seen on the
head and neck CTA performed earlier today. No additional
pulmonary emboli are visualized. No imaging evidence of right
heart strain.
2. Emphysema.
3. Additional findings above.
CTA Head and Neck ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pulmonary embolus left upper lobe.
2. Multifocal areas of intracranial arterial narrowing, may
represent
vasospasm,, differential diagnosis is vasculopathy.
3. Grossly stable appearance following left craniotomy and
decompression with persistent extracranial brain herniation.
Minimal interval decreased size of rim enhancing left
parenchymal subacute hematoma. Follow-up recommended to
document resolution.
4. Stable mass effect, hydrocephalus.
5. Multiple punctate infarcts are stable.
6. Transverse sinuses better evaluated on prior MRI.
7. No significant narrowing CTA neck.

infarcts.
Filling defect in the left transverse sinus suggestive of dural
venous sinus thrombosis, which is new compared to prior.
The patient is status post left frontotemporoparietal
decompressive surgery. The hematoma is decreased in size and
there is decreased mass effect. The amount of transcranial
herniated brain tissue is slightly increased compared to prior.
There is two small rim enhancing extracranial collections
anterior to the
transcranial herniated brain tissue as described above. These
are nonspecific and may represent rim enhancing hematomas, but
infection/abscesses should be considered in the differential
diagnosis.
Abominal US ___
IMPRESSION:
Normal abdominal ultrasound.
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year-old woman with HTN who presents
with acute onset dizziness followed by fall found to have large
left temporoparietal ICH at OSH that increased on repeat imaging
here at ___ with rightward midline shift and subfalcine
herniation, s/p decompressive craniectomy on the left ___.
#Left Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage
The patient was transferred intubated from OSH with a left sided
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema. A repeat
head CT was obtained upon arrival to ___ that showed worsening
hemorrhage with increasing midline shift and herniation. A
meeting was had with the family offering a surgical
decompressive craniectomy as well as discussing her poor
prognosis. It was decided to proceed with surgical intervention.
She underwent an emergent left sided decompressive
hemicraniectomy on ___ and was admitted to the Neuro ICU
post-operatively for close neurologic monitoring. She was
started on Keppra x7 days postop for seizure prophylaxis. Postop
head CT showed minimal increase in IPH, with improved uncal
herniation and MLS. She was started on 3% hypertonic saline for
cerebral edema. She was maintained on hypertonic saline.
Hypertonic saline d/c'd ___. CT torso was done to look for
underlying malignancy, which was negative. MRI performed to look
for underlying etiology of bleed, but was unrevealing. On ___,
the patient underwent a NCHCT and a family meeting was held in
the afternoon, in which patient's prognosis at this point was
discussed. Repeat CT on ___ was stable. On ___, the staples
from the incision were removed. On ___ patient was noted to
have left arm, left shoulder twitching and was restarted on
Keppra 1gm BID. She was placed on continuous EEG for 24 hours
which showed continuous focal slowing over entire left
hemisphere, no seizure activity. On ___, she was again noted
to have facial twitching and left shoulder twitching, concerning
for seizure activity. Keppra was increased to 1250mg BID and
restarted on continuous EEG, which was negative for seizure
activity. EEG was again DC'd on ___ and she was maintained on
Keppra 1250mg BID. Patient's neurologic exam remained stable.
#Embolic Infarcts /Dural venous sinus thrombosis
Neurology was consulted for new right MCA territory
embolic-appearing infarcts and developing venous sinus
thrombosis on MRI ___. Neurology recommended TTE with bubble,
which identified no cardiac source of embolism. Left transverse
sinus VST is small and now flow limiting, thought to be related
to pressure due to IPH and swelling. Anticoagulation was
deferred. CTA Head/Neck from ___ showed multifocal cerebral
arterial narrowing concerning for vasospasm vs vasculopathy.
Cardiology was contacted regarding optimality of TTE study, who
recommended obtaining a TEE, which would be a better study to
further evaluate for possible source of emboli. Family
discussion determined to not proceed with further workup of
infarcts.
#PE
The same CTA head/neck on ___ discussed above also showed a
small PE in the left upper lobe. A CTA chest confirmed
non-occlusive PE in left upper lobe, for which anticoagulation
was deferred because of the IPH and the patient's respiratory
status remained stable. LENIs were negative for DVT. She was
closely monitored for physiologic signs of worsening of PE.
#Hypertension /Intermittent SVT
SBP into the 170s, requiring nicardipine drip intermittently.
Intermittently tachycardic, so given fentanyl boluses for
discomfort and started on metoprolol 25mg Q8H for both blood
pressure control and intermittent SVT. Lopressor was increased
on ___ due to persistent tachycardia. Cardiology was consulted
for recommendations regarding rate control; metoprolol was
adjusted.
#Respiratory Failure
The patient was intubated on arrival and remained intubated
during her ICU stay. Mini BAL was performed on ___ gram stain
grew GNR's. Cultures grew H flu, antibiotics narrowed to
ceftriaxone completed on ___. She failed to be weaned from the
ventilator and tracheostomy was placed on ___ and weaned off
vent. On ___ patient required increased in secretions and
required frequent suctioning. She was started on Glycopyrrolate
with much improvement in secretions. She was noted to have
yellow secretions on ___, sputum culture was collected. Final
results were still pending on discharge however the patient's
respiratory status was stable, WBC WNL, and patient afebrile.
Repeat cultures may be followed-up on as an outpatient if
needed.
#Thrombocytopenia
Per PMD documentation, patient had recent weight loss; could not
obtain recent bloodwork from PCP. Some hematologic abnormalities
were noted, including thrombocytopenia. On admission platelets
100, trended down to ___. She did not require transfusion and
platelet count improved. Outpatient heme records received, show
mild baseline elevation of MCV and thrombocytopenia which was
being monitored outpatient.
#Nutrition
OGT was placed. Tube feeds were at goal, and on ___ she was
noted to have hypophosphatemia; concern for refeeding syndrome
so decreased rate of tube feeds and repleted electrolytes,
contact dietary for tube feeding recommendations. They
recommended titrating up on tube feeds very slowly and repleting
electrolytes as needed. Thiamine and folate were added. On
___, the patient underwent placement of a PEG tube. Tube feeds
were restarted Jevity 1.2 cal. Due to an uptrending serum
calcium level, tube feeds were changed to Glucerna 1.2 cal on
___. She was noted to have skin breakdown at the PEG site with
ulceration and ACS was made aware on ___ and they placed a 2x2
gauze under the bumper. ACS was paged again to re-evaluate the
PEG site as 2 sutures remained in place on ___ and patient
continued with skin breakdown despite 2x2 gauze. 2 sutures were
removed and the bumper to the PEG was rotated. It was
recommended to leave open to air or use a thin gauze if a
dressing was indicated.
#Fever
The patient was febrile intermittently during her ICU stay and
was pancultured. Mini BAL on ___ with GNR's on gram stain. She
was started empirically on vanc/cefepime on ___. Patient with
sputum cultures grew H.influenzae and completed course of
ceftriaxone on ___. On ___ patient was febrile up to 102.4,
urinalysis, chest xray and LENIs were negative. Obtained blood
cultures, PICC line removed and tip of catheter was cultured. On
___ patient persisted with fevers up to 101.9. Infectious
disease was consulted for further management, Vancomycin and
cefepime was started. Two Sputum cultures was obtained, which
were both contaminated with respiratory flora. An induced sputum
culture, suctioned from trach site was obtained, which... She
was febrile again on ___, and UA/CXR were ordered, both
negative for acute process. On ___ ID recommended
discontinuation of antibiotics with close monitoring, for
possible drug fever. She continued to be febrile after
antibiotics discontinued. MRI was obtained ___ which was
negative for infection but showed right embolic infarcts and a
developing dural venous sinus thrombosis. Once PE identified, it
was determined that is the likely cause of her intermittent
fevers. No further fever workup obtained.
#Mucous Plug
Patient underwent a CTA Chest to rule out pulmonary embolism on
___ which revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and new
focally dilated subsegmental bronchus in the right lower lobe
with distal nodular opacification possibly reflecting mucous
plugging within the distal airway and upstream dilatation. Chest
physiotherapy and aggressive suctioning ordered, the patients
respiratory status remained stable on discharge.
#Elevated LFTs
Medicine was consulted for elevated ALT/Lipase/Amylase in the
setting of fever on ___, who recommended Hepatitis B/C
serology, Fe/Ferritin/TIBC, TSH/Free T4, and a RUQ ultrasound as
workup. Aside from a slightly elevated Ferritin, this workup was
overall negative for any acute/subacute hepatic process, and the
elevated LFTs were stable on ___. This was attributed to a
medication effect, likely either beta-blocker or cephalosporin.
#Dispo
Patient was evaluated by ___ and OT who recommended rehab.

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY (___): As compared to the previous 
radiograph on ___, the patient has developed a left lower 
lobe opacity with air bronchograms, located in the lower lobe 
and better appreciated on the frontal than on the lateral 
radiograph. In the appropriate clinical context, this change 
represents pneumonia. At the time of observation, 11:02 on ___, the referring physician, ___, was 
contacted by telephone and the findings were subsequently 
discussed. Otherwise, there is no relevant change. Constant mild 
cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but without 
pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions. Unchanged mild 
mediastinal widening, potentially caused by a retrosternal 
goiter.
.
AP PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY (___): As compared to the previous 
radiograph, there is evidence of newly appeared parenchymal 
opacities at the lung bases, left more than right. The 
distribution suggests aspiration or pneumonia. No other changes.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with h/o mental retardation, HTN, prostate and colon ca, 
DM2, CKD (bl Cr 1.5) p/w shortness of breath, hypoxia, cough and 
e/o pneumonia on CXR.
.  
# DYSPNEA, HYPOXIA, COUGH: CXR on admission showed new LLL 
opacity with air bronchograms, making pneumonia most likely 
diagnosis. Patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime for 
coverage of HCAP, and albuterol + tiotropium given wheezing on 
exam. Initially he improved clinically and was afebrile; however 
on HD #3 he became febrile to 100.4 and clinically worsened with 
increasing dyspnea and lethargy and rising pCO2 on ABG. There 
was concern by team that he was aspirating given his lethargy 
while on regular diet. Therefore IV Flagyl was added to regimen 
to cover for aspiration pneumonia. He was also started on 
humidified O2 and frequent suctioning. With these interventions, 
he improved clinically with less hypoxia and decreased lethargy, 
and no longer spiked any fevers. Blood, urine and sputum 
cultures were all negative. Given negative sputum, Vancomycin 
was discontinued. Once he remained stable, he was transitioned

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY (___): As compared to the previous
radiograph on ___, the patient has developed a left lower
lobe opacity with air bronchograms, located in the lower lobe
and better appreciated on the frontal than on the lateral
radiograph. In the appropriate clinical context, this change
represents pneumonia. At the time of observation, 11:02 on ___, the referring physician, ___, was
contacted by telephone and the findings were subsequently
discussed. Otherwise, there is no relevant change. Constant mild
cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but without
pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. Unchanged mild
mediastinal widening, potentially caused by a retrosternal
goiter.

___ yo M with h/o mental retardation, HTN, prostate and colon ca,
DM2, CKD (bl Cr 1.5) p/w shortness of breath, hypoxia, cough and
e/o pneumonia on CXR.
.
# DYSPNEA, HYPOXIA, COUGH: CXR on admission showed new LLL
opacity with air bronchograms, making pneumonia most likely
diagnosis. Patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime for
coverage of HCAP, and albuterol + tiotropium given wheezing on
exam. Initially he improved clinically and was afebrile; however
on HD #3 he became febrile to 100.4 and clinically worsened with
increasing dyspnea and lethargy and rising pCO2 on ABG. There
was concern by team that he was aspirating given his lethargy
while on regular diet. Therefore IV Flagyl was added to regimen
to cover for aspiration pneumonia. He was also started on
humidified O2 and frequent suctioning. With these interventions,
he improved clinically with less hypoxia and decreased lethargy,
and no longer spiked any fevers. Blood, urine and sputum
cultures were all negative. Given negative sputum, Vancomycin
was discontinued. Once he remained stable, he was transitioned
to PO Levoquin and PO Flagyl to complete total 7-day antibiotic
course on ___.

K-3.8 Cl-101 HCO3-25 AnGap-___ year old Male with a history of chronic stable Asthma  who 
presents with 24 hours of progressive dyspnea and wheezing 
consistent with an asthma exacerbation.

Assessment and Plan:
# Chronic Stable Asthma with severe acute exacerbation: Patient 
presents with shortness of breath, and significant wheezing with 
accessory muscle use consistent with an acute asthma 
exacerbation. Patient meets criteria for a severe exacerbation 
due to RR>30 in the ED, and patient required a 100% NRB mask 
during transport.  Given the patient's symptoms likely 
represents a viral bronchitis type trigger. He was started on 
Prednisone 60 mg p.o. daily and standing nebs until his 
breathing improved and will taper his predniosone 10mg every 
other day on discharge. HIs peakflows improved to 220-285 (at or 
above baseline per patient) and he had spirometry while in the 
hospital as well. He will follow up with his pulmonologist and 
PCP as an outpatient. 

# HTN: 
- Continued amlodipine

# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is not on a rate control agent. 
He presented with RVR in the setting of nebs but that resolved 
with improved respiroaty status. Continued rivoroxaban

# Hyperlipidemia
- Continued Pravachol

# QT Prolongation: Resolved. Note patient has a QTc > 500 on EKG 
in ED. His baseline on prior EKGs is normal at 430.  He was 
monitored on telemetry and repeat EKGs over the following 2 days 
showed a reduction in his QTC down to 450. Bupropion is a QT
prolonging agent, but wish to avoid stopping this in the setting 
of increased anxiety with steroids.  He should have follow-up 
EKGs as an outpatient to continue to monitor his QTC but 
discharge QTc 450. 

Transitional Issues:
[] Follow up QTc on EKG as an outpatient. 
[] Evaluate for the need to prolong his steroid course. 

Greater than 30 minutes spent in care coordination and 
counseling on the day of discharge.

Initial vitals in the ED were 98.4, 102, 147/97, 34, 98%.
Patient was triggered in the ED for respiratory distress.
Initial peak flow was 170 (although on ED dash somewhat
confusing that the pre-treatment is displayed at 150 after the
post which was 170). The patient received multiple doses of
albuterol, Magnesium sulfate and ipratropium along with 1L of

K-3.8 Cl-101 HCO3-25 AnGap-___ year old Male with a history of chronic stable Asthma who
presents with 24 hours of progressive dyspnea and wheezing
consistent with an asthma exacerbation.
Assessment and Plan:
# Chronic Stable Asthma with severe acute exacerbation: Patient
presents with shortness of breath, and significant wheezing with
accessory muscle use consistent with an acute asthma
exacerbation. Patient meets criteria for a severe exacerbation
due to RR>30 in the ED, and patient required a 100% NRB mask
during transport. Given the patient's symptoms likely
represents a viral bronchitis type trigger. He was started on
Prednisone 60 mg p.o. daily and standing nebs until his
breathing improved and will taper his predniosone 10mg every
other day on discharge. HIs peakflows improved to 220-285 (at or
above baseline per patient) and he had spirometry while in the
hospital as well. He will follow up with his pulmonologist and
PCP as an outpatient.
# HTN:
- Continued amlodipine
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is not on a rate control agent.
He presented with RVR in the setting of nebs but that resolved
with improved respiroaty status. Continued rivoroxaban
# Hyperlipidemia
- Continued Pravachol
# QT Prolongation: Resolved. Note patient has a QTc > 500 on EKG
in ED. His baseline on prior EKGs is normal at 430. He was
monitored on telemetry and repeat EKGs over the following 2 days
showed a reduction in his QTC down to 450. Bupropion is a QT
prolonging agent, but wish to avoid stopping this in the setting
of increased anxiety with steroids. He should have follow-up
EKGs as an outpatient to continue to monitor his QTC but
discharge QTc 450.
Transitional Issues:
[] Follow up QTc on EKG as an outpatient.
[] Evaluate for the need to prolong his steroid course.
Greater than 30 minutes spent in care coordination and
counseling on the day of discharge.

___ with h/o recurrent atrial fibrillation, CAD, hyperlipidemia,
who was transferred from ___ for possible dofetilide
induction vs ablation after bradycardia on sotalol.
.
#. Rhythm: The patient was admitted after recurrent and
increasing episodes of afib brought him to OSH for antiarrythmic
therapy. The patient was trialed on initiation of sotalol at the
OSH but this was discontinued ___ bradycardia. The patient was
in NSR during his whole hospitalization at ___. He was initiated
on dofetilide and received 6 doses while at the hospital. His
QTC was monitored. Of note he has a widened QRS and this was
allowed a QTC up to 520. His maximum QTC during the admission
was 486. The patient was stopped on HCTZ due to receiving the
dofetilide. His INR was subtherapeutic due to being given the
incorrect dosing of coumadin. This error was fixed and he was
discharged on his home dose of coumadin with close INR follow
up.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ was admitted after recent left thigh rash that had 
resolved prior to hospitalization. Outpatient lyme serologies 
negative. Worsening HA at home and c/f neck stiffness prompted 
presentation. Reports HA distinct from migraines. On arrival, 
she received CTX that was c/b allergic reaction requiring epi 
pen as well as vanco and acyclovir for empiric coverage of 
meningitis. On hospital day 1, she underwent LP that showed 2 
total nucleated cells, ruling out meningitis. ID was consulted 
and felt her presentation could still be consistent with early 
CNS Lyme disease inspite of negative serologies outpatient. 
Recommended continued doxycycline with meals to reduce 
nausea/vomiting patient was experiencing at home with 
medication. CSF studies for lyme, eneterovirus and arbovirus 
pending at time of discharge. 

# Headache/Neck pain: Patient presenting with headache and 
posterior neck pain, as well as reported subjective fevers at 
home, although she is afebrile here. Patient does have history 
of migraines, although she describes her current headache as
distinct from typical migraine phenotype. patient with 
tenderness to palpation over paraspinal muscles also suggesting 
possible muscle spasm as etiology. CTA head without acute 
process. Meningitis is possible, although she is well-appearing, 
afebrile, and has equivocal meningismus on exam; LP could not be 
obtained
in ED. Pt initially started on vanc/acyclovir after CTX 
reaction, however, given low concern for meningitis on exam 
(unilateral neck pain more c/w MSK, oriented x3, full ROM of 
neck), antibiotics were discontinued and she was placed back on 
PO doxycycline. 

# Rash: Resolved. Patient with rash on left thigh, now resolved. 
Lyme serologies negative. Lyme serologies were resent and 
pending at time of discharge as false negatives are possible. 
Restarted and discharged on PO doxycycline.

Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history of NIDDM who
presents as transfer from ___ with left chest pain 5 
days
after a fall with CT findings notable for L rib fractures and
small L pneumothorax.  

Patient reports that 5 days prior to presentation, he was 
tilling
the soil (""dethatching"") of his son's lawn and walking backward
in doing so when he tripped over one granite block and fell on
another, striking the left side of his body. He denies 
headstrike
and denies LOC and has complete recall of the event.  He had
severe immediate left chest pain and shortness of breath, and
states that he took approximately 5 minutes to catch his breath. 

Following this, however, he was able to get up and states that 
he
actually continued dethatching the lawn for the next 4 hours.  

His pain persisted for the next 5 days and ultimately his wife
convinced him to come into urgent care today, whereupon he was
referred to ___ and underwent imaging with left chest
findings as stated above (also see CT reports below).  He was
then referred to ___ for further evaluation.  

On presentation, he states that he is feeling generally well and
has no shortness of breath. He denies any fevers / chills /
nausea / emesis.  His pain is currently minimal but becomes 
worse
with movement.  He does also feel a twinge of pain with 
extremely
deep inspiration.  He was provided in the ED with an incentive
spirometer and is managing to inhale volumes in excess of 2
liters with minimal difficulty.

cyst. The spleen, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and adrenals are
otherwise unremarkable.
- AXILLAE: No axillary adenopathy is identified.
- MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are degenerative findings in the spine.
There is calcification along the anterior longitudinal ligament.
There is a 8mm area of dense sclerosis in the T4 vertebral body,
likely representing a bone island. There are fractures of the
posterior left sixth through 10th ribs. There is also a fracture
of the 11th rib at its articulation with the spine.
- ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: There is chest wall emphysema associated
with the rib fractures.

IMPRESSION:

2. Moderate left pneumothorax.
3. Left chest wall emphysema.
4. Partial collapse of the basilar segments left lower lobe.
There is a 5 mm left upper lobe nodule.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male status post fall 5 days ago. CT scan notable 
for multiple left-sided rib fractures and moderately sized but 
potentially loculated pneumothorax. Patient evaluated by trauma 
surgery, admitted to their service for further monitoring, no 
chest tube recommended. The patient was hemodynamically stable. 

Pain was well controlled. During this hospitalization, the 
patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with 
respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively 
participated in the plan of care. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay. He was pulling ___ on the IS and oxygen was 93% on room 
air. On HD2, repeat CXR showed moderate to large left 
hydropneumothorax, unchanged from the prior study.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after a fall. Your chest x-ray and CT 
scan showed several fractured ribs on the left side and a 
partial lung collapse, from air collecting around the space of 
the lung (pneumothorax). You were monitored closely and a repeat 
x-ray showed the lung injury was stable and not expanding. Your 
pain is well controlled and you are breathing comfortably. You 
are cleared for discharge home to continue your recovery. You 
should get a repeat chest x-ray at your follow-up appointment 
with your PCP next ___.

*Please restart your metformin tomorrow ___. 

Your injury caused 6 rib fractures which can cause severe pain 
and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of 
the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a ___ year old female with past medical
history of recently diagnosed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, CHF,
GERD, and hypertension who was brought in by EMS with chest
pain.
 
The patient was laying in bed late last evening when she
began feeling pressure in her chest accompanied by
diaphoresis and lightheadedness. These symptoms were unremitting 
for a few hours, with no aggravating or relieving factors. She 
did not have radiation of her discomfort. This pressure was also 
giving her shortness of breath. She denies recent DOE, 
orthopnea, or PND. She has had no nausea or vomiting. 

She called EMS and was given sublingual nitroglycerine and 
aspirin by EMS in the ambulance with some relief of her 
symptoms. By the time she arrived at the ED, she was pain-free. 
She had troponins drawn that were negative, and an EKG showing 
t-wave inversions in all leads, otherwise no ST segment changes.

Of note, patient experienced similar pain last week while 
vacationing in ___. The patient reports that she was canoeing 
when she had chest pain and presented for evaluation at
___. She was found to have Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy and was anticoagulated and discharged home
after a clean cardiac catherization and an echo showing apical 
ballooning.

Patient is usually very active and has had a slight decrease in 
activity due to dyspnea; however, she can still walk many blocks 
before this happens.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of 
the distal septum and anterior walls and apex. The apex is not 
aneurysmal. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 
%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or 
with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild 
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild 
regional systolic dysfunction c/w distal LAD distribution. Mild 
mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Mild 
pulmonary artery hypertension. Trace aortic regurgitation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with Takotsubo CM ddx'd last week who presents with 
chest pain, negative trops and no specific EKG chagnes.

#chest pain: given her clean coronary angiogram the week before 
admission, and the fact that the pain was unremitting for four 
hours, not associated with exertion, and associated with diffuse 
T wave inversions without troponin elevations make this less 
likely for an ACS picture. This chest pressure likely represents 
a recurrence of her Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with some evidence 
of heart failure, with vascular congestion on CXR. 
Patient was given a 10ml IV dose of lasix, to which she diuresed 
about 2 liters of fluid. She denied any further chest pain in 
the hospital and did not have any symptoms of dyspnea, 
orthopnea, or PND.
An echo taken showed continued wall-motion abnormalities in the 
anterior and inferior walls of the left ventricle, with an EF of 
55%.
On discharge, she had no further pain or dyspnea, patient was 
given nitroglycerin for any further chest pain, as well as lasix 
to take to avoid further volume overload. Her lisinopril was 
increased to 10mg daily for afterload reduction. She was 
counseled to continue taking her coumadin and to follow up with 
her outpatient cardiologist.

#hyponatremia: likely representing hypervolemic hyponatremia; 
resolved spontaneously without any specific treatment. She did 
not have any symptoms from her hyponatremia.

Dear Ms. ___,
You were admitted for chest pain. After some tests we did, we 
determined that this is likely due to your takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy. You also had a bit of extra fluid in your body 
that we removed with the lasix medication.

If you have further episodes of chest pain, try nitroglycerin. 
If it continues, or if you have weight gain >3 lbs (current 
weight 120lbs) or shortness of breath, please call your doctor

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a ___ year old female with past medical
history of recently diagnosed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, CHF,
GERD, and hypertension who was brought in by EMS with chest
pain.
The patient was laying in bed late last evening when she
began feeling pressure in her chest accompanied by
diaphoresis and lightheadedness. These symptoms were unremitting
for a few hours, with no aggravating or relieving factors. She
did not have radiation of her discomfort. This pressure was also
giving her shortness of breath. She denies recent DOE,
orthopnea, or PND. She has had no nausea or vomiting.
She called EMS and was given sublingual nitroglycerine and
aspirin by EMS in the ambulance with some relief of her
symptoms. By the time she arrived at the ED, she was pain-free.
She had troponins drawn that were negative, and an EKG showing
t-wave inversions in all leads, otherwise no ST segment changes.
Of note, patient experienced similar pain last week while
vacationing in ___. The patient reports that she was canoeing
when she had chest pain and presented for evaluation at
___. She was found to have Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy and was anticoagulated and discharged home
after a clean cardiac catherization and an echo showing apical
ballooning.
Patient is usually very active and has had a slight decrease in
activity due to dyspnea; however, she can still walk many blocks
before this happens.

with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w distal LAD distribution. Mild
mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Mild
pulmonary artery hypertension. Trace aortic regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with Takotsubo CM ddx'd last week who presents with
chest pain, negative trops and no specific EKG chagnes.
#chest pain: given her clean coronary angiogram the week before
admission, and the fact that the pain was unremitting for four
hours, not associated with exertion, and associated with diffuse
T wave inversions without troponin elevations make this less
likely for an ACS picture. This chest pressure likely represents
a recurrence of her Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with some evidence
of heart failure, with vascular congestion on CXR.
Patient was given a 10ml IV dose of lasix, to which she diuresed
about 2 liters of fluid. She denied any further chest pain in
the hospital and did not have any symptoms of dyspnea,
orthopnea, or PND.
An echo taken showed continued wall-motion abnormalities in the
anterior and inferior walls of the left ventricle, with an EF of
55%.
On discharge, she had no further pain or dyspnea, patient was
given nitroglycerin for any further chest pain, as well as lasix
to take to avoid further volume overload. Her lisinopril was
increased to 10mg daily for afterload reduction. She was
counseled to continue taking her coumadin and to follow up with
her outpatient cardiologist.
#hyponatremia: likely representing hypervolemic hyponatremia;
resolved spontaneously without any specific treatment. She did
not have any symptoms from her hyponatremia.

IMAGING/REPORTS
===============
___ CTA:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection on this non gated study.  If 
a dissection is strongly suspected, a gated CTA of the ascending 
aorta should be performed.
2. Intramural hematoma can only be excluded on a non-contrast 
study.
3. There is dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta.  
Dilatation is most prominent at the aortic root/sinuses of 
Valsalva measuring 52 x 47 mm in diameter.  The sino-tubular 
junction measures 42 x 46 mm.  The mid ascending aorta measures 
50 x 46 mm.  Rest of aortic measurements as provided above.
4. Mild thickening of the right aortic valve leaflet 
(vegetations cannot be excluded).
5. Massive cardiomegaly.6. Bibasilar opacity, likely 
representing atelectasis.

TTE ___:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function 
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right 
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened (?#). There is a probable vegetation on the 
aortic valve measuring 0.7 by 0.4 cm. Given that it is unclear 
if this is a bicuspid vs a tricuspid valve the name of the 
particular cusp involved is unable to be determined (clips 39 
and 66). An echodensity is appreciated deep in the aortic root 
which may represent an aortic dissection flap in one view, but 
could not be confirmed in multiple views (clip ___. There is no 
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is 
likely related to high cardiac output and increased stroke 
volume due to aortic regurgitation. Severe (4+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen (clips 58, 59). The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic regurgitation in the presence of a 
possible aortic valve vegetation and unclear aortic valve 
morphology (?bicuspid vs tricuspid). An echodensity is noted in 
the aortic root (mildly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta) 
in one view which may be consistent with a possible dissection 
flap, however this finding was not able to be able to be 
confirmed in multiple views (clinical correlation is suggested). 
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Increased left 
ventricular filling pressure. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function.

TEE ___:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a moderate-sized 
strand-like vegetation (11x3 mm) on the noncoronary leaflet of 
the aortic valve that is seen to prolapse into the left 
ventricular outflow tract (clips 6, 18). There is an additional 
small oscillating vegetation (6x2 mm) on the right coronary 
leaflet (clips 6, 38). No aortic valve abscess is seen. The 
non-coronary leaflet appears fixed and immobile with severe (4+) 
centrally directed aortic regurgitation. There is descending 
thoracic aortic reversal of flow in late diastole consistent 
with severe aortic regurgitation and the aortic regurgitation 
vena contracta is 1.1 cm consistent with severe aortic 
regurgitaiton. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen 
on the mitral valve. No mitral valve abscess is seen. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. A tumor/mass is present on the 
tricuspid valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could 
not be determined. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic 
valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate and small vegetations on noncoronary and 
right coronary leaflets respectively with severe aortic 
regurgitation. No perivalvular abscess identified. Normal 
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Cardiac Cath ___:
No significant cardiac disease.

IMAGING/REPORTS
===============
___ CTA:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection on this non gated study. If
a dissection is strongly suspected, a gated CTA of the ascending
aorta should be performed.
2. Intramural hematoma can only be excluded on a non-contrast
study.
3. There is dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta.
Dilatation is most prominent at the aortic root/sinuses of
Valsalva measuring 52 x 47 mm in diameter. The sino-tubular
junction measures 42 x 46 mm. The mid ascending aorta measures
50 x 46 mm. Rest of aortic measurements as provided above.
4. Mild thickening of the right aortic valve leaflet
(vegetations cannot be excluded).
5. Massive cardiomegaly.6. Bibasilar opacity, likely
representing atelectasis.
TTE ___:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is a probable vegetation on the
aortic valve measuring 0.7 by 0.4 cm. Given that it is unclear
if this is a bicuspid vs a tricuspid valve the name of the
particular cusp involved is unable to be determined (clips 39
and 66). An echodensity is appreciated deep in the aortic root
which may represent an aortic dissection flap in one view, but
could not be confirmed in multiple views (clip ___. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output and increased stroke
volume due to aortic regurgitation. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen (clips 58, 59). The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic regurgitation in the presence of a
possible aortic valve vegetation and unclear aortic valve
morphology (?bicuspid vs tricuspid). An echodensity is noted in
the aortic root (mildly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta)
in one view which may be consistent with a possible dissection
flap, however this finding was not able to be able to be
confirmed in multiple views (clinical correlation is suggested).
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Increased left
ventricular filling pressure. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function.
TEE ___:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a moderate-sized
strand-like vegetation (11x3 mm) on the noncoronary leaflet of
the aortic valve that is seen to prolapse into the left
ventricular outflow tract (clips 6, 18). There is an additional
small oscillating vegetation (6x2 mm) on the right coronary
leaflet (clips 6, 38). No aortic valve abscess is seen. The
non-coronary leaflet appears fixed and immobile with severe (4+)
centrally directed aortic regurgitation. There is descending
thoracic aortic reversal of flow in late diastole consistent
with severe aortic regurgitation and the aortic regurgitation
vena contracta is 1.1 cm consistent with severe aortic
regurgitaiton. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. No mitral valve abscess is seen. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. A tumor/mass is present on the
tricuspid valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate and small vegetations on noncoronary and
right coronary leaflets respectively with severe aortic
regurgitation. No perivalvular abscess identified. Normal
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac Cath ___:
No significant cardiac disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with h/o GERD, HTN/HL, NIDDM, 
osteoarthritis/sacroiliitis who p/w tarry stools, with duodenal 
ulcers on EGD, now s/p endoclipping x2. 
-
#Melena: Patient with known h/o GERD and NSAID use p/w ___ 
well-formed, tarry stools per day x3 days in the setting of Hct 
of 26.6, down from 36.5 in ___, but otherwise asymptomatic and 
HD stable, and IV pantoprazole bid was initiated. On EGD on ___, 
she was found to have e/o gastritis, duodenitis, and 2 proximal 
duodenal ulcers, one with a clear vessel, but endoclipping was 
not attempted due to a paradoxical reaction to anesthesia, in 
which she became agitated, and pantoprazole bolus followed by 
drip was initiated at that time. After initial EGD, she received 
1u pRBC for Hct of 24.8, with appropriate bump to 29.5, prior to 
repeat EGD on ___, with endoclipping of both duodenal ulcers 
achieved at that time. She was continued on a pantoprazole drip 
for 72 hours, after which time PO pantoprazole bid was 
initiated, for a planned 8-week total course. She received an 
additional 2u pRBC for Hct of 24.3 3 days post-EGD, with 
appropriate bump to 31.2; anemia studies were difficult to 
interpret in the setting of acute GI bleed and transfusions, and 
repeat iron studies, with treatment as indicated, may be useful 
on PCP ___. She remained HD stable throughout, with the 
exception of transiently soft pressure to 99/52 in the setting 
of labetalol uptitration (see below), without recurrence of 
tarry stools for a few days by the time of discharge. 
-
#Hypertension: Patient with known h/o HTN p/w BP of 192/90 on 
arrival to the floor, likely due to missed doses of home 
antihypertensives in the ED, without symptoms suggestive of 
end-organ damage and with improvement to 150s-160s following 
early administration of evening labetalol. Although she 
continued to have infrequent SBP to 190s on the floor, 
invariably responsive to home labetalol, she otherwise remained 
in the 150s-160s, with the exception of SBP to 220 in the 
setting of epinephrine administration on repeat EGD ___, with 
improvement to 160s following 50mg IV labetalol. After trial 
increase in home labetalol from 100mg to 200mg bid, she remained 
largely normotensive with transiently soft pressure to 99/52, 
prompting reversion to home dosing, with SBP stably 100s-140s 
thereafter.
-
___: Cr was 1.3 on admission in the setting of poor PO intake, 
with return to baseline of 0.8-0.9 following IVF administration. 
Cr remained at baseline throughout admission on gentle 
maintenance IVF, which were discontinued once PO intake was 
adequate.
-
#NIDDM: Metformin was held on admission and FSBGs remained 
well-controlled in 100s, with infrequent 200s, on Humalog 
insulin sliding scale throughout admission, with return to 
Metformin planned at discharge. 
-
#HL: Home simvastatin was continued throughout admission.
-
#Osteoarthritis/sacroiliitis: Patient with h/o OA/sacroiliitis 
initially experienced chronic low back and hip pain on home 
regimen of hydrocodone-acetaminophen prn, perhaps because of 
difficulty remembering to request, with improved pain control on 
standing acetaminophen, with minimal prn oxycodone requirement. 
She underwent physical therapy for deconditioning on this 
admission, with continued ___ planned at rehabilitation.  
-
#Transitional Issues:
-Melena: Close GI ___ has been arranged. She should remain 
on bid pantoprazole for a total of 8 weeks, up to and including 
___. Iron studies were difficult to interpret on this admission 
in the setting of acute GI bleed and transfusion; reassessment 
of iron studies, with treatment as indicated, would be advised 
on PCP ___.
-HTN: She experienced labile SBP, 100s-190s, on her home 
antihypertensive regimen, with soft pressures on uptitration of 
labetalol and ultimate return to home dosing; PCP ___ is 
being arranged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with h/o GERD, HTN/HL, NIDDM,
osteoarthritis/sacroiliitis who p/w tarry stools, with duodenal
ulcers on EGD, now s/p endoclipping x2.
-
#Melena: Patient with known h/o GERD and NSAID use p/w ___
well-formed, tarry stools per day x3 days in the setting of Hct
of 26.6, down from 36.5 in ___, but otherwise asymptomatic and
HD stable, and IV pantoprazole bid was initiated. On EGD on ___,
she was found to have e/o gastritis, duodenitis, and 2 proximal
duodenal ulcers, one with a clear vessel, but endoclipping was
not attempted due to a paradoxical reaction to anesthesia, in
which she became agitated, and pantoprazole bolus followed by
drip was initiated at that time. After initial EGD, she received
1u pRBC for Hct of 24.8, with appropriate bump to 29.5, prior to
repeat EGD on ___, with endoclipping of both duodenal ulcers
achieved at that time. She was continued on a pantoprazole drip
for 72 hours, after which time PO pantoprazole bid was
initiated, for a planned 8-week total course. She received an
additional 2u pRBC for Hct of 24.3 3 days post-EGD, with
appropriate bump to 31.2; anemia studies were difficult to
interpret in the setting of acute GI bleed and transfusions, and
repeat iron studies, with treatment as indicated, may be useful
on PCP ___. She remained HD stable throughout, with the
exception of transiently soft pressure to 99/52 in the setting
of labetalol uptitration (see below), without recurrence of
tarry stools for a few days by the time of discharge.
-
#Hypertension: Patient with known h/o HTN p/w BP of 192/90 on
arrival to the floor, likely due to missed doses of home
antihypertensives in the ED, without symptoms suggestive of
end-organ damage and with improvement to 150s-160s following
early administration of evening labetalol. Although she
continued to have infrequent SBP to 190s on the floor,
invariably responsive to home labetalol, she otherwise remained
in the 150s-160s, with the exception of SBP to 220 in the
setting of epinephrine administration on repeat EGD ___, with
improvement to 160s following 50mg IV labetalol. After trial
increase in home labetalol from 100mg to 200mg bid, she remained
largely normotensive with transiently soft pressure to 99/52,
prompting reversion to home dosing, with SBP stably 100s-140s
thereafter.
-
___: Cr was 1.3 on admission in the setting of poor PO intake,
with return to baseline of 0.8-0.9 following IVF administration.
Cr remained at baseline throughout admission on gentle
maintenance IVF, which were discontinued once PO intake was
adequate.
-
#NIDDM: Metformin was held on admission and FSBGs remained
well-controlled in 100s, with infrequent 200s, on Humalog
insulin sliding scale throughout admission, with return to
Metformin planned at discharge.
-
#HL: Home simvastatin was continued throughout admission.
-
#Osteoarthritis/sacroiliitis: Patient with h/o OA/sacroiliitis
initially experienced chronic low back and hip pain on home
regimen of hydrocodone-acetaminophen prn, perhaps because of
difficulty remembering to request, with improved pain control on
standing acetaminophen, with minimal prn oxycodone requirement.
She underwent physical therapy for deconditioning on this
admission, with continued ___ planned at rehabilitation.
-
#Transitional Issues:
-Melena: Close GI ___ has been arranged. She should remain
on bid pantoprazole for a total of 8 weeks, up to and including
___. Iron studies were difficult to interpret on this admission
in the setting of acute GI bleed and transfusion; reassessment
of iron studies, with treatment as indicated, would be advised
on PCP ___.
-HTN: She experienced labile SBP, 100s-190s, on her home
antihypertensive regimen, with soft pressures on uptitration of
labetalol and ultimate return to home dosing; PCP ___ is
being arranged.

History of Present Illness:
___ year-old right-handed man with a history of reported coronary 
artery disease s/p CABG, dyslipidemia, and lymphoma, who 
presents as a transfer from ___ after presentation with 
vision loss and falls.  The history is obtained from the 
patient, who has some difficulty relaying the details, and 
available
documentation.

The patient reports that he was in his usual health until ~3 
weeks ago.  One day, while opening his eyes after showering, he 
found that he could not see from his right eye. The patient 
states that vision in his left eye was preserved.  He had 
difficulty reaching for objects in the right side of his field 
of vision.  The patient also states that he had several falls at 
that time, which he also attributed to his visual loss.  
However, over the following day, he reports that the vision in 
his right eye improved.  It remained ""blurred"" and did not 
entirely return to baseline.  He could see objects in front of 
the eye and could reportedly discern color.  He reports that he 
was assessed by his internist for these difficulties, and it was 
presumed that he had a ""stroke.""  Interestingly, he states this 
evening that he did not undergo imaging of his head at that time 
and no further evaluation or management was pursued.

At the time of the event above, he had developed a building, 
sharp, right-sided headache, located retro-orbitally and 
involving the frontal and occipital regions.  It does not seem 
to radiate elsewhere.  He states that he has had the pain daily 
since that time, lasting for the majority of each day.  Though 
he has had occasional associated nocturnal awakening, he denies 
changes with position or Valsalva.  He states that he also has 
associated neck discomfort, but denies a history of trauma or 
manipulation.

According to available documentation, he was ""last seen normal"" 
at ~9 pm on ___ evening.  However, he awoke on ___ 
morning at ~7 am and noted worsening ""blurred"" vision in his 
right eye.  Though he usually walked with a walker, he was 
having worsening trouble with ambulation; the patient states 
tonight that he had fallen.  Family was apparently concerned 
that he was confused and ""usually sharper"" than his current 
state.  Blood pressure was 124/92, pulse 84.  His pupils were 
""pinpoint.""  He was brought ___.  ___ 
physicians were concerned by the presence of ""medial rectus 
weakness"" on the right side.  There was no evidence of atrial 
fibrillation on EKG. CXR showed no pneumonia.  A head CT, which 
I reviewed here,
showed atrophy and a poorly defined low density region in the 
left parieto-occipital region, ~2 cm in diameter.  There was no 
hemorrhage.  He was sent to ___ for further evaluation.

Review of Systems:
Has had diarrhea for the past 4 months.  Family has told him 
that his speech is dysarthric, though he denies incomprehension. 
 He denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, focal weakness, 
numbness, tingling.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro - Patient was admitted to the General Neurology service.  
He was evaluated by ophthalmology who felt this was most 
consistent with a partial CN III palsy secondary to ischemia or 
inflammation.  Review of CT scan showed hypodensity in 
periaqueductal area, hypodensity in L temporal area c/w old 
infarct, and soft tissue mass around the foramen magnum.  
Sedimentation rate and CRP were nl.  Electrolytes within normal 
limits.  

Initially did not tolerate MRI x2 attempts.  Required MRI with 
anaesthesia to eval for ischemic process and to further evaluate 
soft tissue mass around foramen magnum.  There was some concern 
for lymphoma given h/o lymphoma to explain both soft tissue mass 
and possible infiltrating process.  

MRI/MRA brain, orbit and neck with and without contrast showed:
1. Enhancing soft tissue lesion at the skull base, surrounding 
the dens, with 
pre-contrast signal characteristics most consistent with fibrous 
tissue, 
including central focus of hypoenhancement. This appearance 
might be seen 
with crystalline arthropathy such as CPPD arthropathy, with 
pannus secondary 
to an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid or one of its 
variants 
(thought the pattern of dorsal involvement is atypical), or 
""pseudo- pannus"" 
due to osteoarthritis. Though there are erosive changes in the 
dens, 
pyogenic infection is considered less likely, as there is no 
visible fluid 
signal centrally; relatively ""indolent"" infection is an 
additional 
consideration. Lymphomatous involvement of the dura is a more 
remote 
possibility, particularly given that the patient has been ___ 
for several 
years, and also would also not readily explain the central 
hypoenhancement. 
  
2. Subacute infarction in the right midbrain, in the region of 
the 
periaqueductal white matter and median longitudinal fasciculus, 
likely 
explaining the recent symptoms. 
  
3. Extensive small vessel ischemic disease, atrophy, and old 
left 
frontotemporal infarct with likely prior laminar necrosis and 
dystrophic 
mineralization. 

Post anaesthesia, patient had quadriparesis and bilateral ptosis 
without any sensory findings.  Gradually improved over a few 
hours.  He received vecuronium during anaesthesia and was not 
reversed.  Likely weakness was secondary to vecuronium slow to 
wear off.  Did monitor in ICU overnight, following NIF and VC, 
in case of myasthenia but in the end did not think that this was 
the cause of his weakness.  

Neuro-oncology consulted.  He felt though unlikely soft tissue 
mass is lymphoma, cannot be fully ruled out.  Recommended LP for 
cytology, but patient and family declined both in discussion 
with neuro-oncology and with primary team. The very clearly said 
that they did not want any more tests, just wanted to go home.  
We did discuss findings during admission with his primary 
oncologist Dr. ___ will continue to follow the patient 
as an oupatient.   

Neuro-surgery involved.  Based on MRI findings did not recommend 
biopsy.  

___ cranial nerve palsy with limited adduction and upgaze of R 
eye and mild ptosis is likely fascicular.  MRI showing subacute 
infarct in R pariaquiductal area consistent with clinical 
course.  Started on aspirin.  Given poor heart function, further 
discussion regarding anticoagulation may be warranted, but 
family does not want any further interventions at this time.  
Also patient is a fall risk.  continued on lipitor.  

Further history indicated ___ h/o cognitive decline. As 
inpatient mild cognitive difficulties noted on MS exams.  RPR 
NR.  B12 and folate normal.  TSH 2.4.  Mental status

CV - Ruled out myocardial infarction and monitored on telemetry 
without events.  Aspirin 325mg daily was started.  Fasting lipid 
panel chol 102, HDL 38, LDL 51, trigl 66.  Urinanalysis and Utox 
negative.  TSH 2.4.  HbA1C was 7.5%, should be addressed as an 
outpatient.   Surface echocardiogram showed EF ___, moderate 
MR and TR, at least mild pulmonary artery hypertension.  
Patient was noted to be in mild acute renal failure likely due 
to prerenal azotemia which improved slightly with mild IV 
resuscitation.  His baseline creatinine per PMD office was 1.9.  
Creatinine 1.5 on discharge.  

Metabolic - He was started on thiamine, folate and multivitamin 
for history of daily alcohol use.  

Dispo planning - Physical therapy evaluated patient and 
recommended that he needs 24hr supervision.  Also home safety 
eval.  Family refused to have us help with arranging home 
services.  They are being arranged through his oncologist, Dr. 
___.  We confirmed that their office is indeed 
arranging services.  Family also wishes to investigate 
palliative care options, but does not wish to have consult while 
inpatient.  Case discussed with PMD and oncologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro - Patient was admitted to the General Neurology service.
He was evaluated by ophthalmology who felt this was most
consistent with a partial CN III palsy secondary to ischemia or
inflammation. Review of CT scan showed hypodensity in
periaqueductal area, hypodensity in L temporal area c/w old
infarct, and soft tissue mass around the foramen magnum.
Sedimentation rate and CRP were nl. Electrolytes within normal
limits.
Initially did not tolerate MRI x2 attempts. Required MRI with
anaesthesia to eval for ischemic process and to further evaluate
soft tissue mass around foramen magnum. There was some concern
for lymphoma given h/o lymphoma to explain both soft tissue mass
and possible infiltrating process.
MRI/MRA brain, orbit and neck with and without contrast showed:
1. Enhancing soft tissue lesion at the skull base, surrounding
the dens, with
pre-contrast signal characteristics most consistent with fibrous
tissue,
including central focus of hypoenhancement. This appearance
might be seen
with crystalline arthropathy such as CPPD arthropathy, with
pannus secondary
to an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid or one of its
variants
(thought the pattern of dorsal involvement is atypical), or
""pseudo- pannus""
due to osteoarthritis. Though there are erosive changes in the
dens,
pyogenic infection is considered less likely, as there is no
visible fluid
signal centrally; relatively ""indolent"" infection is an
additional
consideration. Lymphomatous involvement of the dura is a more
remote
possibility, particularly given that the patient has been ___
for several
years, and also would also not readily explain the central
hypoenhancement.
2. Subacute infarction in the right midbrain, in the region of
the
periaqueductal white matter and median longitudinal fasciculus,
likely
explaining the recent symptoms.
3. Extensive small vessel ischemic disease, atrophy, and old
left
frontotemporal infarct with likely prior laminar necrosis and
dystrophic
mineralization.
Post anaesthesia, patient had quadriparesis and bilateral ptosis
without any sensory findings. Gradually improved over a few
hours. He received vecuronium during anaesthesia and was not
reversed. Likely weakness was secondary to vecuronium slow to
wear off. Did monitor in ICU overnight, following NIF and VC,
in case of myasthenia but in the end did not think that this was
the cause of his weakness.
Neuro-oncology consulted. He felt though unlikely soft tissue
mass is lymphoma, cannot be fully ruled out. Recommended LP for
cytology, but patient and family declined both in discussion
with neuro-oncology and with primary team. The very clearly said
that they did not want any more tests, just wanted to go home.
We did discuss findings during admission with his primary
oncologist Dr. ___ will continue to follow the patient
as an oupatient.
Neuro-surgery involved. Based on MRI findings did not recommend
biopsy.
___ cranial nerve palsy with limited adduction and upgaze of R
eye and mild ptosis is likely fascicular. MRI showing subacute
infarct in R pariaquiductal area consistent with clinical
course. Started on aspirin. Given poor heart function, further
discussion regarding anticoagulation may be warranted, but
family does not want any further interventions at this time.
Also patient is a fall risk. continued on lipitor.
Further history indicated ___ h/o cognitive decline. As
inpatient mild cognitive difficulties noted on MS exams. RPR
NR. B12 and folate normal. TSH 2.4. Mental status
CV - Ruled out myocardial infarction and monitored on telemetry
without events. Aspirin 325mg daily was started. Fasting lipid
panel chol 102, HDL 38, LDL 51, trigl 66. Urinanalysis and Utox
negative. TSH 2.4. HbA1C was 7.5%, should be addressed as an
outpatient. Surface echocardiogram showed EF ___, moderate
MR and TR, at least mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
Patient was noted to be in mild acute renal failure likely due
to prerenal azotemia which improved slightly with mild IV
resuscitation. His baseline creatinine per PMD office was 1.9.
Creatinine 1.5 on discharge.
Metabolic - He was started on thiamine, folate and multivitamin
for history of daily alcohol use.
Dispo planning - Physical therapy evaluated patient and
recommended that he needs 24hr supervision. Also home safety
eval. Family refused to have us help with arranging home
services. They are being arranged through his oncologist, Dr.
___. We confirmed that their office is indeed
arranging services. Family also wishes to investigate
palliative care options, but does not wish to have consult while
inpatient. Case discussed with PMD and oncologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ initially presented to the ___ ED on ___ with 
abdominal pain. He was found to have an incarcerated incisional 
hernia at the site of his previous colostomy by CT scan. He was 
taken to the operating room overnight on ___ for a 
ventral hernia repair. For details of the operation, please see 
surgeon's operative report. He tolerated the procedure well and 
was extubated upon completion. He was subsequently taken to the 
PACU for recovery.

He was transferred to the surgical floor hemodynamically stable. 
His vital signs were routinely monitored and he remained 
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His previously created end 
ileostomy was functioning by POD1, productive of both stool and 
gas. His diet was therefore advanced, which he tolerated without 
abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. His foley was removed and 
he voided spontaneously. 

He was encouraged to mobilize out of bed and ambulate as 
tolerated, which he was able to do independently. His pain level 
was routinely assessed and well controlled at discharge with an 
oral regimen as needed. His JP drain continued to have 
serosanguinous output and was left in place on discharge with a 
plan for removal in clinic. 

On ___ (POD3), the patient was discharged home with 
follow-up scheduled with Dr. ___.

intravenously. No 
oral contrast was used. Sagittal and coronal reformatted images 
were 
obtained. 
 CTA OF THE CHEST: No filling defect is noted within the main 
pulmonary artery 
and its branches to suggest pulmonary embolism. The aorta has 
normal 
appearance with no acute pathology. Diffuse calcification of the 
coronary 
arteries are noted. Multiple nodes are noted in the mediastinum. 
The largest 
node is noted in anterior subcarinal space and measures 11 mm in 
short axis. 
Diffuse calcification of coronary arteries are noted. 4-mm 
pulmonary nodule 
is noted in the right upper lobe. Atelectatic changes are noted 
at the bases. 
Visualized part of the upper abdomen including the adrenal 
glands and the 
spleen are unremarkable. Pneumobilia is noted within the left 
biliary system.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an ___ year old woman with history of hypertension and 
dementia who presented with hypoxia of unknown etiology.  
 
Hypoxia/Shortness of breath: 
The patient was initially admitted to the MICU for hypoxia of an 
unclear etiology, and was quickly weaned from non-rebreather 
oxygen to room air. The patient was evaluated for pulmonary 
embolism by a CT angiogram which did not show any abnormalities. 
The pt did not have fever or leukocytosis and there was no 
evidence of consolidation on chest x-ray to suggest an 
infectious cause of hypoxia. The pt had an echocardiogram which 
showed an intra-atrial aneurysm with left-to-right shunting, but 
this did not seem like the likely source of the pt's hypoxia. 
Shunt unlikely, no significant atelectasis on CT, no history of 
AVMs. Cardiac biomarkers were cycled and the patient did not 
show any evidence (on EKG or cardiac enzymes) of coronary 
disease. On the floor the pt oxygenated well with no 
de-saturations on room air, and was able to ambulate without any 
desaturations on room air. Ultimately the patient's hypoxia was 
attributed either to a temporary mucous plug or to a transient 
aspiration pneumonitis.
.
Hypertension:
The patient was continued on her home medications: Atenolol 50 
mg daily, Norvasc 10mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. 
 
.  
Hypercholestermia: 
The patient was continued on her home dose of Crestor.  
.  
Dementia: 
The patient was confused in the ICU, and oriented only to self. 
Initially on the floor the patient was agitiated, trying to get 
out of bed. Given the family's concern that the pt's memory was 
not benefitting from Aricept and Namenda, and that the Aricept 
and Namenda were actually causing memory impairments, the 
Aricept and Namenda were discontinued. The pt was continued on 
her home doses of her anti-depressant medications venlafaxine 
and paroxetine.
.  
Chronic renal failure: 
The patient's creatinine was noted to be at baseline (1.2 to 
1.9) during this hospitalization. Nephrotoxins were avoided. 
.  
DNR/DNI:
The patient's code status was DNR DNI during this admission, and 
this was confirmed with the patient and her family. 
 
Medications on Admission:
Amlodipine 10mg daily  
Atenolol 50mg daily  
Aricept 2.5mg daily  
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 daily

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with shortness of breath and decreased oxygen 
saturation. You were transferred the the medical intensive care 
unit and quickly taken off nasal cannula oxygen. You had a 
normal chest xray that did not show pneumonia and you also had a 
normal CT scan of your chest that showed a small pulmonary 
nodule. You have not had additional shortness of breath in the 
hospital and your blood oxygen saturations have been normal. 
.
You have the below appointments, it is very important that you 
attend your follow-up appointments.
.
We have discontinued the Aricept and Namenda that you were 
taking, since your family did not think that you were 
benefitting from these medications.

Brief Hospital Course:
=================
HOSPITAL COURSE:
=================
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman w/ PMH of anemia, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, AAA 
s/p EVAR, GERD, EtOH cirrhosis, who presents as a transfer from 
___ for evaluation and management of bradycardia, course 
complicated by necrotic toe s/p amputation.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Peripheral vascular disease complicated by necrotic toe wound
s/p amputation: 
Patient has had significant left second toe pain and redness for 
the past several weeks, and was referred to hospital for 
possible toe debridement. Continues to report left foot pain 
associated with his wound. Likely ___ the setting of extensive 
lower extremity vascular disease. ABI: ""Moderate to severe 
aortoiliac stenosis resulting ___ severely reduced flow ___ the 
left toe and moderately reduced flow ___ the distal right lower 
extremity."" 

Podiatry was consulted and recommended amputation. His toe was 
amputated on ___. Vascular was consulted but differed on 
performing an angio but agreed with the toe amputation. Per 
vascular, if it does not heal well, then will consider BKA. 
Currently the foot is healing well. He was on 
Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Flagl from ___. The antibiotics were 
stopped once the margins were determined to be on pathology.   

# Macrocytic Anemia
Hb stable, but notable for an MCV of 94 on admission and a slow 
trend of increasing MCV to 101. Retic is high. Suspect the 
etiology is secondary to increased production of Retics (RDW 
also trended up) iso of either increased nutrition 
supplementation or resolution of anemia of inflammation s/p 
amputation and continued abx. MM effect is on the ddx but less 
likely based on the acuity. Discharge Hb: 9.9. Discharge MCV: 
102. 

# Capacity assessment/Code Status
There is a recurring theme of the family, particularly the son, 
being exceedingly difficult to contact ___ the past and present. 
However, we were able to get ___ contact with the daughter who 
gave consent for the procedures and stated that the brother 
""fell of the face of the earth"" and would be nearly impossible 
to get ___ touch with him. Attempts to contact pt's son were 
unsuccessful.  

Daughter was OK with Full code for the procedure and 
___ period and believes it is within pt's goals of 
care. Daughter will t/b with her mother and pt's ex-wife about 
code status. However, it appears that Mr. ___ has 
capacity, or at least capacity for most situations. There was 
some concern a few months ago when he developed a stroke and had 
AMS but that appears to be resolved now. 

During this hospitalization, Mr. ___ wanted to contact 
his friend ___. Unfortunately, we were unable to 
contact him as all Mr. ___ knows is that he lives 
somewhere on ___, ___. Mr. ___ 
stated that he would be okay with ___ as his 
healthcare proxy. Please follow up on contacting his friend if 
there is a concern about his capacity/need for a health care 
proxy.     

# Intermittent sinus pauses:
Sinus node dysfunction, possibly present as early as ___. With 
caveat of dementia, not apparently symptomatic. If becomes 
symptomatic will require PPM if within goals. He remained 
asymptomatic during this hospital course and cardiology felt 
that he was stable and did not require any intervention. Prior 
EKG's show junctional escape possibly present since ___ 
with sinus bradycardia ___ ___ otherwise. His home metoprolol 
was held during admission and on discharge.

# EtOH Cirrhosis:
Patient is unable to state when he was diagnosed with cirrhosis. 
Per chart review, cirrhosis is believed to be secondary to 
alcohol. Patient is also unable to say whether he has ever 
required a paracentesis, had a bleed from his GI tract, or taken 
lactulose, although based on his pharmacy fill records it 
appears that he took lactulose briefly ___ ___. Patient 
reports that he doesn't follow with a hepatologist and his 
cirrhosis is managed by his PCP. Patient is unable to remember 
the name of his PCP, but based on pharmacy fill records, is Dr. 
___. He was continued on lactulose 30mL TID. 

# Multiple Myeloma:
He was previously DNR/DNI/DNH on hospice services at ___ 
having decided to not continue chemotherapy for Multiple 
Myeloma. However, over time he gradually improved clinically and 
was discharged from hospice. Since then, per family, he was 
changed to full code. However, there have been no discussion to 
continue any further treatment. 
hx:
- IgG lambda Multiple Myelma ISS Stage III for which he was 
placed on hospice ___ ___. Discharged from hospice a few month 
ago. 
- S/p 8 cycles Bortezomib-dex ending ___
- S/p 13 cycles maintenance 
dx:
During this hospitalization: SPEP (MONOCLONAL IGG LAMBDA), UPEP 
(ABNORMAL BAND ___ BETA
REGION), Kappa/Labda ratio (0.39, kappa: 43.7, lambda: 111.7)

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# GERD: Increased home pantoprazole.

# HTN: Continued home lisinopril. Held amlodipine ___ setting of 
acute infection, bradycardia, restarted on discharge.

# Anxiety/depression: Continued home sertraline.

# ___ (RESOLVED)

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[ ] Please change dressing on ___ with dry sterile dressing. 
Examine for any signs of infection or poor wound healing. Call 
___ clinic if any concerns at ___. Otherwise, per 
podiatry no need for any other dressing changes until they see 
him at clinic on ___. 
[ ] Please set him up with an outpatient dentist appointment for 
removal of his tooth/teeth
[ ] Please consider contacting his friend ___ if you 
wish to consider an alternative HCP. See above. Currently HCP is 
son with daughter as alternative, but they can be very difficult 
to reach.

hypertension, hyperlipidemia, who presents as a transfer from ___ for evaluation and management of bradycardia.
The patient's history is limited as he is extremely hard of
hearing and does not have his hearing aids. Interview was
performed ___ writing, and still the patient is able to
communicate only a few details of his history. The patient had
developed a wound on the superior aspect of his left second toe
about one week ago and was started on cephalexin and doxycycline
as an outpatient. When his wound did not improve, he was seen by
his vascular surgeon (Dr. ___ and referred to the
___ on ___ for evaluation of necrotic second toe.
Initially, the plan was to admit to Vascular Surgery at
___
for debridement. ___ the ER at ___ of the left foot
were
unable to evaluate individual toes due to bony overlap, but
demonstrated diffuse demineralization and no soft tissue
swelling. CTA was obtained which demonstrated severe bilateral
lower extremity atherosclerotic disease. However, while ___ the
ER, it was noted that the patient was noted to be intermittently
bradycardic to the ___. EKG was obtained and demonstrated absent
sinus activity with junctional escape rhythm. As a result, the
patient was transferred to ___ ER for further management. Of

Brief Hospital Course:
=================
HOSPITAL COURSE:
=================
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman w/ PMH of anemia,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, AAA
s/p EVAR, GERD, EtOH cirrhosis, who presents as a transfer from
___ for evaluation and management of bradycardia, course
complicated by necrotic toe s/p amputation.
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Peripheral vascular disease complicated by necrotic toe wound
s/p amputation:
Patient has had significant left second toe pain and redness for
the past several weeks, and was referred to hospital for
possible toe debridement. Continues to report left foot pain
associated with his wound. Likely ___ the setting of extensive
lower extremity vascular disease. ABI: ""Moderate to severe
aortoiliac stenosis resulting ___ severely reduced flow ___ the
left toe and moderately reduced flow ___ the distal right lower
extremity.""
Podiatry was consulted and recommended amputation. His toe was
amputated on ___. Vascular was consulted but differed on
performing an angio but agreed with the toe amputation. Per
vascular, if it does not heal well, then will consider BKA.
Currently the foot is healing well. He was on
Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Flagl from ___. The antibiotics were
stopped once the margins were determined to be on pathology.
# Macrocytic Anemia
Hb stable, but notable for an MCV of 94 on admission and a slow
trend of increasing MCV to 101. Retic is high. Suspect the
etiology is secondary to increased production of Retics (RDW
also trended up) iso of either increased nutrition
supplementation or resolution of anemia of inflammation s/p
amputation and continued abx. MM effect is on the ddx but less
likely based on the acuity. Discharge Hb: 9.9. Discharge MCV:
102.
# Capacity assessment/Code Status
There is a recurring theme of the family, particularly the son,
being exceedingly difficult to contact ___ the past and present.
However, we were able to get ___ contact with the daughter who
gave consent for the procedures and stated that the brother
""fell of the face of the earth"" and would be nearly impossible
to get ___ touch with him. Attempts to contact pt's son were
unsuccessful.
Daughter was OK with Full code for the procedure and
___ period and believes it is within pt's goals of
care. Daughter will t/b with her mother and pt's ex-wife about
code status. However, it appears that Mr. ___ has
capacity, or at least capacity for most situations. There was
some concern a few months ago when he developed a stroke and had
AMS but that appears to be resolved now.
During this hospitalization, Mr. ___ wanted to contact
his friend ___. Unfortunately, we were unable to
contact him as all Mr. ___ knows is that he lives
somewhere on ___, ___. Mr. ___
stated that he would be okay with ___ as his
healthcare proxy. Please follow up on contacting his friend if
there is a concern about his capacity/need for a health care
proxy.
# Intermittent sinus pauses:
Sinus node dysfunction, possibly present as early as ___. With
caveat of dementia, not apparently symptomatic. If becomes
symptomatic will require PPM if within goals. He remained
asymptomatic during this hospital course and cardiology felt
that he was stable and did not require any intervention. Prior
EKG's show junctional escape possibly present since ___
with sinus bradycardia ___ ___ otherwise. His home metoprolol
was held during admission and on discharge.
# EtOH Cirrhosis:
Patient is unable to state when he was diagnosed with cirrhosis.
Per chart review, cirrhosis is believed to be secondary to
alcohol. Patient is also unable to say whether he has ever
required a paracentesis, had a bleed from his GI tract, or taken
lactulose, although based on his pharmacy fill records it
appears that he took lactulose briefly ___ ___. Patient
reports that he doesn't follow with a hepatologist and his
cirrhosis is managed by his PCP. Patient is unable to remember
the name of his PCP, but based on pharmacy fill records, is Dr.
___. He was continued on lactulose 30mL TID.
# Multiple Myeloma:
He was previously DNR/DNI/DNH on hospice services at ___
having decided to not continue chemotherapy for Multiple
Myeloma. However, over time he gradually improved clinically and
was discharged from hospice. Since then, per family, he was
changed to full code. However, there have been no discussion to
continue any further treatment.
hx:
- IgG lambda Multiple Myelma ISS Stage III for which he was
placed on hospice ___ ___. Discharged from hospice a few month
ago.
- S/p 8 cycles Bortezomib-dex ending ___
- S/p 13 cycles maintenance
dx:
During this hospitalization: SPEP (MONOCLONAL IGG LAMBDA), UPEP

# HTN: Continued home lisinopril. Held amlodipine ___ setting of
acute infection, bradycardia, restarted on discharge.
# Anxiety/depression: Continued home sertraline.
# ___ (RESOLVED)
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================

Examine for any signs of infection or poor wound healing. Call
___ clinic if any concerns at ___. Otherwise, per
podiatry no need for any other dressing changes until they see
him at clinic on ___.
[ ] Please set him up with an outpatient dentist appointment for
removal of his tooth/teeth
[ ] Please consider contacting his friend ___ if you

___: 14.9  PTT: 28.5  INR: 1.3

ECHO (TTE):
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are 
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A 
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic 
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc 
motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Normally-functioning aortic 
valve bioprosthesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild 
pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
severely stenotic native aortic valve has been replaced with a 
bioprosthesis. There has been some regression of LVH. Mitral 
regurgitation is better appreciated on the current study, but 
severity is likely similar. Pulmonary pressures are slightly 
lower today. The other findings are similar.  

CXR ___ to the prior examinations, there has been 
improved aeration of the left lower lobe. However, there is 
engorgement of the vascular pedicle with cephalization and 
indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature with an enlarging 
right pleural effusion, all consistent with congestive failure. 
There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta. Evidence of median 
sternotomy and prior valve replacement again noted. No 
pneumothorax is seen. The bones are diffusely osteopenic with a 
severe levoconcave scoliosis of the mid and lower thoracic 
spine. IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure with an enlarging 
right pleural effusion. Repeat radiography following appropriate 
diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.

CXR ___: There has been interval decrease in still 
moderate-to-large right pleural effusion. Small left pleural 
effusion is unchanged. Cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal wires 
are aligned. Patient is post AVR. Improved still very mild 
interstitial pulmonary edema.

CT/CTA head and neck: Patient is status post right sternotomy 
with surgical staples and prosthetic aortic valve.
In the limited axial images of the upper chest, there is 
moderate right pleural effusion, and mild left-sided pleural 
effusion, not completely assessed on the present study.

NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE HEAD: There is a large area of 
hypodensity with sulcal effacement in the right middle cerebral 
artery territory, in the frontal and temporal and parietal 
lobes, with mild mass effect on the right lentiform nucleus, 
without evidence of hemorrhage within. There is no significant 
shift of the midline structures. Prominent ventricles and extra- 
axial CSF spaces are noted elsewhere, related to age- 
appropriate parenchymal volume loss. The patient is status post 
bilateral cataract surgery.

The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are clear.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD and NECK ___:
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch, at 
the origins of the brachiocephalic trunk and left common carotid 
artery. The brachiocephalic trunk is tortuous in its course. The 
right common carotid artery is patent in its course. The right 
cervical internal artery is tortuous, with markedly medial 
course, posterior to the oropharynx, causing asymmetry of the 
oropharyngeal soft tissues. This needs to be kept in mind if any 
oropharyngeal interventions are contemplated. The left common 
carotid artery has a small focus of calcification, close to its 
bifurcation. The cervical and intracranial internal carotid 
arteries are patent. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted 
involving the cavernous segments of the internal carotid 
arteries, moderate on the right and mild on the left.

The A1 segment of the both anterior cerebral arteries is small 
in caliber on both sides with a slightly prominent infundibulum 
at the junction of the A1 and A2 segments on the left side. The 
middle cerebral arteries are patent on both sides. The vertebral 
arteries are patent throughout their course, from the origin. 
The left vertebral artery origin is tortuous. The right 
vertebral artery is slightly small in caliber and likely related 
to hypoplasia.

No focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion is noted. The basilar 
and posterior cerebral arteries are patent. Slightly prominent 
right superior ophthalmic vein is noted, however, there is no 
abnormal opacification of the cavernous sinuses on the present 
study. Hence, this may represent a normal appearance. 

The cervical internal carotid artery measures 5mm on the right 
and 4mm on the elft ___ at the elvel of C2.

The thyroid lobes are mildly enlarged and heterogeneous with 
hypodense lesions in both lobes, alrgest in the elft measuring 
1.3cm. There is mild dialtion of the lower cervicale sophagus 
with fluid within.
There is asymmetry of the oropharyngeal soft tissues, which is 
not adequatdely assessed, due to patient positioning.

Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the visualized 
upper thoracic and the cervical spine, not adequately assessed 
on the present study.

Patient is status post right sternotomy with surgical staples 
and prosthetic aortic valve. In the limited axial images of the 
upper chest, there is moderate right pleural effusion, and mild 
left-sided pleural effusion, not completely assessed on the 
present study. There is also increased attenuation in the lung 
apices with interstitial thickening, better evaluated on
dedicated chest imaging studies.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large right MCA territory infarct with sulcal effacement.
2. No significant mass effect.
3. Atherosclerotic calcifications involving the aortic arch, 
origins of the arch vessels. However, patent major arteries of 
the neck and head without focal stenosis or occlusion.
4. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion, mild on the left side 
and interstitial thickening not completely included on the 
present study.
5. Multilevel degenerative changes in the C-spine.
6. Markedly medial course of the cervical internal carotid 
arteries, just posterior to the oropharynx, which needs to be 
kept in mind if any interventions are contemplated in this 
location.
7. Incidentally noted is mildly enlarged, heterogeneous thyroid, 
with the largest nodule in the left lobe measuring 1.3cm. 
Thyroid needs further evaluation with ultrasound for better 
assessment.
8. Mildly dilated fluid filled lower cervical esophagus with 
thickened wall which can be due to achalasia and esophagitis or 
other causes. To correlate clinically.

Thyroid ultrasound ___: The right thyroid lobe measures 2.0 x 
2.2 x 5.3 cm. The left thyroid lobe measures 1.8 x 2.1 x 4.5 cm. 
There are multiple colloid cysts in both thyroid lobes, the 
largest of which is seen on the left and measures approximately 
1.5 cm in greatest dimension. There is a 0.7 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm 
mildly heterogeneous isoechoic nodule in the lateral aspect of 
the right thyroid lobe.   
Incidental note is made of an enlarged lymph node with internal 
architecture in the lateral aspect of the neck adjacent to the 
carotid artery and jugular 
vein. This lymph node measures 0.8 x 0.7 x 1.5 cm. No other 
pathologically 
enlarged lymph nodes are identified. A few other smaller 
subcentimeter mild heterogeneous nodules are identified in both 
thyroid lobes that do not demonstrate any specific worrisome 
intrinsic characteristics. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Bilateral colloid cysts and small subcentimeter nodules that 
do not 
demonstrate any specific intrinsic worrisome characteristics. 
2. Enlarged lymph node in the left aspect of the neck with 
abnormal internal architecture. 

Carotid U/S (repeated in ___ on ___ - no significant 
stenosis bilaterally. Formal report pending. (Carotids US ___: 
There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and less than 40% 
left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both vertebral 
arteries. ). 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro - The patient was admitted to the stepdown unit of 
Neurology for close monitoring of her neurological and 
cardiovascular status. She made a remarkable recovery making 
fluent and purposeful movements with the left hand and with only 
a residual pronator drift, a MRC 4+ hemiparesis, dense L facial 
droop, and slurred speech. She did neglect the R, but only 
mildly - later on it was only evident as tactile extinction on 
the L, and anosognosia with motor impersistance. She has 
hammertoes, but the R toe is downgoing and the L up on plantar 
reflexes. 

CARDIOV - Her newly diagnosed Afib was initially difficult to 
control with PRN IV medications as diltiazem and metoprolol, so 
she was started on a diltiazem drip. Her bloodpressure dropped 
and given her CHF only small IV fluid bolus were given. The next 
day cardiology was consulted and her lasix was held as 
cardiology thought she was not in significant CHF. She was 
restarted on the diltiazem drip and bolused more aggresively 
with fluids. She was transitioned to PO diltiazem over the 
weekend of ___, 25, 26. Her Lasix was resumed at 40 mg QD on 
___ due to clinically evident CHF. Her heartrate at time of 
discharge was 85-115, most measurements <100, and medications 
can further be adjusted in rehab. She does not need telemetry. 
Her PO diltiazem QID should be transitioned to slow release 
forms. 

ID - In the long ___ day weekend in the AM she was found to 
be mildly confused. U/A revealed a UTI, she was started on 
Bactrim. Note that this potentially interferes with her Coumadin 
and daily INR levels should be obtained. Bloodcultures were 
obtained for the remote possibility of endocarditis given her 
fairly recent AVR - they were negative. Finally, she was treated 
with Nystatin for thrush and with local erythromycin drops for 
conjunctivitis. 

GI - Speech and swallowing evaluation was done early during 
admission and repeated on the day of discharge. For the 
recommendations please refer to the ""face sheet"". She was on a 
bowel regimen during admission. 

FEN - She has needed K repletion repeatedly, and was kept on her 
home regimen of 20 mEq of KCl (PO). Please monitor closely. 

ENDO - Her insulin sliding scale and FSBG were d/c'd since they 
were normal. An ultrasound was made of the thyroid for the 
coincidental finding on conventional XRay. The ultrasound 
revealed trivial thyroid findings (see ""results"" section) but 
also revealed a heterogeneous lymphnode. This can be followed up 
on as an outpatient, via her PCP.

___: 14.9 PTT: 28.5 INR: 1.3
ECHO (TTE):
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Normally-functioning aortic
valve bioprosthesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___,
severely stenotic native aortic valve has been replaced with a
bioprosthesis. There has been some regression of LVH. Mitral
regurgitation is better appreciated on the current study, but
severity is likely similar. Pulmonary pressures are slightly
lower today. The other findings are similar.
CXR ___ to the prior examinations, there has been
improved aeration of the left lower lobe. However, there is
engorgement of the vascular pedicle with cephalization and
indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature with an enlarging
right pleural effusion, all consistent with congestive failure.
There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta. Evidence of median
sternotomy and prior valve replacement again noted. No
pneumothorax is seen. The bones are diffusely osteopenic with a
severe levoconcave scoliosis of the mid and lower thoracic
spine. IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure with an enlarging
right pleural effusion. Repeat radiography following appropriate
diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.
CXR ___: There has been interval decrease in still
moderate-to-large right pleural effusion. Small left pleural
effusion is unchanged. Cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal wires
are aligned. Patient is post AVR. Improved still very mild
interstitial pulmonary edema.
CT/CTA head and neck: Patient is status post right sternotomy
with surgical staples and prosthetic aortic valve.
In the limited axial images of the upper chest, there is
moderate right pleural effusion, and mild left-sided pleural
effusion, not completely assessed on the present study.
NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE HEAD: There is a large area of
hypodensity with sulcal effacement in the right middle cerebral
artery territory, in the frontal and temporal and parietal
lobes, with mild mass effect on the right lentiform nucleus,
without evidence of hemorrhage within. There is no significant
shift of the midline structures. Prominent ventricles and extra-
axial CSF spaces are noted elsewhere, related to age-
appropriate parenchymal volume loss. The patient is status post
bilateral cataract surgery.
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are clear.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD and NECK ___:
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch, at
the origins of the brachiocephalic trunk and left common carotid
artery. The brachiocephalic trunk is tortuous in its course. The
right common carotid artery is patent in its course. The right
cervical internal artery is tortuous, with markedly medial
course, posterior to the oropharynx, causing asymmetry of the
oropharyngeal soft tissues. This needs to be kept in mind if any
oropharyngeal interventions are contemplated. The left common
carotid artery has a small focus of calcification, close to its
bifurcation. The cervical and intracranial internal carotid
arteries are patent. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted
involving the cavernous segments of the internal carotid
arteries, moderate on the right and mild on the left.
The A1 segment of the both anterior cerebral arteries is small
in caliber on both sides with a slightly prominent infundibulum
at the junction of the A1 and A2 segments on the left side. The
middle cerebral arteries are patent on both sides. The vertebral
arteries are patent throughout their course, from the origin.
The left vertebral artery origin is tortuous. The right
vertebral artery is slightly small in caliber and likely related
to hypoplasia.
No focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion is noted. The basilar
and posterior cerebral arteries are patent. Slightly prominent
right superior ophthalmic vein is noted, however, there is no
abnormal opacification of the cavernous sinuses on the present
study. Hence, this may represent a normal appearance.
The cervical internal carotid artery measures 5mm on the right
and 4mm on the elft ___ at the elvel of C2.
The thyroid lobes are mildly enlarged and heterogeneous with
hypodense lesions in both lobes, alrgest in the elft measuring
1.3cm. There is mild dialtion of the lower cervicale sophagus
with fluid within.
There is asymmetry of the oropharyngeal soft tissues, which is
not adequatdely assessed, due to patient positioning.
Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the visualized
upper thoracic and the cervical spine, not adequately assessed
on the present study.
Patient is status post right sternotomy with surgical staples
and prosthetic aortic valve. In the limited axial images of the
upper chest, there is moderate right pleural effusion, and mild
left-sided pleural effusion, not completely assessed on the
present study. There is also increased attenuation in the lung
apices with interstitial thickening, better evaluated on
dedicated chest imaging studies.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right MCA territory infarct with sulcal effacement.
2. No significant mass effect.
3. Atherosclerotic calcifications involving the aortic arch,
origins of the arch vessels. However, patent major arteries of
the neck and head without focal stenosis or occlusion.
4. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion, mild on the left side
and interstitial thickening not completely included on the
present study.
5. Multilevel degenerative changes in the C-spine.
6. Markedly medial course of the cervical internal carotid
arteries, just posterior to the oropharynx, which needs to be
kept in mind if any interventions are contemplated in this
location.
7. Incidentally noted is mildly enlarged, heterogeneous thyroid,
with the largest nodule in the left lobe measuring 1.3cm.
Thyroid needs further evaluation with ultrasound for better
assessment.
8. Mildly dilated fluid filled lower cervical esophagus with
thickened wall which can be due to achalasia and esophagitis or
other causes. To correlate clinically.
Thyroid ultrasound ___: The right thyroid lobe measures 2.0 x
2.2 x 5.3 cm. The left thyroid lobe measures 1.8 x 2.1 x 4.5 cm.
There are multiple colloid cysts in both thyroid lobes, the
largest of which is seen on the left and measures approximately
1.5 cm in greatest dimension. There is a 0.7 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm
mildly heterogeneous isoechoic nodule in the lateral aspect of
the right thyroid lobe.
Incidental note is made of an enlarged lymph node with internal
architecture in the lateral aspect of the neck adjacent to the
carotid artery and jugular
vein. This lymph node measures 0.8 x 0.7 x 1.5 cm. No other
pathologically
enlarged lymph nodes are identified. A few other smaller
subcentimeter mild heterogeneous nodules are identified in both
thyroid lobes that do not demonstrate any specific worrisome
intrinsic characteristics.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral colloid cysts and small subcentimeter nodules that
do not
demonstrate any specific intrinsic worrisome characteristics.
2. Enlarged lymph node in the left aspect of the neck with
abnormal internal architecture.
Carotid U/S (repeated in ___ on ___ - no significant
stenosis bilaterally. Formal report pending. (Carotids US ___:
There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and less than 40%
left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both vertebral
arteries. ).
Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro - The patient was admitted to the stepdown unit of
Neurology for close monitoring of her neurological and
cardiovascular status. She made a remarkable recovery making
fluent and purposeful movements with the left hand and with only
a residual pronator drift, a MRC 4+ hemiparesis, dense L facial
droop, and slurred speech. She did neglect the R, but only
mildly - later on it was only evident as tactile extinction on
the L, and anosognosia with motor impersistance. She has
hammertoes, but the R toe is downgoing and the L up on plantar
reflexes.
CARDIOV - Her newly diagnosed Afib was initially difficult to
control with PRN IV medications as diltiazem and metoprolol, so
she was started on a diltiazem drip. Her bloodpressure dropped
and given her CHF only small IV fluid bolus were given. The next
day cardiology was consulted and her lasix was held as
cardiology thought she was not in significant CHF. She was
restarted on the diltiazem drip and bolused more aggresively
with fluids. She was transitioned to PO diltiazem over the
weekend of ___, 25, 26. Her Lasix was resumed at 40 mg QD on
___ due to clinically evident CHF. Her heartrate at time of
discharge was 85-115, most measurements <100, and medications
can further be adjusted in rehab. She does not need telemetry.
Her PO diltiazem QID should be transitioned to slow release
forms.
ID - In the long ___ day weekend in the AM she was found to
be mildly confused. U/A revealed a UTI, she was started on
Bactrim. Note that this potentially interferes with her Coumadin
and daily INR levels should be obtained. Bloodcultures were
obtained for the remote possibility of endocarditis given her
fairly recent AVR - they were negative. Finally, she was treated
with Nystatin for thrush and with local erythromycin drops for
conjunctivitis.
GI - Speech and swallowing evaluation was done early during
admission and repeated on the day of discharge. For the
recommendations please refer to the ""face sheet"". She was on a
bowel regimen during admission.
FEN - She has needed K repletion repeatedly, and was kept on her
home regimen of 20 mEq of KCl (PO). Please monitor closely.
ENDO - Her insulin sliding scale and FSBG were d/c'd since they
were normal. An ultrasound was made of the thyroid for the
coincidental finding on conventional XRay. The ultrasound
revealed trivial thyroid findings (see ""results"" section) but
also revealed a heterogeneous lymphnode. This can be followed up
on as an outpatient, via her PCP.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ yo female of ___ descent with no known 
psychiatry history who was brought to the ED by her mother and 
sister as they are concerned about her marked behavior, mental 
status changes and decreased level of functioning over the last 
___ years. The family reportedly brought her to the ED this 
morning under the pretext that she was being seen for her 
chronic neck and tooth pain which the patient has said is the 
result of a car accident she was in several years ago. They have 
not been able to verify that she had actually ever been in a car 
accident as the patient reports the accident happened and 
___ and believes the truck hit her car on purpose. Her 
family reports that the patient was ""fine"" until she went to 
medical school in ___ ___ years ago and ""there was a Hurricane 
and she got stuck there."" They are not clear but they think she 
completed one year of medical school but while there she 
reportedly started thinking and doing odd things. For example, 
while a full-time student there, she tried to open a Starbucks 
and approached the ___ of the medical school, asking him if he 
wanted to invest and going to the bank to try to secure a loan.
.
They report that she left medical school and when she returned 
to ___ in ___, they noticed that she had ""changed mentally"" 
and has been ""going down hill since."" They said that she is not 
able to hold or find a ""stable job"",that she is moody with 
extreme angry outbursts. Her parents were living in ___ 
they are now are living in ___ with the patient's older 
sister. However at one point the patient was living in ___ 
with her parents, they moved back to ___, and the patient 
remained living in ___ but was ultimately evicted for a 
number of reasons and ended up homeless. Per her sister while 
the patient was living in ___, she was ""doing chemical 
experiments with gasoline in the bathroom, putting dish-washing 
soap and water in the gas tank of her car and disconnected the 
exhaust pipes on the car."" She was homeless in ___, picking 
up strange men that she met on the Internet and had spent the 
night with some man. They expressed concern that she might be 
pregnant as she has been gaining weight, plus she has been 
trying to access her parents' social security checks. While in 
___ she was staying up all night, talking to all kinds of 
people in the apartment complex despite the landlord's warnings. 
She did teach for a year but lost the job. The patient's cousin 
who also lives in ___ became so concerned about her behavior 
that she put her on a plane back to ___ and the pt has been 
here since ___. 
.
Her sister said that why she brought her into the ED today is 
because her behavior has been more concerning and bizarre over 
the past 2 weeks. She said the patient has been posting strange 
messages on Facebook and most recently she posted that she had 
""scheduled a Hindu cremation ceremony-I am going to need the 
next life to right what was stolen from me in this life--now 
where's my refund check."" Her sister said, ""I am afraid that she 
is suicidal."" Her mother reported that the patient sometimes 
wakes up in the morning ""screaming, leaves the house, and 
returns 2 hours later as if nothing has happened."" Her sister 
said that the patient has been using vinegar for everything from 
bathing to drinking it and tried to clean her sister's apt with 
it. Her sister said that at one point she thought that a black 
van or a helicopter was following her. Her sister brought with 
her extensive documentation of what has been happening with the 
patient and had downloaded patient's postings on Facebook.
.
Upon evaluation the patient was disorganized, kept apologizing 
as she said ""I'm slow"" and kept referring back to the car 
accident she had been in several years ago which has not been 
verified. And then said that she had been in a bus accident ___ 
years ago. She said that ""my tooth is cracked and leaking"" which 
the ED attending said is not. She said "" I'm having lost of pain 
I'm slowed down ..no energy I've had the crack since I was hit 
by the truck. When the truck hit me it didn't feel like an 
accident it slowed me down. I've tried cupping, acupuncture and 
massage, and I need to leave to see the dentist."" The patient 
said that she had been using vinegar to ""lighten my skin because 
in ___ if you have light skin its better."" She denied hearing 
voices or paranoid ideation but referentially said ""on the radio 
you must be thinking of the singer ___, she spells her name 
differently."" Her mother and sister reported that the patient 
seemed depressed which the patient denied and said ""I'm just 
slowed down."" She said that ""my sister brings other things in 
that aren't pain I was discussing things and the next thing I 
know my sister said I need to talk about things about her life. 
I understand if you give the staff a hard time it will come back 
to you.""

Brief Hospital Course:
Psychiatric: Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman who was brought in by 
her family for increasingly odd and potentially dangerous 
behaviors, disorganized thinking, paranoia, and possible making 
suicidal statements, after decompensating while living in 
___ for the last ___ years. She was brought in by her family 
under the guise that the ED would help fix a tooth that was 
bothering her, though their intent was to have her 
psychiatrically hospitalized. Upon admission, patient refused to 
take all medications given her believe that she did not have a 
psychiatric illness. She remained pressured, disorganized, 
paranoid, and psychotic. She was initially extremely distrustful 
of her family. She was further fixated on marrying a Hindu man 
even though her family is Muslim, and she had significant 
distrust of the primary team with frequent requests for a 
translator (even though patient was born in the ___. and fluent 
in ___.
.
Patient gradually began accepting Risperdal, and was committed 
on a ___, where her family testified supporting her committment. 
After limited improvement on Risperdal alone, patient was 
subsequently committed on an 8b. Risperdal was gradually tapered 
up to 6mg with some improvement in her organization, although 
patient remained pressured, intrusive, concrete, and delusional. 
Cogentin 1 mg was added with good effect after patient developed 
mild stiffness/cogwheel rigidity. Ativan was also started (up to 
1 mg bid with additional prn) to target patients continued 
intensity, intrusiveness, and urgency, suggestive of possible 
hypomanic symptoms, also with good effect. Basic behavioral 
modification skills (i.e., ___ were utilized to address 
patient's concrete thinking and concerns related to her family, 
with limited initial evidence of patients capacity to engage in 
such treatment. Given patients memory lapses and 
perseverativeness, MOCA testing was performed, revealing no 
significant cognitive impairment. Symptoms were attributed to 
patients underlying thought disorder.
.
Throughout the course of her hospital stay, patient consistently 
stated she did not believe she has schizophrenia, admitting only 
to suffering from depression. Given patients severely 
impaired insight and concerns for likely medication 
non-adherence, Risperdal was subsequently gradually 
cross-tapered to Invega Sustenna. Patient received her first two 
injections on ___ and ___, respectively 234mg and 156mg. She 
tolerated this cross-taper well with no evidence of medication 
side effect. Cogentin was subsequently changed to prn. Ativan 
was continued at 1 mg bid given patients continued 
intrusiveness and urgency, with no need for additional prn 
medications. With ongoing antipsychotic treatment, the patient 
had significant improvement in her paranoia and degree of 
disorganization. She continued to have persistent desire to get 
married, and this changed from a deisre to marry a hindu man to 
have her family arrange a muselum marriage for her in ___. 
While initially extremely reluctant to allow her family to 
participate in her care, she eventually was amenable to and 
helped coordinate family meeting with parents and sister. With 
increasing family involvement it was noted, that her parents 
were supporting the idea of an arranged marriage in ___, but 
ultimately all (including the patient) agreed to postpone any 
major life choices such as marriage and trauma for ___ 
year until the patient was doing well and was stable outside the 
hospital. An application for ___ services and intermediate care 
were filed, though as patient demonstrated significnat 
improvement, she was ultimately referred for stepdown at the 
___ Partial Program at ___.
.
Of note, after spending her first trial day to the ___ Partial 
Progam on day pass, patient reportedly informed ___ staff that 
she had a dental appointment at ___, at which point she left 
___ unaccompanied and without primary teams awareness. Per AWA 
protocol, ___ public safety, police, and family were notified 
immediately. Patient ultimately returned to ___ on her own a 
few hours later, after having successfully received dental care 
at ___ at a ___ clinic. While her 
elopement was of significant concern to all parties, it did 
demonstrate that patient was organized enough to make her own 
appointment, obtain bus/train fare, and learn the public 
transportation system on her own, thus demonstrating significant 
improvement in her degree of organization and ability to care 
for herself in a less restrictive environment. After completing 
a second successful trial day to the ___ Partial Program, 
patient was discharged to their care. Per ___ Partial staff, 
patient was noted to be eager, appropriate, and with good 
participation during groups during her two trial days, with no 
anxiety or distress observed. Patient herself repeatedly 
expressed her enthusiasm for moving into the ___ and 
starting the ___ Partial Program. At time of discharge, the 
patient no longer presented as an acute risk to herself. She had 
no evidence of agressiveness or suicidality through out her 
admission. She was court committed under concern for ability to 
care for herself, but at time of discharge she appeared to be 
maintaining her ADLS well, was agreeable to Invega Sustaina, 
ongoing mental heatlh treatment, had improved relationships with 
her family and a clear desire to stay where her parents were, 
and an ability to make follow up appointments. Her boundaries 
with others had also significantly improved during the admission 

.
Medical: Upon admission, Ms. ___ complained of significant 
tooth pain after a reported MVA in ___ earlier this year. 
She was evaluated by dentistry and found to have a cap missing. 
Dental films demonstrated no sign of infection. As complete 
dental work could not be performed in the hospital, the plan was 
to have the cap fixed after hospital discharge, though as noted 
above, patient arranged initial dental treatment on her own 
while on day pass. Further dental work to be arranged by patient 
and her family. There were otherwise no acute medical issues 
during patients hospital stay.
.
Legal: ___
Social/Milieu: In the intial portion of her hospitalization, Ms. 
___ was paranoid about her family. She refused to have the 
team speak to her family, At the time of dischagre, this 
paranoia about her family had resolved, and she was most focused 
on healing the family, staying on good terms with them and 
moving forward. Her family was involved in her care through out 
her hospitalization to different degrees based on the patients 
cooperation. At time of discharge a family meeting was held with 
her sister, mother and father. All of her family members 
appeared to understand her illness and the importance of ongoing 
psychiatric care and need for medication. They were ultimately 
in support of her discharge plan to the ___ and the 
partial hosptial program. In the future her mother will consider 
having the patient stay with her and intends to remain a close 
support.  On the unit, patient demonstrated increased activity 
and engagement with others as her symptoms improved. She had 
good group attendance, and she was observed to be sociable with 
select peers and staff. While perseverative and intrustive at 
times, she was in good behavioral control, with no need for 
chemical or physical restraint.
.

time. Due to her
limited insight into her illness, Ms. ___ does have the 
chronic risk of treatment non-adherence, but this risk has been 
minimized with injectable medication and comprehensive treatment 
program connected to her living arrangement. Her family will 
also continue to closely monitor her treatment adherence. There

3.  Mildly dilated appendiceal tip measuring up to 7mm, with 
hyperemia, may represent early tip appendicitis.  Correlate 
clinically with physical exams and labs. 
3.  Bilateral fat containing inguinal hernias. 

MRI ABD
3.5 cm segment VII hepatic abscess and potential 1.7 cm segment 
V phlegmonous area of inflammation.  Right lobe location of 
hepatic infection suggests appendiceal source of infection, 
particularly given the abnormal appearance of the tip on recent 
CT.  The appendix is not reassessed on the current MRI, as it is 
not included within the field of view on this examination. 

RUQ Ultrasound
3.3 x 3.9 x 3.2 cm hepatic abscess ___ segment VII.  Hepatic 
steatosis.

seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular 
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The prosthetic tricuspid leaflets appear normal. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal left and right systolic function. No evidence 
of endocarditis.

TTE (___)
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
akinesis/thinning of the distal half of the inferolateral and 
inferior walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 
40-45 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
regional systolic dysfunction c/w prior infarction (LVEF 
40-45%). Mild mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary 
muscle dysfunction. 
.
ETT w Nuclear Imaging (___)
Excellent exercise tolerance. No anginal symptoms with 
nonspecific T wave changes. Anterior(V1-V3) ST-T wave changes 
uninterpretable for ischemia in the presence of the RBBB. In the 
presence 
of the RBBB, the anterior(V1-V3) ST-T wave changes are 
uninterpretable 
for ischemia. Deeper T wave inversion (no J-point depression) 
was noted 
inferiorly and in the lateral precordial leads (nonspecific 
finding). 
The rhythm was sinus with frequent multiformed VPDs, infrequent 
ventricular couplets and, in post-exercise period, one 5-bt run 
of an 
acclerated idioventicular rhythm(rate~72-94) was noted. Resting 
baseline hypertension. Nuclear report sent separately. 
.
NUCLEAR IMAGING - INTERPRETATION: 
The image quality is good. 
Left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a large severe fixed 
defect in the lateral wall and a large severe fixed defect in 
the inferolateral wall.   
Given severe photopenia in the affected segments, wall motion in 
these areas cannot be determined, but presumed akinetic. 
Otherwise, wall motion is normal. 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 44%. 
No comparisons. 
Two large severe fixed defects consistent with prior infarction. 

Ejection fraction 44%. 
.
EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Prior inferolateral myocardial infarction. Right 
bundle-branch block. Probable true posterior component as well. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD (old 
MIs), admitted with ventricular tachycardia, converted to NSR 
with lidocaine, transferred to the CCU s/p failed ablation c/b 
groin bleeding.
.  
# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA: Pt is has a hx of CAD with prior 
inferior infact ___ years prior.  She was admitted with 
hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT with excertion after 
shoveling snow. She was started on lidocain gtt, that was 
stopped on ___. She underwent stress test on ___, with no VT 
induced. The patient underwnet EP study on ___, but were unable 
to ablate the source of her VT.  Post-op her course was 
complicated by hematoma and low urine output and monitored in 
the CCU. A U/S showed no pseudoaneurysm and an ill-defined 
hematoma. She also had a CT-scan on ___ that did not show RP 
bleed.  Her Hct dropped to 26, but remained stable. Her urine 
output improved with IVF.  She was started on amiodarone 200mg 
TID on ___.  She remained stable and while she had occasional 
episodes of ___ beat V-tach on tele she remained asymptomatic. 
She underwent successful ICD placement on ___. She recieved one 
dose of Vancomycin prior to the procedure as well as 12 hours 
after placement.  The likely source of her VT was thought to 
from prior scar from MI. She was discharged on Amiodarone 200mg 
BID (which will be continued until her cardiology follow-up) and 
her prior dose of atenolol 50mg daily.  Her nifedipine was 
discontinued.  She was also started on Keflex x2days.  She will 
have follow-up with device clinic in one week as well as 
follow-up with Dr. ___ in approx 1 month.   
.  
# Pump: Her stress MIBI showed wall motion defect, likely from 
old MI, EF of 44%. Her metoprolol was held in the setting of 
bleeding, but restarted when stable. She was continued on 
atenolol and lisinopril as an outpatient.
.  
# HTN: Her home nifedipine and atenolol were discontinued on 
admission.  Additionally, she was started on metoprolol and 
continued on her lisinopril.  Her BP meds were held after the 
procedure due to concerns of bleeding.  Her BP ranged between 
130-160's during her admission, but improved when she was placed 
back on her home medications.  She she was stablized and put 
back on her home atenolol and lisinopril.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from the ___ Trauma service 
to ___ Orthopedic Surgery team and admitted. On hospital 
day #3 was taken to the operating room for above described 
procedure. Please see separately dictated operative report for 
details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated 
the procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV 
antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On hospital day 0, a urine culture was obtained. It was positive 
for a urinary tract infection.  She was started on a 
ciprofloxacin 250mg BID x 7 days.  On postoperative day 1 the 
patient was noted to be tachycardic to 115-120 with a new oxygen 
requirement of 2LNC and hypotension to the 90's. An EKG showed 
nonspecific changes. A CXR was unremarkable, and so a CTPE was 
performed which was negative for pulmonary embolism. 

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was 
removed and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. 
The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical 
incision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or 
abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical 
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and 
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was 
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was 
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was 
acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral 
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and 
the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions. 

 
Mrs ___ is discharged to home with services in stable 
condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with past medical history of polysubstance abuse 
(inc. IVDU), hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, GAD, and ADHD was 
brought to ___ on ___ for overdose (heroin/cocaine) was 
intubated with hypotension, TTE revealed AS and right heart 
hypokinesia, and aspiration pneumonia. He was extubated and left 
AMA on ___. He then went to ___ on ___ they found 
elevated trops with a peak of 0.32, new t wave inversions, ___ 
Cr 3, and elevated LFTs ALT>AST. While he was waiting for 
transport to BID Cardiology he left AMA on ___. He self 
presented here at BID for further workup of cardiac concerns.

In the ED, he was complaining of pleuritic chest pain and 
concerns of his heart health following this recent overdose. EKG 
showed t wave flattening and mild t wave inversion in the 
precordial inferior leads. He was afebrile, vitals were stable, 
and troponins were down-trending (0.13->0.11). Non-contrast head 
CT revealed no bleed but was notable for an incidental finding 
of a small, hypodense regnio with the left globus pallidus which 
may represent chronic microvascular ischemic changes but is 
indeteriminant in nature; an out patient head MRI without 
contrast is recommended. He was started on vancomycin and 
cefepime empirically, blood cultures x3 were drawn, and ASA & 
statin were started. 

During his stay on the medicine floor, antibiotic therapy was 
transitioned to oral levaquin and he was monitored for worsening 
respiratory status and fever. He improved on therapy despite 
lack of culture data (no sputum). A repeat TTE showed improved 
cardiac function and a bicuspid aortic valve. 

Our social worker was able to get him accept back to the 
___ clinic in ___ with an intake appointment setup on 
___ at 10:00am and a doctor's appointment on 
___ at 7:45am. In consultation with this clinic 
and our Psychiatry consult service, we restarted his methadone 
treatment starting at 20mg and increasing the dose by ___ per 
day as need. By discharge, he was on 40mg of methadone (last 
dose prior this admission per ___ clinic was 95mg on 
___. Last EKG QTc 419.

Mr. ___ medication for GAD, alprazolam 1mg daily, was 
restarted while inpatient. But his Adderall prescription was 
reduced to 15mg bid given concerns for cardiac strain.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You came to ___ for chest pain, fatigue, and concerns for 
heart problems following an overdose and resulting episode of 
pneumonia. Please see more details listed below about what 
happened while you were in the hospital and your instructions 
for what to do after leaving the hospital.

It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the 
best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

WHAT WAS DONE WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL:

- An EKG, a test for the electrical activity of the heart, was 
conducted when you arrived in the emergency room that showed 
changes consistent with significant strain on your heart. 

- An xray of your chest revealed an infection (pneumonia) in the 
upper aspect of your right lung.

- We also performed a CAT scan of your head to make sure there 
was no bleeding and incidentally discovered a small area in your 
brain that may have diminished blood flow. However, this may be 
an artifact of the imaging. A better imaging technique (MRI) is 
suggested at a future date. While here you exhibited no clinical 
signs that were concerning for bleeding or stroke. 

- You were started on IV antibiotics to treat the pneumonia and 
transitioned to an oral antibiotic which you completed with no 
signs of resistance and improvement of symptoms. 

- During your stay at one of the outside hospitals and repeated 
here, an ultrasound of your heart was done and some issues were 
found: 

1. Flow through one of the main valves of your heart (aortic 
valve) is restricted due to, likely, an unusual structure to 
this valve. Instead of three leaves, your aortic valve has two 
leaves. This causes some restriction of flow from the heart and 
the murmur you to which you are aware. 

2. The right side of your heart was not pumping as well as it 
should. The repeated ultrasound of your heart revealed that this 
has resolved. Your heart is pumping as it should. 

- While staying with us, we were able to get you back into the 
___ clinic of your choice and we initiated your treatment. 
We discharged you on 40mg methadone daily given some concerns 
for a lower heart rate. Given concerns for your heart health 
care should be exercised as you re-start your treatment.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL:
- Please check in to the ___ clinic (Habit OP___ 
on ___ at 10:00am for your intake appointment.
- Please follow up your primary care provider who will be 
provided with all of the information regarding this admission. 
- Consider discussing cardiac rehab with your primary care 
provider (information was provided to you by our social worker).
- Stop all alcohol use and illicit drug use. 
- Continue smoking cessation.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male s/p syncopal fall +HS to chin -LOC sustained 
bilateral displaced subcondylar fractures and displaced left 
mandibular parasymphysis fracture. Patient also was noted to 
have bright red blood in his bilateral external ear canals, 
nonactive, and attempts to visualize ___ were not successful. 
ENT was consulted for management of canal lacerations. They 
recommended olfloxin drops to bilateral ears and follow-up as an 
outpatient. 

The patient was seen by OMFS and taken to the operating room for 
open reduction and internal fixation of the left parasymphysis 
fracture through intraoral
approach and closed reduction with maxillomandibular fixation of 
bilateral subcondylar fractures with ___ arch bars, which went 
well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note 
for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the 
patient arrived on the floor tolerating sips, on IV fluids, and 
oral analgesia for pain control.  The patient was 
hemodynamically stable.
.
Tertiary exam was negative for additional injuries. Pain was 
well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as tolerated to 
a full liquid diet with good tolerability. The patient voided 
without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

Pertinent Results:
___ CTA head and neck
Subarachnoid hemorrhage centered within the suprasellar and 
perimesencephalic cisterns with new intraventricular extension 
into the 
occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle. 
2. CT of the head and neck is limited secondary to timing of 
contrast bolus which limites evaluation for aneurysm. There is 
no large vessel occlusion. 
3. Stenosis at the origin of the proximal right internal carotid 
artery 
measuring approximately 53% stenosis by NASCET criteria and 
diffuse intimal thickening of the proximal left internal carotid 
artery without stenosis by NASCET criteria. 

___ diagnostic cerebral angiogram
-Negative for aneurysm

___ TCD's:
1. There was no evidence of vasospasm. 
2. This study was mildly abnormal due to below normal mean
velocities in the right anterior circulation, likely due to poor
right temporal bone window or poor angle of probe insonation. 

___ TCD's: 
1. There was no evidence of vasospasm. 
2. This study was mildly abnormal due to hyperemia in the right
proximal MCA and right terminal ICA. 

___ TCD's: 
1. There was no evidence of vasospasm. 
2. This study was mildly abnormal due to hyperemia in the right
proximal MCA and Right ACA

___ MRI OF HEAD:
1. No evidence of an arteriovenous malformation. 
2. Small scattered acute to subacute infarcts throughout the 
anterior and 
posterior circulations. The small, scattered appearance is more 
consistent 
with an embolic etiology rather than vasospasm. 
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal and suprasellar 
cisterns, as seen on CT from ___. No hydrocephalus. 

___ MR ___ with and without contrast:
1. No evidence of a vascular malformation in the cervical spine. 

2. Degenerative disc and joint disease causes cord remodeling, 
moderate spinal stenosis at C4-5 and C5-6 levels and severe 
neural foraminal stenosis at multiple levels, detailed above. No 
cord signal abnormality. 

___ TCDs
1. There was no evidence of vasospasm. 
2. Below normal mean flow velocities in the Right ACA and
bilateral vertebral arteries. This is most likely due to poor
bone window.

CAROTID/CEREBRAL BILAT BILAT ___ 
1. No aneurysm or vascular malformation identified is the source 
of the 
patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given the initial CT 
findings, this likely represents a perimesencephalic hemorrhage. 

  
2. When compared to the prior angiogram of ___ there 
is mild vessel narrowing in the bilateral ICA circulation which 
may be secondary to technique, or mild spasm. We will continue 
to monitor the patient clinically. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, the patient presented to ED with a subarachnoid 
hemorrhage.  He was taken to angio where he had a diagnostic 
cerebral angiogram which was negative for aneurysm.  He was 
transferred to the SICU for close monitoring.  He was placed on 
nimodipine for vasospasm prevention.  His blood pressure 
parameters were 100-160.  TCD's were ordered.  He was also kept 
on 100cc/hr of NS.

On ___, the patient was stable neurologically.  He was started 
on dexamethasone 4mg Q6h for his headache with plans to taper 
this over 2 weeks.  His nimodipine was adjusted to 30mg Q2h for 
hypotension.  TCD's showed no evidence of spasm.

On ___, the patient was stable and there were no events over 
night.  An MRI of the brain with and without contrast was 
scheduled for ___ to check for a micro-AVM.  TCD's showed 
hyperemia to the right MCA but no vasospasm. 

On ___, the patient remained neurologically and hemodynamically 
stable. Plan for MRI head tomorrow and Angio on ___. TCDs 
showed heperemia to R MCA and no vasospasm. 

On ___, the patient remained stable. An MRI of the head and 
neck was obtained and revealed no AV malformations but again 
confirmed subarachnoid blood in the basal and suprasellar 
cisterns. Will stay in the ICU for the weekend with plans for a 
diagnostic angiogram. TCDs study was limited but no change in 
velocity. 

Mr. ___ continued to recover well between ___ and ___.  On 
___, he was taken the angio suite for a repeat cerebral 
angiogram.  The angio was negative for any vascular malformation 
or aneurysm.  The patient returned to the ICU for further 
management.  On the same day, TCDs were performed and also 
showed no vasospasm, although the study was somewhat limited.  
The patient remained neurologically intact during this time.  
Mr. ___ was transferred to the floor for continued management.

On ___, patient remained stable on exam. He was ambulating and 
voiding appropriatedly and was discharged home in stable 
condition.

Pertinent Results:
___ CTA head and neck
Subarachnoid hemorrhage centered within the suprasellar and
perimesencephalic cisterns with new intraventricular extension
into the
occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle.
2. CT of the head and neck is limited secondary to timing of
contrast bolus which limites evaluation for aneurysm. There is
no large vessel occlusion.
3. Stenosis at the origin of the proximal right internal carotid
artery
measuring approximately 53% stenosis by NASCET criteria and
diffuse intimal thickening of the proximal left internal carotid
artery without stenosis by NASCET criteria.
___ diagnostic cerebral angiogram
-Negative for aneurysm
___ TCD's:
1. There was no evidence of vasospasm.
2. This study was mildly abnormal due to below normal mean
velocities in the right anterior circulation, likely due to poor
right temporal bone window or poor angle of probe insonation.
___ TCD's:
1. There was no evidence of vasospasm.
2. This study was mildly abnormal due to hyperemia in the right
proximal MCA and right terminal ICA.
___ TCD's:
1. There was no evidence of vasospasm.
2. This study was mildly abnormal due to hyperemia in the right
proximal MCA and Right ACA
___ MRI OF HEAD:
1. No evidence of an arteriovenous malformation.
2. Small scattered acute to subacute infarcts throughout the
anterior and
posterior circulations. The small, scattered appearance is more
consistent
with an embolic etiology rather than vasospasm.
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal and suprasellar
cisterns, as seen on CT from ___. No hydrocephalus.
___ MR ___ with and without contrast:
1. No evidence of a vascular malformation in the cervical spine.
2. Degenerative disc and joint disease causes cord remodeling,
moderate spinal stenosis at C4-5 and C5-6 levels and severe
neural foraminal stenosis at multiple levels, detailed above. No
cord signal abnormality.
___ TCDs
1. There was no evidence of vasospasm.
2. Below normal mean flow velocities in the Right ACA and
bilateral vertebral arteries. This is most likely due to poor
bone window.
CAROTID/CEREBRAL BILAT BILAT ___
1. No aneurysm or vascular malformation identified is the source
of the
patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given the initial CT
findings, this likely represents a perimesencephalic hemorrhage.
2. When compared to the prior angiogram of ___ there
is mild vessel narrowing in the bilateral ICA circulation which
may be secondary to technique, or mild spasm. We will continue
to monitor the patient clinically.
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, the patient presented to ED with a subarachnoid
hemorrhage. He was taken to angio where he had a diagnostic
cerebral angiogram which was negative for aneurysm. He was
transferred to the SICU for close monitoring. He was placed on
nimodipine for vasospasm prevention. His blood pressure
parameters were 100-160. TCD's were ordered. He was also kept
on 100cc/hr of NS.
On ___, the patient was stable neurologically. He was started
on dexamethasone 4mg Q6h for his headache with plans to taper
this over 2 weeks. His nimodipine was adjusted to 30mg Q2h for
hypotension. TCD's showed no evidence of spasm.
On ___, the patient was stable and there were no events over
night. An MRI of the brain with and without contrast was
scheduled for ___ to check for a micro-AVM. TCD's showed
hyperemia to the right MCA but no vasospasm.
On ___, the patient remained neurologically and hemodynamically
stable. Plan for MRI head tomorrow and Angio on ___. TCDs
showed heperemia to R MCA and no vasospasm.
On ___, the patient remained stable. An MRI of the head and
neck was obtained and revealed no AV malformations but again
confirmed subarachnoid blood in the basal and suprasellar
cisterns. Will stay in the ICU for the weekend with plans for a
diagnostic angiogram. TCDs study was limited but no change in
velocity.
Mr. ___ continued to recover well between ___ and ___. On
___, he was taken the angio suite for a repeat cerebral
angiogram. The angio was negative for any vascular malformation
or aneurysm. The patient returned to the ICU for further
management. On the same day, TCDs were performed and also
showed no vasospasm, although the study was somewhat limited.
The patient remained neurologically intact during this time.
Mr. ___ was transferred to the floor for continued management.
On ___, patient remained stable on exam. He was ambulating and
voiding appropriatedly and was discharged home in stable
condition.

not endorsed any verbally during the last week of 
hospitalization.  She has shown good behavioral control and good 
judgment in the hospital.  At time of discharge, she recognized 
the severity of her actions preceding her hospitalization. The 
delusions that were prominent and leading to gross impairments 
in judgment and behavior upon admission, have greatly subsided. 
Ms. ___ denies any intention/plan to find Dr. ___ his 
family, and she recognizes doing such would likely result in 
police involvement.  She denies access to weapons such as guns, 
and she has no h/o violence. Risk of recidivism has not been 
eliminated, as delusions are fixed false beliefs, but risk is 
greatly diminished. She is agreeing to continue to take meds, 
with plan for ___ to come to her house to administer Invega. 

Patient endorsed anxiety while in the hospital and received 
Ativan 0.5mg BID prn and  0.5mg QHS prn insomnia x 1 repeat with 
adequate symptomatic control. She did not always use the 
available dose and was given risks/benefits/side effects of the 
medication given her age. She was discharged on Ativan 0.5mg 
daily prn, which patient was comfortable with.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Psychiatric.
___ with h/o bipolar d/o and non-small cell lung carcinoma
who came to the ED in a manic and psychotic state. Pt stopped
taking her meds in ___ after the death of her mother. She
moved out of her house at that time and moved into her childhood
home, separating from her husband. She has had erotomanic
delusions (toward Dr. ___ prior PCP, since ___,
grandiose delusions (She is Gods daughter, and ___
___), and ideas of reference (messages from the weather).
She also intermittently stated that she was divorced from her
husband, which she was not. Patient initially refused to accept
the recommended dosages of antipsychotic medications. She was
only willing to take Navane 5mg daily, a medication she was
previously prescribed because it had minimal side effects for
her. She was court committed to stay in hospital and receive
medication. She received first Invega injection on ___,
second dose ___. Before patient received Invega injections,
she was intermittently and inconsistently denying her delusions.
Patient acknowledged that she denied them at times of fear
because she was God's daughter, and was afraid she would be
attacked by Al-Quaeda. Patient also denied them and became
paranoid and irritable toward treatment team when she wanted to
leave the hospital. Her delusions greatly subsided since Invega
with improved insight, with intermittent paranoia and
irritability. Collateral was obtained from her psychiatrist Dr.
___ who stated that patient has a history of
non-compliance and has had several med trials to include
Zyprexa, Risperdal, Invega in the past, all which she stopped
because of weight gain. Collateral obtained from her husband,
___, was that she has had a delusion involving her
relationship with ___ since the ___, and that her
main issue is noncompliance with meds. ___ is aware that
___ has sent mail to Dr. ___, and has also driven
by Dr. ___, but this was the first incident where
police were involved. Collateral obtained from ___
unveiled that patient had been calling his office while in the
hospital, so phone restrictions on Ms ___ were placed. Dr.
___ was aware of ___ delusion since the ___ at which time
he transferred her care to a different PCP. Dr. ___
___ husband have spoken regarding this. Dr. ___
___ concern regarding his safety and was referred to ___
legal department. Dr. ___ will also contact Dr. ___
___ regarding her discharge.
Ms. ___ may continue to hold erotomanic delusions, but she has
not endorsed any verbally during the last week of
hospitalization. She has shown good behavioral control and good
judgment in the hospital. At time of discharge, she recognized
the severity of her actions preceding her hospitalization. The
delusions that were prominent and leading to gross impairments
in judgment and behavior upon admission, have greatly subsided.
Ms. ___ denies any intention/plan to find Dr. ___ his
family, and she recognizes doing such would likely result in
police involvement. She denies access to weapons such as guns,
and she has no h/o violence. Risk of recidivism has not been
eliminated, as delusions are fixed false beliefs, but risk is
greatly diminished. She is agreeing to continue to take meds,
with plan for ___ to come to her house to administer Invega.
Patient endorsed anxiety while in the hospital and received
Ativan 0.5mg BID prn and 0.5mg QHS prn insomnia x 1 repeat with
adequate symptomatic control. She did not always use the
available dose and was given risks/benefits/side effects of the
medication given her age. She was discharged on Ativan 0.5mg
daily prn, which patient was comfortable with.
___ Trazadone was increased to 150mg QHS.
#) Medical.

experiencing anxiety, however this resolved without additional
intervention. Patient was maintained on home dose Lisinopril
2.5mg daily and will continue this outpatient.
HLD. Patient was continued on home dose Pravastatin 10mg QHS and
will continue this outpatient.
h/o non-small cell lung cancer. CT chest and MRI brain was
completed to evaluate for any evidence of recurrence of
metastasis. CT chest showed adrenal gland thickening which was
recommended to be followed up with either MRI or multiphase CT.
Allergies. Patient was maintained on Fexofenadine 60mg BID for
allergy related symptoms. Patient contributed these symptoms to
use of Talcum powder in her hair.
Constipation. Patient was given Lactulose 30mL BID prn
constipation. She had daily BM and used medication when
necessary.

History of Present Illness:
Per patient's family. ___ yo male presented to ___ 
___ ED with pulmonary edema, acute respiratory failure & 
aystole s/p epinephrine and CPR in the field. According to 
daughter, pt had malaise/URTI symptoms for past couple days and 
this morning at 0500 hrs he was feeling poorly. At 0600 hrs, he 
was distressed with worsening dyspnea and ""ashen"" in appearance. 
When paramedics arrived, pt had laboured breathing and received 
CPAP but became bradycardic then had PEA. He was treated with 
one dose of epinephrine and CPR and returned to sinus rhythm.

In ED, pt was unresponsive with GCS 3, sinus tachycardic, 
hypertensive (BP 188/116), with sluggish pupils. Pt was 
intubated and again became bradycardic/asystolic. He responded 
with CPR and 1mg epinephrine. EKG showed sinus tachy to 130s, 
LVH, STD anterolateral leads, but no STE. CXR obtained showed 
diffuse pulmonary edema. Pt received albuterol and Lasix. Pt 
became hypertensive to 188/116, was given IV nitroglycerin, and 
BP fell to 105/76. Pt was transferred to ICU. He underwent head 
CT (positive for atherosclerosis and mild diffuse atrophy, 
negative for acute process), and afterward had GCS of 5. Pt was 
cooled with ice packs. Initial ABG showed pH 7.113 and PCo2 
89.7, and repeat ABG showed pH 7.206 and PCo2 59.2. WBC of 12, 
Mg of 2.6, K of 3.5. TSH of 10.32, T4 of 1.03. Pt received 10 
meQ potassium IV x1. Fentanyl drip was initiated at 25mcg for 
sedation.

Prior to transfer, pt was noted to have twitching and eyelid 
fluttering and was given ativan 0.5mg IV. Daughter denies 
tonic-clonic activity pre-hospital.

Pt was transferred to ___ CCU intubated with cooling pads in 
place. Cardiac arrest team was consulted and per their 
recommendations, pt was initiated on cooling protocol (34-36C). 

Pt had episodes of flickering lower lip and decorticate 
posturing with rigidity in upper limbs, but no obvious 
shivering. Pt under continuous EEG per cardiac arrest protocol

IMAGING:
EKG (___): Normal sinus rhythm. Left anterior hemiblock. 
Rate 57, PR 168, QRS 100, QTc (___) 440.

TTE (___): IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Mildly 
dilated LV with mild symmetric hypertrophy and moderatedly 
depressed global systolic function in a pattern most c/w 
non-ischemic etiology. Mildly dilated aortic root and descending 
thoracic aorta. Mild functional AR. Findings suggestive of 
hypertensive heart disease. LVEF <40%, pt may benefit from beta 
blocker and an ACEi or ___. The patient has a mildly dilated 
ascending aorta.

EEG (___): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU EEG study 
due to the presence of diffusely low voltages throughout the 
record without any reactivity. This background is interspersed 
with very brief bursts of generalized delta frequency activity 
that is not associated with clinical correlate. Lip twitches 
noted above are not associated with any electrographic 
correlate. Overall, these findings are suggestive of severe 
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific as to 
etiology, but in this case likely secondary to hypoxic ischemic 
injury. No electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges 
are identified. The presence of a burst suppression pattern 
following cardiac arrest is generally associated with poor 
neurologic outcome, but EEG is most helpful for prognostication 
after rewarming from hypothermia, approximately 72 hours post 
arrest. 

EEG (___): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU EEG study 
due to the presence of a burst suppression pattern where a 
highly attenuated nonreactive background is interspersed by 
brief bursts of polymorphic delta frequency waves that are not 
associated with a clinical correlate. Overall, these findings 
are suggestive of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No 
electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges were 
identified. The presence of a burst suppression pattern 
following cardiac arrest is generally associated with poor 
neurologic outcome, although EEG is most useful for 
prognostication at 72 hours following arrest. 

CXR (___): No change from ___ in the appearance of the 
monitoring and support devices.  The hazy opacification at the 
bases, especially on the left, is less prominent, which could 
reflect the decrease in layering effusion, though it could 
merely be a manifestation of a more upright position of the 
patient. Prominence of reticular markings at the bases, more 
prominent on the right, most likely represents atelectasis, 
though there may be mild asymmetric elevation of pulmonary 
venous pressure.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ hx CHF s/p hypoxic PEA arrest.
Pt was brought to the CCU mechanically ventilated on fentanyl 
gtt The therapeutic hypothermia protocol was continued (33-35C, 
PCO2 35-45 with PaO2 >94%) x 24 hrs and then pt was subsequently 
rewarmed. Rewarming was completed on ___ at 1800. Pt had 
TTE which showed mildly dilated atria, EF 35%, suggestive of 
underlying untreated hypertensive disease. Pt was initially 
having lip/facial twitching and was given rocuronium and started 
on continuous EEG monitoring as per neuro and epilepsy team 
rec's. Rocuronium was discontinued at onset of rewarming. Once 
rewarmed to 37C, fentanyl was discontinued and pt was started on 
propofol infusion with midazolam boluses. All sedation was 
discontinued at ___ on ___ and period spontaneous waking 
trials were implemented with no response. For seizure-like 
activity, pt was given Keppra 1000mg daily per neuro rec's and 
EEG monitoring was discontinued.  EEG c/w hypoxic injury. After 
72 hours, patient remained without unarousable with extensor 
posturing and without pain responses. Family discussion took 
place with Neurology and CCU teams.  It was decided that care 
would be withdrawn in light of poor neurologic prognosis.  
Patient extubated and died within 12 hours.

highly attenuated nonreactive background is interspersed by
brief bursts of polymorphic delta frequency waves that are not
associated with a clinical correlate. Overall, these findings
are suggestive of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No
electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges were
identified. The presence of a burst suppression pattern
following cardiac arrest is generally associated with poor
neurologic outcome, although EEG is most useful for
prognostication at 72 hours following arrest.
CXR (___): No change from ___ in the appearance of the
monitoring and support devices. The hazy opacification at the
bases, especially on the left, is less prominent, which could
reflect the decrease in layering effusion, though it could
merely be a manifestation of a more upright position of the
patient. Prominence of reticular markings at the bases, more
prominent on the right, most likely represents atelectasis,
though there may be mild asymmetric elevation of pulmonary
venous pressure.
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ hx CHF s/p hypoxic PEA arrest.
Pt was brought to the CCU mechanically ventilated on fentanyl
gtt The therapeutic hypothermia protocol was continued (33-35C,
PCO2 35-45 with PaO2 >94%) x 24 hrs and then pt was subsequently
rewarmed. Rewarming was completed on ___ at 1800. Pt had
TTE which showed mildly dilated atria, EF 35%, suggestive of
underlying untreated hypertensive disease. Pt was initially
having lip/facial twitching and was given rocuronium and started
on continuous EEG monitoring as per neuro and epilepsy team
rec's. Rocuronium was discontinued at onset of rewarming. Once
rewarmed to 37C, fentanyl was discontinued and pt was started on
propofol infusion with midazolam boluses. All sedation was
discontinued at ___ on ___ and period spontaneous waking
trials were implemented with no response. For seizure-like
activity, pt was given Keppra 1000mg daily per neuro rec's and
EEG monitoring was discontinued. EEG c/w hypoxic injury. After
72 hours, patient remained without unarousable with extensor
posturing and without pain responses. Family discussion took
place with Neurology and CCU teams. It was decided that care
would be withdrawn in light of poor neurologic prognosis.
Patient extubated and died within 12 hours.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
 
You admitted to ___ because you are having 
worsening shortness of breath. 

We found that your heart was in an abnormal rhythm called atrial 
fibrillation.  We started you on a medication called diltiazem 
to help control your heart rate.  We also started you on a blood 
thinner called Xarelto (or rivaroxaban) to protect you against 
the risk of stroke.  Fortunately the medication helped you go 
back to your regular heart rhythm. You are still at risk of 
going back into atrial fibrillation and therefore we continued 
your blood thinner.
 
Please follow-up with your primary care doctor.
Please continue to take your medications as prescribed.
 
Please return to the hospital if you have sudden onset chest 
pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, bleeding that does 
not stop or are having any other concerning symptoms.
 
We wish you the best in health,
 
Your ___ team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You admitted to ___ because you are having
worsening shortness of breath.
We found that your heart was in an abnormal rhythm called atrial
fibrillation. We started you on a medication called diltiazem
to help control your heart rate. We also started you on a blood
thinner called Xarelto (or rivaroxaban) to protect you against
the risk of stroke. Fortunately the medication helped you go
back to your regular heart rhythm. You are still at risk of
going back into atrial fibrillation and therefore we continued
your blood thinner.
Please follow-up with your primary care doctor.
Please continue to take your medications as prescribed.
Please return to the hospital if you have sudden onset chest
pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, bleeding that does
not stop or are having any other concerning symptoms.
We wish you the best in health,
Your ___ team

CTA CHEST/ABD (___)
1. No aortic dissection.
2. Trace left pleural effusion.
3. Chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm, stable.

HEAD CT (___)
No acute intracranial process.

ECHO (___)
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal 
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. 
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

MRI ABDOMEN (___)
Left paraspinal musculature microabscesses centered at T12-L1, 
with extensive surrounding intra and intermuscular edema and 
hyperemia.  Abnormal enhancement extends into the left T12 
neural foramen with thickening of the epidural space, likely 
reactive in nature, and no evidence of an epidural abscess.  The 
L1 vertebral body is subtly edematous, but osteomyelitis is 
suspected of the
medial left 12th rib, surrounded by the soft tissue infection.

MRI L-SPINE (___)
1. No evidence of diskitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural 
collection.
2. Edema and mild contrast enhancement in the left posterior 
paravertebral
muscles without a fluid collection. Diagnostic considerations 
include muscle sprain or myositis, which may be inflammatory or 
infectious. Please correlate clinically.
3. Multilevel lumbar degenerative disease without significant 
spinal canal
stenosis. Mass effect on the exiting left L4 nerve root at L4-5 
and on the
exiting right L5 nerve root at L5-S1, as detailed above.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH significant for HIV (CD4 484) and HTN who 
presents with nontraumatic left flank pain and syncope.

# MRSA BACTEREMIA/OSTEOMYELITIS: The patient presented with ___ 
SIRS criteria: fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. His only 
symptom was left flank pain. The patient was empirically started 
on vancomyin and cefepime for an unknown source. Blood cultures 
grew GPCs within 12 hours, later identified to be MRSA. The 
etiology of bacteremia remains unclear as he had no obvious skin 
lesions, recent dental manipulation, kidney stone, and IV drug 
use. He reports being sexually active. Therefore, it is possible 
that recent receptive anal sex led to microtears in the 
anorectal canal and seeded the blood stream. Echocardiogram was 
negative for vegetations. MRI showed left paraspinal musculature 
microabscesses with likely osteomyelitis of his left 12th rib. A 
PICC line was placed, and the patient will continue vancomycin 
for a total of 6 weeks. He will be followed by the infectious 
disease ___ clinic. 

# HYPONATREMIA: This was likely secondary to hypovolemia in the 
setting of sepsis. This improved with IV resuscitation.

# SYNCOPE: Admission EKG and telemetry was negative for 
arrhtyhmia. The patient did not have further syncopal episodes 
during hospitalization. Etiology of syncope felt to be vasovagal 
in the setting of severe pain.

# ST-DEPRESSIONS: Though the patient denied chest pain, 
admission EKG was notable for ST depressions in V3-V5. There was 
no prior EKG to compare. Serial EKG demonstrated improvement of 
ST-depressions. Troponins were negative x 3. CTA was negative 
for aortic dissection. 

# HIV: Most recent CD4 421, viral load <75 in ___.  He is 
sexually active with one steady male partner, with whom he has 
oral sex with on a regular basis. He had two episodes of 
receptive anal sex in the last month, with one episode that was 
unprotected with a new partner. He is not sexually active with 
his wife. His wife and the rest of his family are unaware of his 
HIV diagnosis and MSM status. He does inform his partners of his 
HIV status prior to engaging in sexual activity. The patient was 
continued on home medications.

# HYPERTENSION: He was continued on losartan and nifedipine.

# DEPRESSION: The patient was continued on citalopram.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUE:
- The patient's family is not aware of his HIV diagnosis and MSM 
status. 
- Follow up with infectious disease ___ clinic.
- The patient will require weekly blood draws: CBC with 
differential, BUN, Cr, vancomycin trough, ESR/CRP. All labs 
should be sent to ___ CLINIC at fax # ___.
- Draw labs on ___.
- All questions regarding outpatient parenteral antibiotics 
after discharge should be directed to the ___ 
R.N.s ___ or to the on-call ID fellow when the 
clinic is closed.
- Remove PICC line after completion of IV antibiotics. 
 
Medications on Admission:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted with left back pain. Your 
blood cultures grew bacteria (Staph Aureus). An MRI of your back 
showed the bacteria seeded one of your ribs, which is what 
caused your pain. An ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram), 
did not show any damage to your heart valves. We are not sure 
what caused the bacteria in the blood in the first place. 
Regardless, we started you on IV antibiotics (vancomycin), for 
which you will continue for 6 weeks. You will also follow up 
with the infectious disease doctors. In terms of working, there 
are no restrictions as long as you are able to administer your 
antibiotics. Please see below for medication changes and follow 
up appointments. 

We are glad you are feeling better and we wish you the best.

1. No evidence of diskitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural
collection.
2. Edema and mild contrast enhancement in the left posterior
paravertebral
muscles without a fluid collection. Diagnostic considerations
include muscle sprain or myositis, which may be inflammatory or
infectious. Please correlate clinically.
3. Multilevel lumbar degenerative disease without significant
spinal canal
stenosis. Mass effect on the exiting left L4 nerve root at L4-5
and on the
exiting right L5 nerve root at L5-S1, as detailed above.
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH significant for HIV (CD4 484) and HTN who
presents with nontraumatic left flank pain and syncope.
# MRSA BACTEREMIA/OSTEOMYELITIS: The patient presented with ___
SIRS criteria: fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. His only
symptom was left flank pain. The patient was empirically started
on vancomyin and cefepime for an unknown source. Blood cultures
grew GPCs within 12 hours, later identified to be MRSA. The
etiology of bacteremia remains unclear as he had no obvious skin
lesions, recent dental manipulation, kidney stone, and IV drug
use. He reports being sexually active. Therefore, it is possible
that recent receptive anal sex led to microtears in the
anorectal canal and seeded the blood stream. Echocardiogram was
negative for vegetations. MRI showed left paraspinal musculature
microabscesses with likely osteomyelitis of his left 12th rib. A
PICC line was placed, and the patient will continue vancomycin
for a total of 6 weeks. He will be followed by the infectious
disease ___ clinic.
# HYPONATREMIA: This was likely secondary to hypovolemia in the
setting of sepsis. This improved with IV resuscitation.
# SYNCOPE: Admission EKG and telemetry was negative for
arrhtyhmia. The patient did not have further syncopal episodes
during hospitalization. Etiology of syncope felt to be vasovagal
in the setting of severe pain.
# ST-DEPRESSIONS: Though the patient denied chest pain,
admission EKG was notable for ST depressions in V3-V5. There was
no prior EKG to compare. Serial EKG demonstrated improvement of
ST-depressions. Troponins were negative x 3. CTA was negative
for aortic dissection.
# HIV: Most recent CD4 421, viral load <75 in ___. He is
sexually active with one steady male partner, with whom he has
oral sex with on a regular basis. He had two episodes of
receptive anal sex in the last month, with one episode that was
unprotected with a new partner. He is not sexually active with
his wife. His wife and the rest of his family are unaware of his
HIV diagnosis and MSM status. He does inform his partners of his
HIV status prior to engaging in sexual activity. The patient was
continued on home medications.
# HYPERTENSION: He was continued on losartan and nifedipine.
# DEPRESSION: The patient was continued on citalopram.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUE:
- The patient's family is not aware of his HIV diagnosis and MSM
status.
- Follow up with infectious disease ___ clinic.
- The patient will require weekly blood draws: CBC with
differential, BUN, Cr, vancomycin trough, ESR/CRP. All labs
should be sent to ___ CLINIC at fax # ___.
- Draw labs on ___.
- All questions regarding outpatient parenteral antibiotics
after discharge should be directed to the ___
R.N.s ___ or to the on-call ID fellow when the
clinic is closed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure caring for you at ___
___. You were admitted with left back pain. Your
blood cultures grew bacteria (Staph Aureus). An MRI of your back
showed the bacteria seeded one of your ribs, which is what
caused your pain. An ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram),
did not show any damage to your heart valves. We are not sure
what caused the bacteria in the blood in the first place.
Regardless, we started you on IV antibiotics (vancomycin), for
which you will continue for 6 weeks. You will also follow up
with the infectious disease doctors. In terms of working, there
are no restrictions as long as you are able to administer your
antibiotics. Please see below for medication changes and follow
up appointments.
We are glad you are feeling better and we wish you the best.
Your ___ team

History of Present Illness:
___ yo F with h/o CAD s/p CABG, chronic CHF and recent bowel 
surgery presents with hypotension now tx from ___ (orig 
from ___ rehab). Per ___, BP has been low for several 
days, now not responsive to fluids. She was found overnight to 
systolics reportedly as low as ___ ? still mentating. 
Thereafter, she was transferred to ___ where she 
received 4L IVFs as well as IV zosyn. Patient was alert and 
oriented x3, code status was discussed with patient who stated 
DNR/DNI and that she doesnt want central line even if 
lifesaving. This was confirmed with her niece who is HCP, who 
states that her aunt discussed with her DNR and confirms. Thus, 
she was started on levophed through right PICC (placed prior to 
presentation, but unclear when) and was transferred to ___ ED 
for further management.  
.  
Of note, she has a hx of recent rectocolectomy for rectal perf 
with small bowel prolapse (2 feet of bowel resected) at ___. 
___ and has ostomy and choleostomy bag (placed for acalculus 
cholecystitis). Post op course was complicated by wound 
infection, pneumonia, c. diff and right hip cellulitis. She was 
treated periop with levofloxacin, flagyl and keflex. Discharge 
summary from ___ recommends course of keflex to end on 
___, levofloxacin to end on ___ and flagyl to be continued 
through ___. Her transfer record only lists flagyl as 
antibiotic so it is unclear whether she received full courses of 
these meds.  
.  
In the ED here, initial vitals were T: 95.4 BP: 116/88 HR: 100 
RR: 26 O2 sat: 100% (unclear amount supplemental O2). Labs were 
notable for creatinine of 2.7 (CRI, but unclear baseline), 
bicarb of 10, and initial venous pH of 7.08 which improved 
slightly to 7.11 prior to transfer. Lactate was normal at 1.4. 
Initial glucose drawn from her PICC was 546 however this was 
thought d/t dextrose delivered through her PICC at ___ 
for hypoglycemia as repeats without intervention normalized. 
Arterial line placement was attempted in ? left wrist (with 
doppler) however pt extremely edemetous so attempt was 
unsuccessful. UA was not sent. CXR demonstrated hiatal hernia, 
cardiomegaly and inadequately characterized retrocardiac 
opacity. CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained which demonstrated 
transverse colon herniation into chest and small amount of free 
fluid within pelvis and perisplenic; viability of tissue in 
hernia could not be evaluated per radiology prelim read, however 
surgery evaluated imaging and suspect source is most likely 
intraabdominal, but patient adamantly refused surgical 
intervention. She received 1g IV vanco and 500mg flagyl as well 
as 25mcg fentanyl for back pain (it does not appear by 
documentation that she received any additional IVFs) and is now 
being admitted to the ICU for further management of hypotension. 
 
.  
Currently she reports generally feeling unwell, fatigued and 
complains of extremely dry mouth. She endorses productive cough. 
She denies significant SOB. She has no CP/palps. She endorses 
low back pain which she says is chronic. She denies abdominal 
pain and is unsure if her ostomy output has changed. She denies 
dysuria or urinary urgency. She denies rashes. She denies focal 
numbness, tingling, weakness (just marked generalized weakness).

Pertinent Results:
# CARDIOLOGY

___ Cardiac Catheterization
.................

___ TTE
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) 
secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior, 
posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex. Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal 
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is not well 
seen. The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic 
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to prior study of ___, left ventricular 
ejection fraction and mitral regurgitation now much worse.

# RADIOLOGY

___ ULTRASOUND OF RIGHT FEMORAL CATH SITE
IMPRESSION: Small collateral coming off the right common femoral 
artery, but no evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm. No 
evidence of hematoma.

___ CXR (PA/Lat)
IMPRESSION: 
1. Mildly improved interstitial edema. 2. Small bilateral 
pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity which may 
represent atelectasis, although consolidation cannot be 
excluded.

___
ECHO
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. 
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with mild aneurysm/akinesis of the basal inferior 
septum, inferior, and inferolateral walls, and hypokinesis of 
the more distal inferior , distal lateral, and apical segments. 
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The aortic 
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
there has been interim improvement in systolic function of the 
distal ___ of the inferior/inferolateral wall and global 
LVEF.

((LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA 'y' graft to OM 'Y' graft to PDA), CKD with 
baseline Cr of 2.6 transferred to CCU in setting of ACS/MI s/p 
DES x2 to native LCx.

# STEMI/CAD: Patient presented with ACS/STEMI with elevated 
cardiac enzymes and an uninterpretable EKG. Cardiac 
catheterization revealed a 95% occlusion proximally in the LCx 
with filling defect/thrombus; the patient received ___ 2. 
CK-MB peaked at 15.8.  She has been chest pain free since cath. 
Post-cath, she was noted to have a femoral bruit, however there 
was no evidence of aneursym on right groin ultrasound. Patient 
received aspirin 325mg, Plavix 75mg and atorvastatin 80mg. She 
was started on metoprolol which was continued on discharge. She 
was not started on an ace inhibitor ___ given acute on 
chronic renal failure. Given the extent of her  mitral valve 
disease, surgery was consulted for the possibility of MVR but 
she was deemed not to be a suitable candidate. Her dysfunction 
will be managed medically.

# Acute on chronic CHF: Patient was in acute on chronic 
congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema on chest xray. 
Diuresis is difficult secondary to acute on chronic renal 
failure. O2 requirement increased overnight. TTE on ___ showed 
left ventricular systolic function that was severely depressed 
(LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the 
inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex. Patient 
received a Lasix drip with additional doses of metolazone and 
diuril given to augment urine output. Repeat chest xray showed 
mild improvement in pulmonary edema. In order to improve her 
cardiac output, she was started on digoxin (+ ionotropic effect) 
and metoprolol (to decrease HR and improve Cardiac output). Her 
Pacemaker settings were changed to decrease AV delay to 150ms to 
provide more effective atrial kick. She was continued on low 
dose digoxin.  Her lasix gtt was converted to torsemide PO, she 
was discharged on Torsemide 60mg PO Daily.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine was elevated 
(baseline Cr 2.6, now 4.0), likely secondary contrast-induced 
nephropathy secondary to dye load from cardiac catheterization. 
We expect creatinine to peak at 48-72 hours post-exposure. No 
electrolyte abnormalities currently. Medications were renally 
dosed. Fractional excretion of urea was <30%, which indicated a 
pre-renal component as well. Urine culture showed 2 epis, sm 
leuk, 3 WBC, few bacteria, 14 hyaline casts. Her Cr improved 
slightly with diuresis to 3.7 but essentially stabalized close 
to 4. She will need further monitoring and workup of her renal 
failure after discharge.

# Leukocytosis: WBC increased from 8.1 to 11.6. Had elevated 
temperature but not true fever, and it spontaneously resolved. 
No bandemia on differerential. She had an infectious workup 
which included urinalysis and culture as well as a chest xray. 
Lipase was within normal limits.

# Nausea: Patient had intermittent nausea which resolved with 
ondansetron. Etiology unclear.

# Hyperlipidemia: Chronic. Patient is currently receiving 
atorvastatin 80mg daily.  Her gemfibrozil was held in setting of 
high-dose atorvastatin. She was discharged on atorvastatin 80mg 
daily

# Rash/Allergy: She developped an itchy maculopapular rash that 
progressed to cover her entire body. Dermatology was consulted 
and they recommended clobetasol cream BID which she is 
continuing on discharge. Her reaction was thought ___ either 
metolazone or diuril which she received slightly prior to the 
rash.

# GERD: Chronic, stable. Omeprazole was discontinued and patient 
was started on famotidine instead.

# Anemia: Chronic; patient receives Procrit injections twice a 
month and is on folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. Her 
hematocrit trended down; etiology unclear. and she was 
transfused with 1U pRBCs on ___. She was started on iron 
supplementation in addition to folic acid & vit B12. She 
received a similar dose of Procrit based on hospital dosing, but 
should resume her previous dosing of Procrit upon discharge. 

# Gout: Stable. Allopurinol was stopped temporarily given 
worsening renal function.

# Diet: Patient was on a diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium, 
low potassium diet.

# DVT Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this 
admission.

# Code status: her code status was discussed and changed to DNR 
but okay to intubate.

Discharge Instructions:
You had a heart attack and required two drug eluting stents be 
placed in your left circumflex artery. Your heart function is 
weaker now so we adjusted your medicines and geve you diuretics 
to get rid of the extra fluid. Your kidney function is worse so 
we stopped some medicines until after your kidneys improve. Your 
blood pressure was low but is normal now after medication 
adjustment. You tallked to a cardiac surgeon about fixing your 
mitral valve but surgery is not a safe option for you so you 
will continue to be treated with medicines to help your heart 
work as efficiently as possible.

least one year. Do not stop taking these medicines unless Dr. 
___ it is OK to do so. 
4. Stop taking Prilosec, aldactone, allopurinol, calcitriol, 
lopid and diovan. You should restart these medicines when your 
kidneys improve. 
5. Start taking potassium daily to increase your potassium 
levels
6. STart taking Heparin injections until you are walking 
regularly to prevent blood clots
7. Start taking colace, senna, miralax and bisacodyl to prevent 
constipation
8. STart Sevelamer to decrease your phosphate levels. Stop 
Calcitriol for now. Dr. ___ adjust these medicines

Pertinent Results:
# CARDIOLOGY
___ Cardiac Catheterization
.................
___ TTE
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %)
secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior,
posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is not well
seen. The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to prior study of ___, left ventricular
ejection fraction and mitral regurgitation now much worse.
# RADIOLOGY
___ ULTRASOUND OF RIGHT FEMORAL CATH SITE
IMPRESSION: Small collateral coming off the right common femoral
artery, but no evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm. No
evidence of hematoma.
___ CXR (PA/Lat)
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly improved interstitial edema. 2. Small bilateral
pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity which may
represent atelectasis, although consolidation cannot be
excluded.
___
ECHO
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild aneurysm/akinesis of the basal inferior
septum, inferior, and inferolateral walls, and hypokinesis of
the more distal inferior , distal lateral, and apical segments.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The aortic
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___,
there has been interim improvement in systolic function of the
distal ___ of the inferior/inferolateral wall and global
LVEF.

((LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA 'y' graft to OM 'Y' graft to PDA), CKD with
baseline Cr of 2.6 transferred to CCU in setting of ACS/MI s/p
DES x2 to native LCx.
# STEMI/CAD: Patient presented with ACS/STEMI with elevated
cardiac enzymes and an uninterpretable EKG. Cardiac
catheterization revealed a 95% occlusion proximally in the LCx
with filling defect/thrombus; the patient received ___ 2.
CK-MB peaked at 15.8. She has been chest pain free since cath.
Post-cath, she was noted to have a femoral bruit, however there
was no evidence of aneursym on right groin ultrasound. Patient
received aspirin 325mg, Plavix 75mg and atorvastatin 80mg. She
was started on metoprolol which was continued on discharge. She
was not started on an ace inhibitor ___ given acute on
chronic renal failure. Given the extent of her mitral valve
disease, surgery was consulted for the possibility of MVR but
she was deemed not to be a suitable candidate. Her dysfunction
will be managed medically.
# Acute on chronic CHF: Patient was in acute on chronic
congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema on chest xray.
Diuresis is difficult secondary to acute on chronic renal
failure. O2 requirement increased overnight. TTE on ___ showed
left ventricular systolic function that was severely depressed
(LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the
inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex. Patient
received a Lasix drip with additional doses of metolazone and
diuril given to augment urine output. Repeat chest xray showed
mild improvement in pulmonary edema. In order to improve her
cardiac output, she was started on digoxin (+ ionotropic effect)
and metoprolol (to decrease HR and improve Cardiac output). Her
Pacemaker settings were changed to decrease AV delay to 150ms to
provide more effective atrial kick. She was continued on low
dose digoxin. Her lasix gtt was converted to torsemide PO, she
was discharged on Torsemide 60mg PO Daily.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine was elevated
(baseline Cr 2.6, now 4.0), likely secondary contrast-induced
nephropathy secondary to dye load from cardiac catheterization.
We expect creatinine to peak at 48-72 hours post-exposure. No
electrolyte abnormalities currently. Medications were renally
dosed. Fractional excretion of urea was <30%, which indicated a
pre-renal component as well. Urine culture showed 2 epis, sm
leuk, 3 WBC, few bacteria, 14 hyaline casts. Her Cr improved
slightly with diuresis to 3.7 but essentially stabalized close
to 4. She will need further monitoring and workup of her renal
failure after discharge.
# Leukocytosis: WBC increased from 8.1 to 11.6. Had elevated
temperature but not true fever, and it spontaneously resolved.
No bandemia on differerential. She had an infectious workup
which included urinalysis and culture as well as a chest xray.
Lipase was within normal limits.
# Nausea: Patient had intermittent nausea which resolved with
ondansetron. Etiology unclear.
# Hyperlipidemia: Chronic. Patient is currently receiving
atorvastatin 80mg daily. Her gemfibrozil was held in setting of
high-dose atorvastatin. She was discharged on atorvastatin 80mg
daily
# Rash/Allergy: She developped an itchy maculopapular rash that
progressed to cover her entire body. Dermatology was consulted
and they recommended clobetasol cream BID which she is
continuing on discharge. Her reaction was thought ___ either
metolazone or diuril which she received slightly prior to the
rash.
# GERD: Chronic, stable. Omeprazole was discontinued and patient
was started on famotidine instead.
# Anemia: Chronic; patient receives Procrit injections twice a
month and is on folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. Her
hematocrit trended down; etiology unclear. and she was
transfused with 1U pRBCs on ___. She was started on iron
supplementation in addition to folic acid & vit B12. She
received a similar dose of Procrit based on hospital dosing, but
should resume her previous dosing of Procrit upon discharge.
# Gout: Stable. Allopurinol was stopped temporarily given
worsening renal function.
# Diet: Patient was on a diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium,
low potassium diet.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this
admission.
# Code status: her code status was discussed and changed to DNR
but okay to intubate.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo female with severe asthma and
sarcoidosis (biopsy proven). She had bronchothermoplasty done in
___ (RLL), ___ (LLL), ___ (RUL and LUL) with
improvement of clearing secretions, but no decrease in
inflammation. CT trachea ___ noted tracheobronchomalacia
involving the lower trachea, bilateral main and bronchus
intermedius; upper trachea and lobar bronchi changed in
dimension insignificantly; moderately severe air trapping on
expiration, individual contribution of TBM and small airways
disease cannot be determined. Failed stent trial in ___ due 
to
inability to clear secretions. She underwent stent trial ___
with 3 metal stents placed in bil BI, LMS, and distal trachea.
Had a positive stent trial and TBP was recommended. Was last 
seen
in clinic ___. Presents today for follow up.

Pt reports that she ended up deferring having the TBP because 
she
is worried that it will not help her symptoms. She feels as
though inflammation is her main problem. Is frequently on 60mg
prednisone tapers. Took prednisone 20mg the other day for 
symptom
relief. She says she does require occasional antibiotics, but 
has
not needed them for a couple of months. No recent
hospitalizations. Denies current fevers/chills/sweats. Main
respiratory symptoms are dyspnea and cough. Uses acetylcysteine
20%, nebulized, frequently. Sometimes adds albuterol and
budesonide as well. She says this is a time-consuming process,
but does help her clear her secretions. Secretions vary in 
color,
sometimes a deep yellow, sometimes brown, sometimes white. On
occasion she will have a ""tiny"" bit of blood in her secretions
and she notes this happens when ""excessively"" coughing. She 
finds
her symptoms greatly impact when she's able to do. She can no
longer cross country ski or hike very far. She says her heart
starts pounding when she walks up stairs. Occasionally has
R-sided chest pain, which is not new. She notes that she has had

___ CXR :
There is a right medial pleural catheter and a surgical drain 
projecting over the mediastinum.  Biapical pleuroparenchymal 
scarring is noted.  There are patchy opacities in the right 
upper lobe and left lung base, which may represent infectious or 
inflammatory changes.  There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in 
appearance.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  
Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along the right chest wall 

___ CXR :
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Loculated right pleural 
effusion is unchanged.  There is interval improvement in the 
right lung base aeration as well as decrease in the subcutaneous 
air within the right chest wall.  Left lung is clear.  There is 
no change in the left basal/lingular atelectasis. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where she underwent a right thoracotomy and 
tracheobronchoplasty with mesh and bronchoscopy with lavage. She 
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the TSICU in stable 
condition. She maintained stable hemodynamics and her pain was 
controlled with an epidural. Her ___ drain put out a modest 
amount of fluid and had no air leak.  She underwent vigorous 
pulmonary toilet including chest ___, nebulizers and incentive 
spirometry and her oxygen saturations were in the 95% range on 2 
liters.  She had no dysphagia post op and her diet was slowly 
advanced from sips to regular which she tolerated well.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor her ___ drain was 
removed on post op day #2 as the drainage was minimal and there 
was no air leak.  Her epidural was removed on post op day #4 as 
it migrated out of position and she had better pain control with 
oral narcotics and Tylenol.  Her right thoracotomy site was 
healing well. 

Her pulmonary status improved daily and her congestion had 
slowly resolved with the help of Mucomyst nebulizers and 
Mucinex.  The Interventional Pulmonary service evaluated her as 
she was concerned that her right incisional pain had increased 
and wondered if it was from her small right pleural effusion. An 
ultrasound was done on ___ which showed a small right 
pleural effusion, too small to drain and unlikely the cause of 
her pain.  her Gabapentin was increased from 200 mg TID to ___ 
mg TID and she continued with Oxycodone, Lidoderm patch and 
Tylenol. She was encouraged to wean the oxycodone down in a few 
days and she will also continue her mucomyst nebulizers.  Her 
ambulatory room air saturations were 94%.  She was discharged to 
home on ___ and will follow up with Dr. ___ in 2 
weeks.

___ CXR :
There is a right medial pleural catheter and a surgical drain
projecting over the mediastinum. Biapical pleuroparenchymal
scarring is noted. There are patchy opacities in the right
upper lobe and left lung base, which may represent infectious or
inflammatory changes. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in
appearance. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along the right chest wall
___ CXR :
Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Loculated right pleural
effusion is unchanged. There is interval improvement in the
right lung base aeration as well as decrease in the subcutaneous
air within the right chest wall. Left lung is clear. There is
no change in the left basal/lingular atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a right thoracotomy and
tracheobronchoplasty with mesh and bronchoscopy with lavage. She
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the TSICU in stable
condition. She maintained stable hemodynamics and her pain was
controlled with an epidural. Her ___ drain put out a modest
amount of fluid and had no air leak. She underwent vigorous
pulmonary toilet including chest ___, nebulizers and incentive
spirometry and her oxygen saturations were in the 95% range on 2
liters. She had no dysphagia post op and her diet was slowly
advanced from sips to regular which she tolerated well.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor her ___ drain was
removed on post op day #2 as the drainage was minimal and there
was no air leak. Her epidural was removed on post op day #4 as
it migrated out of position and she had better pain control with
oral narcotics and Tylenol. Her right thoracotomy site was
healing well.
Her pulmonary status improved daily and her congestion had
slowly resolved with the help of Mucomyst nebulizers and
Mucinex. The Interventional Pulmonary service evaluated her as
she was concerned that her right incisional pain had increased
and wondered if it was from her small right pleural effusion. An
ultrasound was done on ___ which showed a small right
pleural effusion, too small to drain and unlikely the cause of
her pain. her Gabapentin was increased from 200 mg TID to ___
mg TID and she continued with Oxycodone, Lidoderm patch and
Tylenol. She was encouraged to wean the oxycodone down in a few
days and she will also continue her mucomyst nebulizers. Her
ambulatory room air saturations were 94%. She was discharged to
home on ___ and will follow up with Dr. ___ in 2
weeks.

ECHO ___

CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global 
left ventricular systolic function.
Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular ejection fraction is 
57 % (normal 54-73%). Left
ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). Global 
longitudinal strain is depressed (-16.7 %;
normal less than -18%) Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP
greater than 18 mmHg). There is Grade II diastolic dysfunction. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size
with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus is mildly dilated 
with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated with a normal descending aorta 
diameter. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened with fusion of the non/left raphe. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. There is no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is mild [1+] mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear
structurally normal. There is trivial tricuspid regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be estimated. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 1) Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal regional and radial
global contractile function (as measured by LVEF). Global 
longitudinal strain is low normal to
mildly reduced in setting of moderate systemic systolic arterial 
hypertension. 2)
Echocardiographic evidence for diastolic dysfunction with 
elevated PCWP.

ECHO ___
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global
left ventricular systolic function.
Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular ejection fraction is
57 % (normal 54-73%). Left
ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). Global
longitudinal strain is depressed (-16.7 %;
normal less than -18%) Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP
greater than 18 mmHg). There is Grade II diastolic dysfunction.
Normal right ventricular cavity size
with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus is mildly dilated
with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated with a normal descending aorta
diameter. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened with fusion of the non/left raphe. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. There is no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild [1+] mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear
structurally normal. There is trivial tricuspid regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be estimated. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 1) Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal regional and radial
global contractile function (as measured by LVEF). Global
longitudinal strain is low normal to
mildly reduced in setting of moderate systemic systolic arterial
hypertension. 2)
Echocardiographic evidence for diastolic dysfunction with
elevated PCWP.

History of Present Illness:
___ yo female with history of panhypopituitarism ___ pituitary 
adenoma s/p radiation therapy (remote) presents with nausea and 
diarrhea for the last two days.  She was found by her mother 
this morning feeling fatigued, weak, dizzy, and with lots of 
diarrhea.  Diarrhea described to be liquid brown stool.  Mother 
reports that she had to clean her about 3 times before coming to 
the ED.  No fevers or chills at home.  No cough, rhinitis, 
myalgia.  EMS was called, on arrival, her BP was 63/50 with HR 
of 110.  She received 1 L of IVF in the field with her systolics 
improving to 73. 
.  
In the ED, initial vitals were: 114, 63/37, 16.  Her exam was 
notable for RUQ/LUQ tendnerness to palpation.  Surgery evaluated 
the patient, who did not recommend any surgical intervention as 
there was no acute abdominal process seen on CT scan or KUB.  
RUQ bedside ultrasound was performed which showed 8cm x 3cm 
gallbladder (upper limit of normal), and collapsed IVC.
.
Patient was initially bolused with 4 L of IV fluids without any 
improvement to her BP.  She was then given hydrocortisone 100mg 
IV, solumedrol 125 mg, cipro, flagyl, and vancomycin.  She was 
bolused with another 2L, for a total of 6 L of IV fluids, but 
blood pressure remained low in  the ___.  She was then started 
on levophed, blood pressures still low, then subsequently neo 
was started.  Her SBPs responded to the 110-120's.  She was then 
able to be weaned off of neo, with BP remaining in the 
110-120's.  Lactate improved from 6.2 to 3.3 with fluid 
resuscitation.  Potassium was high at 6.7, received insulin 10 
units with D50 and IV fluids as well as 4g of calcium gluconate, 
repeat potassium was improved to 4.9.  Patient was transiently 
hypoxic with SpO2 of 88% on NRB, ABG at that time was 
7.20/33/118.  Her respiratory status gradually improved to 
saturating in the high 90's on 2L of O2 by ___.  Labs also 
notable for creatinine of 5.0 which has already improved to 4.0 
with IV fluids.  Renal was consulted in the ED, but has not yet 
left recommendations.  Patient had a left femoral CVL placed 
under ultrasound guidance as IJ's were both small and difficult 
anatomically.  Vital signs prior to transfer were: 105, 120/66, 
21, 97% 2L.  Patient reported to be mentating well despite low 
blood pressures.
.  
She had ___ more episodes of liquid brown stool in the emergency 
room.
.
On the floor, patient appears very fatigued, not very 
interactive.  Able to be aroused but falls asleep almost 
immediately.  Not complaining of abdominal pain.  Nods head when 
asked if she feels dizzy.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Adrenal insufficiency/Hypotension - Patient has history of 
panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary adenoma s/p radiation 
therapy.  On hormonal replacement at home.  Her symptoms of 
hypotension likely due to acute adrenal insufficiency, as she 
has been sick recently which represents an additional stressor, 
and her body was unable to compensate.  Patient's BP improved 
following pressors initiation and steroid administration in the 
ED.  No signs of active infections to suggest sepsis.  She was 
able to be weaned off of neosynephrine very quickly suggesting 
the steroids were effective in treating her hypotension.  
Dehydration likely also contributing to hypotension. Weaned off 
pressors completely on the night of admission.  Started on 
hydrocortisone 100 mg q8h, and continued on desmopressin.  
Endocrine consult obtained and recommended decreasing 
hydrocortisone to 50mg q8h for 2 days and then the patient was 
eventually weaned down to her home dose of hydrocortisone 10mg 
PO am and 5mg PO pm.  Her blood pressure remained stable on her 
home dose and PO fluidsand it was felt she was stable and ready 
for discharge with follow up with her PCP, ___.  Her 
desmopressin and levothyroxine for panhypopituitarism was 
continued throughout the course of her hospital stay.
.
# Transaminitis - Acute increase LFTs was likely ___ hypotension 
in the setting of chronic liver disease. Pt presented with ALT 
72, AST 244, lipase 99.  LFTs peaked at ALT 308 AST 803 and then 
downtrended as BP stabilized. Patient does have history of NASH 
followed at ___. RUQ u/s showed fatty infiltration, nodularity, 
evidence of portal HTN.  Pt LFT trended down during her hospital 
stay.  Given her elevated LFT, we did not restart her metformin 
at time of discharge 
.
Daibetes: Pt metformin was held and she was started on an 
insulin sliding scale.  Given Ms. ___ elevated transaminitis 
in the setting of shock liver, her metformin was not restarted 
at the time of discharge.  We advised her to make an appointment 
with her endocrinologist within 2 weeks who would repeat her lab 
work and decide how to continue to manage her diabetes at that 
time.  
.
# Hyperkalemia - presented with K of 6.7, improved to 4.0 with 
fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone.  Likely ___ to acute 
renal failure.  After the initial correction, hyperkalemia was 
not an issue during this admission.
.
# Acute renal failure - presented with creatinine of 5.0, 
improved to 1.1 with IV fluids, stress dose steroids and 
pressors.  Her creatinine was stable at 0.9 at the time of 
discharge.  
.
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea - Most likley represents viral 
gastroenteritis. no fevers at home.  continued to be afebrile 
during the course of her hospital stay.  She had liquid diarrhea 
in the ED and c-diff was negative.  At the time of discharge she 
was having formed stools.
.
# ?PNA - CXR with RUL opacity (aspiration vs atalectasis), 
abdominal XR without any intraabdominal processes.  CT abdomen 
showed some bibasilar atelectasis vs aspiration.  Received 
cipro, flagyl, and vancomycin in the ED, but no overt symptoms 
of pneumonia.  Antibiotics were not continued in the MICU. 
Respiratory status remained stable throughout her hospital stay. 

.
# Fatigue - mother says that patient often will tune other 
people out when she is feeling sick.  However, patient initially 
appeared very fatigued, falling asleep during conversation, very 
limited attention.  Per mother, patient is usually much more 
interactive and lively.  TFT's were unremarkable. On second day 
of admission patient showed marked improvement, conversing, 
alert, able to get out of bed with assistance. Pt remained alert 
and interactive for the rest of her hospital stay.
.  
# Seizure - mother reports that she has seizures nearly every 
day lasting ___ seconds.  They are characterized with her 
repeating words, no shaking. Carbamezapine home dose was 
continued.  Pt did not have any seizures while in the MICU or on 
the medicine floor
.
# ?HTN - lisinopril held given ARF and hypotension.  Her 
creatinine returned to baseline and her BP stabilized in the 
MICU and remained stable on the floor.  Her lisinopril was 
restarted at time of discharge.  According to her PCP, 
lisinopril was started for renal protection not for 
hypertension.
.
# ?Anxiety - buspirone continued at daily dosing as opposed to 
BID given acute renal failure.  At the time of discharge she was 
told to restart her BID doseing.

Discharge Instructions:
You are being discharged from ___ 
___.  You were admitted on ___ for dehydration from 
vomiting and diarrhea and had extremely low blood pressures that 
you required more than 9 liters of fluid placed into your veins 
and two types of  medicine (pressors and steroids) that keep the 
blood pressure elevated.  You needed this blood pressure support 
for a short period of time and eventually you were doing well 
withoout the fluids, but was still getting high dose steroids 
for help with your blood pressure.  You were transferred from 
the intensive care unit to the regular floor for further care.  
While on the regular floor, we lowered your hydrocortisone back 
to your home dose of 10mg in the morning and 5mg in the 
afternoon.  
.
In the setting of your dehydration and low blood pressures your 
had some shock to your liver and your liver enzymes rose 
significantly.  We cannot restart your metformin because your 
liver enzymes are high and so it was decided that your metformin 
was held and endocrine decided that you should not resume 
metformin until you are seen by an endocrinologist. please make 
an appointment to be seen by your endocrinologist in the next 
two weeks.

notable for RUQ/LUQ tendnerness to palpation. Surgery evaluated
the patient, who did not recommend any surgical intervention as
there was no acute abdominal process seen on CT scan or KUB.
RUQ bedside ultrasound was performed which showed 8cm x 3cm
gallbladder (upper limit of normal), and collapsed IVC.
.
Patient was initially bolused with 4 L of IV fluids without any
improvement to her BP. She was then given hydrocortisone 100mg
IV, solumedrol 125 mg, cipro, flagyl, and vancomycin. She was
bolused with another 2L, for a total of 6 L of IV fluids, but
blood pressure remained low in the ___. She was then started
on levophed, blood pressures still low, then subsequently neo
was started. Her SBPs responded to the 110-120's. She was then
able to be weaned off of neo, with BP remaining in the
110-120's. Lactate improved from 6.2 to 3.3 with fluid
resuscitation. Potassium was high at 6.7, received insulin 10
units with D50 and IV fluids as well as 4g of calcium gluconate,
repeat potassium was improved to 4.9. Patient was transiently
hypoxic with SpO2 of 88% on NRB, ABG at that time was
7.20/33/118. Her respiratory status gradually improved to
saturating in the high 90's on 2L of O2 by ___. Labs also
notable for creatinine of 5.0 which has already improved to 4.0
with IV fluids. Renal was consulted in the ED, but has not yet
left recommendations. Patient had a left femoral CVL placed
under ultrasound guidance as IJ's were both small and difficult
anatomically. Vital signs prior to transfer were: 105, 120/66,
21, 97% 2L. Patient reported to be mentating well despite low
blood pressures.
.
She had ___ more episodes of liquid brown stool in the emergency
room.
.
On the floor, patient appears very fatigued, not very
interactive. Able to be aroused but falls asleep almost
immediately. Not complaining of abdominal pain. Nods head when
asked if she feels dizzy.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Adrenal insufficiency/Hypotension - Patient has history of
panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary adenoma s/p radiation
therapy. On hormonal replacement at home. Her symptoms of
hypotension likely due to acute adrenal insufficiency, as she
has been sick recently which represents an additional stressor,
and her body was unable to compensate. Patient's BP improved
following pressors initiation and steroid administration in the
ED. No signs of active infections to suggest sepsis. She was
able to be weaned off of neosynephrine very quickly suggesting
the steroids were effective in treating her hypotension.
Dehydration likely also contributing to hypotension. Weaned off
pressors completely on the night of admission. Started on
hydrocortisone 100 mg q8h, and continued on desmopressin.
Endocrine consult obtained and recommended decreasing
hydrocortisone to 50mg q8h for 2 days and then the patient was
eventually weaned down to her home dose of hydrocortisone 10mg
PO am and 5mg PO pm. Her blood pressure remained stable on her
home dose and PO fluidsand it was felt she was stable and ready
for discharge with follow up with her PCP, ___. Her
desmopressin and levothyroxine for panhypopituitarism was
continued throughout the course of her hospital stay.
.
# Transaminitis - Acute increase LFTs was likely ___ hypotension
in the setting of chronic liver disease. Pt presented with ALT
72, AST 244, lipase 99. LFTs peaked at ALT 308 AST 803 and then
downtrended as BP stabilized. Patient does have history of NASH
followed at ___. RUQ u/s showed fatty infiltration, nodularity,
evidence of portal HTN. Pt LFT trended down during her hospital
stay. Given her elevated LFT, we did not restart her metformin
at time of discharge
.
Daibetes: Pt metformin was held and she was started on an
insulin sliding scale. Given Ms. ___ elevated transaminitis
in the setting of shock liver, her metformin was not restarted
at the time of discharge. We advised her to make an appointment
with her endocrinologist within 2 weeks who would repeat her lab
work and decide how to continue to manage her diabetes at that
time.
.
# Hyperkalemia - presented with K of 6.7, improved to 4.0 with
fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone. Likely ___ to acute
renal failure. After the initial correction, hyperkalemia was
not an issue during this admission.
.
# Acute renal failure - presented with creatinine of 5.0,
improved to 1.1 with IV fluids, stress dose steroids and
pressors. Her creatinine was stable at 0.9 at the time of
discharge.
.
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea - Most likley represents viral
gastroenteritis. no fevers at home. continued to be afebrile
during the course of her hospital stay. She had liquid diarrhea
in the ED and c-diff was negative. At the time of discharge she
was having formed stools.
.
# ?PNA - CXR with RUL opacity (aspiration vs atalectasis),
abdominal XR without any intraabdominal processes. CT abdomen
showed some bibasilar atelectasis vs aspiration. Received
cipro, flagyl, and vancomycin in the ED, but no overt symptoms
of pneumonia. Antibiotics were not continued in the MICU.
Respiratory status remained stable throughout her hospital stay.
.
# Fatigue - mother says that patient often will tune other
people out when she is feeling sick. However, patient initially
appeared very fatigued, falling asleep during conversation, very
limited attention. Per mother, patient is usually much more
interactive and lively. TFT's were unremarkable. On second day
of admission patient showed marked improvement, conversing,
alert, able to get out of bed with assistance. Pt remained alert
and interactive for the rest of her hospital stay.
.
# Seizure - mother reports that she has seizures nearly every
day lasting ___ seconds. They are characterized with her
repeating words, no shaking. Carbamezapine home dose was
continued. Pt did not have any seizures while in the MICU or on
the medicine floor
.
# ?HTN - lisinopril held given ARF and hypotension. Her
creatinine returned to baseline and her BP stabilized in the
MICU and remained stable on the floor. Her lisinopril was
restarted at time of discharge. According to her PCP,
lisinopril was started for renal protection not for
hypertension.
.
# ?Anxiety - buspirone continued at daily dosing as opposed to
BID given acute renal failure. At the time of discharge she was
told to restart her BID doseing.

#Chronic Abdominal Pain. Ms. ___ has been having chronic 
abdominal pain for several months which has resulted in nearly 
30lb weight loss. She reports that she is unable to consume 
meals by mouth aside from coffee and occasional bites of fruit. 
She has had an extensive work up as an outpatient with no clear 
etiology identified. NJ tube was placed on ___ and tube 
feeds initiated without incident. She reached her goal rate on 
___. She underwent endoscopic ultrasound and EGD which was 
unremarkable. MRE revealed mild prominence of the CBD (which is 
likely related to her cholecystectomy). GI was consulted, 
thought that her current presentation can be explained by 
narcotic bowel syndrome, with frequently recurring abdominal 
pain that worsens with continued or escalating doses of 
narcotics. They have advised slow weaning from her opiate 
regimen and replacement with alternative pain modalities. DDx 
for her abdominal pain include adrenal insufficiency (AM 
cortisol normal), porphyria (urine porphobilinogen negative), 
angioedema (C4 negative), and lead poisoning.

She has a follow up nutrition appointment scheduled for ___, 
___ with her dietician. Her pain was treated with her home 
pain regimen: PO hydromorphone 2mg q6 PRN, PO oxycodone 5mg q6h 
PRN, duloxetine 60 mg, and ondansetron 4mg q8 prn for nausea.

#GERD. She was continued on her home omeprazole.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for placement of a feeding 
tube as well as tests to better understand the cause of your 
abdominal pain.  You had an NJ (___) tube placed by 
interventional radiology and have been started on tube feeds.  
To evaluate your abdominal pain you underwent a MRI of your 
small bowel which showed mild prominence of your common bile 
duct which can be seen if your gallbladder is taken out. There 
are no other abnormalities seen on your MRI. You also underwent 
an endoscopic ultrasound to evaluate your pancreas which did not 
show any abnormalities. The exact cause of your abdominal pain 
remains unclear.

On discharge, please follow up immediately with your registered 
dietician to help determine your nutritional needs. We will 
include a copy of your nutrition evaluation to help you and your 
dietician. You should also be sure to follow-up with your 
primary care doctor Dr. ___: ___ within the 
next week.

It was a pleasure taking care of you,
Your ___ team

IMAGING
=======
MRE (___): Mild CBD prominence, possibly related to
cholecystectomy. Otherwise, unremarkable MR enterography.
UPPER EUS (___):
Impression: The ampulla was normal.
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz
frequency: The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the
duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body and tail
[partially] were imaged from the gastric body and fundus.
Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma in the entire pancreas was
homogenous, with a normal salt and pepper appearance. Few
hyperechoic strands were noted - over all pancreas was within
normal limits.

of the pancreas and ampulla. The maximum diameter of the bile
duct was 5 mm. The bile duct was normal in appearance. No
intrinsic stones or sludge were noted. The bile duct and the
pancreatic duct were imaged within the ampulla and appeared
normal.
Otherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Over all pancreas was normal.
Follow-up with refering physicians as already scheduled.

#Chronic Abdominal Pain. Ms. ___ has been having chronic
abdominal pain for several months which has resulted in nearly
30lb weight loss. She reports that she is unable to consume
meals by mouth aside from coffee and occasional bites of fruit.
She has had an extensive work up as an outpatient with no clear
etiology identified. NJ tube was placed on ___ and tube
feeds initiated without incident. She reached her goal rate on
___. She underwent endoscopic ultrasound and EGD which was
unremarkable. MRE revealed mild prominence of the CBD (which is
likely related to her cholecystectomy). GI was consulted,
thought that her current presentation can be explained by
narcotic bowel syndrome, with frequently recurring abdominal
pain that worsens with continued or escalating doses of
narcotics. They have advised slow weaning from her opiate
regimen and replacement with alternative pain modalities. DDx
for her abdominal pain include adrenal insufficiency (AM
cortisol normal), porphyria (urine porphobilinogen negative),
angioedema (C4 negative), and lead poisoning.
She has a follow up nutrition appointment scheduled for ___,
___ with her dietician. Her pain was treated with her home
pain regimen: PO hydromorphone 2mg q6 PRN, PO oxycodone 5mg q6h
PRN, duloxetine 60 mg, and ondansetron 4mg q8 prn for nausea.
#GERD. She was continued on her home omeprazole.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[ ] Please follow up with your dietician to manage your tube
feeds on discharge
[ ] Consider transitioning to TCA or SNRI and wean narcotics as
outpatient in the event that symptoms are related to narcotic
bowel syndrome
[ ] Consider outpatient heavy metal testing

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from ___ for surgical 
revascularization after ruling in for NSTEMI and cardiac 
catheterization that revealed Left Main and multi vessel disease 
for which and IABP was placed. He was admitted to the CVICU and 
remained pain free on IABP, Nitroglycerin and heparin infusion. 
He underwent routine preoperative evaluation and was cleared for 
surgery.
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. 
___ - see operative note for details. In summary he had: 
Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting x3, with left internal 
mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse 
saphenous vein graft to the ramus intermedius branch and 
diagonal branch. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure 
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. 
He did well post-operatively and was extubated shortly after 
arrival to CVICU. POD 1 found the patient alert, oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  All chest tubes, lines and pacing wires were 
discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.  
Once on the stepdown floor the patient worked with nursing and 
was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance 
with strength and mobility. The remainder of his hospital stay 
was uneventful.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient 
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was 
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged 
home, to a friend's house, with visiting nurses in good 
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
Of note, the patient does have a history of AAA. Imaging during 
this admission, ___, reveals, ""Infrarenal abdominal aortic 
aneurysm up to 4.3 cm.  Right common iliac artery aneurysm up to 
2.5 cm."" Results communicated to PCP.

dilate in the
mid aorta, and is most dilated in the proximal infrarenal aorta
with distal
tapering such that the diameter of the aorta decreases to 2.5 cm
just before
the bifurcation. The aorta has heavy atherosclerosis throughout,
with a larger
area of thrombus/plaque peripherally in the infrarenal aorta.
The right common iliac artery measures 2.5 cm and the left
common iliac artery
measures 1.2 cm.
The right kidney measures 10.4 cm and the left kidney measures
10.5 cm. There
is a 5.5 x 5.7 x 5.9 cm simple renal cyst in the left mid acute
knee. Limited
views of the kidneys are unremarkable without hydronephrosis.
IMPRESSION:
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm up to 4.3 cm. Right common
iliac artery
aneurysm up to 2.5 cm.
NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ___,
NP, by ___

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from ___ for surgical
revascularization after ruling in for NSTEMI and cardiac
catheterization that revealed Left Main and multi vessel disease
for which and IABP was placed. He was admitted to the CVICU and
remained pain free on IABP, Nitroglycerin and heparin infusion.
He underwent routine preoperative evaluation and was cleared for
surgery.
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where
the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr.
___ - see operative note for details. In summary he had:
Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting x3, with left internal
mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse
saphenous vein graft to the ramus intermedius branch and
diagonal branch. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He did well post-operatively and was extubated shortly after
arrival to CVICU. POD 1 found the patient alert, oriented and
breathing comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. All chest tubes, lines and pacing wires were
discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.
Once on the stepdown floor the patient worked with nursing and
was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility. The remainder of his hospital stay
was uneventful. By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged
home, to a friend's house, with visiting nurses in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
Of note, the patient does have a history of AAA. Imaging during
this admission, ___, reveals, ""Infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm up to 4.3 cm. Right common iliac artery aneurysm up to
2.5 cm."" Results communicated to PCP.

History of Present Illness:
___ year-old right-handed woman with a
history including pituitary microadenoma who presents with a
three month history of symtoms including headache,
lightheadedness, and burning paresthesias.  
.
The patient first began to feel unwell in ___.  She
recalls being seated at work when she started to see ""squiggly
lines"" in both visual fields.  About two hours later she
developed a throbbing bifrontal headache that radiated to the
occipital regions.  The headache rated ___.  There were no 
clear
triggers, exacerbating factors, or other associated symptoms. 
She has had similar headaches in the past, and attributed the
discomfort to stress.
.
The following week she began to have frequent headaches.  She
describes a throbbing discomfort in the bifrontal region that
radiated back to the occipital region.  The headaches rated
___ in intensity.  There was no clear trigger.  There were no
exacerbating factors.  The discomfort was associated with
""pressure"" across the eyes and forehead.  There was no
concomitant nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, photophobia, or
sensorimotor disturbance.  Aspirin and tylenol provided relief.
.
Around the same time, she began to develop dizziness.  She
characterizes the sensation as ""the early buzz with a glass of
wine"" or the feeling one has while getting off a boat.  She 
found
that when she quickly turned her head, it felt as though it took
a moment for her eyes to catch up and adjust.  There was no 
clear
trigger for the sensation such as moving from a stand to a sit,
although the sensation did tend to occur more frequently when 
she
was in the upright position and moving about.  There were no
exacerbating factors, alleviating variable, or associated
symptoms.  It could last all day.
.
For these symptoms, she presented to her PCP who attributed the
symptoms to a sinus infection.  She was prescribed a course of
amoxicillin.  The headache resolved within 24 hours.  However,
because the dizziness did not resolve, she returned to the PCP. 
He prescribed a four-day course of prednisone 40 mg per day.  
.
By early ___, she developed a tingling that predominently
affected the left cheek.  She presented to an ED where a
non-contrast CT of the head was done.  It was reportedly 
negative
except for ""fluid in the nasal cavity.""  She googled her
symptoms, however, and found that multiple sclerosis could be an
explanation.  She says she became panicked at the thought.  That
night, she developed ""burning"" in a band across the back between
the two shoulders.  It did not radiate.  There were no
exacerbating factors or associated symptoms other than the 
facial
paresthesias and dizziness.  She presented to her PCP the next
day; the burning completely resolved following his reassurance.
.
For one week thereafter, her only symptom was the dizziness.  
She
followed up with her PCP again, and was reassured.  She was then
symptom-free for two-weeks, the timing of which corresponded 
with
vacation.
.
Thereafter, the dizziness returned.  It became associated with a
pressure across the eyes. The sensation was somewhat relieved by
sudafed.
.
In ___, she developed facial paresthesias again.  Now the
abnormal sensations involved the cheek and chin L>R.  On ___,
she flew to ___ for vacation.  Her face felt tingly and
""inflamed"" during the flight.  However, throughout the vacation,
she actually felt much better with almost complete resolution of
all symptoms.  The facial symptoms returned on the flight home.
.
On ___, she returned to her PCP.  He suggested the sinus
infection had returned.  He presecribed erythromycin and
prednisone 40 mg x 4 days.  However, she became worried that the
therapies were not helping - and that the sinus infection could
not account for all the symptoms.  That night she developed
burning that encompassed the entire back.  It lasted all night. 
She identifies stress as a precipitant.  During a visit to a 
lake
the next day, the symptom completely resolved.
.
On ___, she developed a sense of sunburn on her back.  Her
forearms, L>R began to feel ""funny,"" as did the medial aspect of
her right lower leg.  It spontaneously resolved the next day.  
.
On ___, both arms started to feel as if they were burning. 

The burning progressed over the next day to encompass the neck
and entire torso (back and front) to the level of the waist.  
She
further desccribes it as a sense that she is being cut by 
razors.
The pain rates ___ at worst.  It has been constant with waxing
and waning intensity.  It changes location.  At night it is most
pronounced in an escutcheon pattern from the chest to the
epigastrium; this pain is worse with lying down and better with
standing and moving around.  
.
She has never had any similar symptoms (or ophtho symptoms) in
the past.  To address the symptoms, she has tried pepcid,
benadryl, and had her IUD removed.  Ibuprofen 800 mg has 
provided
some relief.
.
She met with neurologist Dr. ___ on ___ who
coordinated an MRI of the brain and spinal cord to evaluate for
inflammatory, structural, and demyelinating processes.  The MRI
of the brain showed no definite focal lesions to suggest a
demyelinating etiology.  The MRI of the cervical spine showed
reversal of cervical lordosis and multilevel degenerative
disease, most pronounced from C4-6.  Dr. ___
referred her for an allergy evaluation ___ it was thought
she could be be suffering from chronic sinusitis or allergic
rhinitis in addition to a neurologic process. Given an 
escalation
in symptoms, it was recommended she be admitted to the neurolgy
service for an expedited evaluation.  She is most concerned by
the degree of discomfort and the possibility of multiple
sclerosis.

process. All investigations are this far unremarkable. ? 
non-organic cause for symptoms vs acephalgic migraine/GERD 
contributing.
.
# Neuro: Patient was admitted for assessment of paresthesias and 
all over intermittent body pains. Patient had considerable 
concerns regarding MS was also able to reproduce symptoms with 
hyprventilation. MRI brain and spine were essentially 
unremarkable. LP showed 1RBC and 1 WBC with normal Pr and Glc. 
Lyme PCR and OCBs pending at time of writing. TSH was normal and 
RAST and IgE pending at time of writing. TSH, ESR and CRP were 
normal. There is no current evidence of MS. ___, there are so 
far no signs on exam, imaging, or CSF studies to suggest a focal 
structural nervous system lesion or 
infectious/inflammatory/demyelinating condition that could 
explain her symptoms.  There is a more prominent disc bulge at 
C5-C6 which indents the ventral surface of the cord, but this 
cannot account for her symptoms. Patient was given a soft 
cervical collar for this. Patient did note once-yearly migraine 
headaches, and some of her symptoms may be related to acephalgic 
migraine. Some of her upper torso symptoms sound most related to 
GERD and not neurological. In the meantime, trial of 
prophylactic migraine treatment with nortriptylline was started 
to see if this improves her symptoms. GERD therapy was was 
changed from famotidine to pantoprazole. Patient will follow-up 
with neurology.

The following week she began to have frequent headaches. She
describes a throbbing discomfort in the bifrontal region that
radiated back to the occipital region. The headaches rated
___ in intensity. There was no clear trigger. There were no
exacerbating factors. The discomfort was associated with
""pressure"" across the eyes and forehead. There was no
concomitant nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, photophobia, or
sensorimotor disturbance. Aspirin and tylenol provided relief.
.
Around the same time, she began to develop dizziness. She
characterizes the sensation as ""the early buzz with a glass of
wine"" or the feeling one has while getting off a boat. She
found
that when she quickly turned her head, it felt as though it took
a moment for her eyes to catch up and adjust. There was no
clear
trigger for the sensation such as moving from a stand to a sit,
although the sensation did tend to occur more frequently when
she
was in the upright position and moving about. There were no
exacerbating factors, alleviating variable, or associated
symptoms. It could last all day.
.
For these symptoms, she presented to her PCP who attributed the
symptoms to a sinus infection. She was prescribed a course of
amoxicillin. The headache resolved within 24 hours. However,
because the dizziness did not resolve, she returned to the PCP.
He prescribed a four-day course of prednisone 40 mg per day.
.
By early ___, she developed a tingling that predominently
affected the left cheek. She presented to an ED where a
non-contrast CT of the head was done. It was reportedly
negative
except for ""fluid in the nasal cavity."" She googled her
symptoms, however, and found that multiple sclerosis could be an
explanation. She says she became panicked at the thought. That
night, she developed ""burning"" in a band across the back between
the two shoulders. It did not radiate. There were no
exacerbating factors or associated symptoms other than the
facial
paresthesias and dizziness. She presented to her PCP the next
day; the burning completely resolved following his reassurance.
.
For one week thereafter, her only symptom was the dizziness.
She
followed up with her PCP again, and was reassured. She was then
symptom-free for two-weeks, the timing of which corresponded
with
vacation.
.
Thereafter, the dizziness returned. It became associated with a
pressure across the eyes. The sensation was somewhat relieved by
sudafed.
.
In ___, she developed facial paresthesias again. Now the
abnormal sensations involved the cheek and chin L>R. On ___,
she flew to ___ for vacation. Her face felt tingly and
""inflamed"" during the flight. However, throughout the vacation,
she actually felt much better with almost complete resolution of
all symptoms. The facial symptoms returned on the flight home.
.
On ___, she returned to her PCP. He suggested the sinus
infection had returned. He presecribed erythromycin and
prednisone 40 mg x 4 days. However, she became worried that the
therapies were not helping - and that the sinus infection could
not account for all the symptoms. That night she developed
burning that encompassed the entire back. It lasted all night.
She identifies stress as a precipitant. During a visit to a
lake
the next day, the symptom completely resolved.
.
On ___, she developed a sense of sunburn on her back. Her
forearms, L>R began to feel ""funny,"" as did the medial aspect of
her right lower leg. It spontaneously resolved the next day.
.
On ___, both arms started to feel as if they were burning.
The burning progressed over the next day to encompass the neck
and entire torso (back and front) to the level of the waist.
She
further desccribes it as a sense that she is being cut by
razors.
The pain rates ___ at worst. It has been constant with waxing
and waning intensity. It changes location. At night it is most
pronounced in an escutcheon pattern from the chest to the
epigastrium; this pain is worse with lying down and better with
standing and moving around.
.
She has never had any similar symptoms (or ophtho symptoms) in
the past. To address the symptoms, she has tried pepcid,
benadryl, and had her IUD removed. Ibuprofen 800 mg has
provided
some relief.
.
She met with neurologist Dr. ___ on ___ who
coordinated an MRI of the brain and spinal cord to evaluate for
inflammatory, structural, and demyelinating processes. The MRI
of the brain showed no definite focal lesions to suggest a
demyelinating etiology. The MRI of the cervical spine showed
reversal of cervical lordosis and multilevel degenerative
disease, most pronounced from C4-6. Dr. ___
referred her for an allergy evaluation ___ it was thought
she could be be suffering from chronic sinusitis or allergic
rhinitis in addition to a neurologic process. Given an
escalation
in symptoms, it was recommended she be admitted to the neurolgy
service for an expedited evaluation. She is most concerned by
the degree of discomfort and the possibility of multiple
sclerosis.

hyprventilation. MRI brain and spine were essentially
unremarkable. LP showed 1RBC and 1 WBC with normal Pr and Glc.
Lyme PCR and OCBs pending at time of writing. TSH was normal and
RAST and IgE pending at time of writing. TSH, ESR and CRP were
normal. There is no current evidence of MS. ___, there are so
far no signs on exam, imaging, or CSF studies to suggest a focal
structural nervous system lesion or
infectious/inflammatory/demyelinating condition that could
explain her symptoms. There is a more prominent disc bulge at
C5-C6 which indents the ventral surface of the cord, but this
cannot account for her symptoms. Patient was given a soft
cervical collar for this. Patient did note once-yearly migraine
headaches, and some of her symptoms may be related to acephalgic
migraine. Some of her upper torso symptoms sound most related to
GERD and not neurological. In the meantime, trial of
prophylactic migraine treatment with nortriptylline was started
to see if this improves her symptoms. GERD therapy was was
changed from famotidine to pantoprazole. Patient will follow-up
with neurology.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a ___ with a recent history of L kidney infarction and 
significant L renal artery thrombosis who presented to the ED 
with hematuria and flank pain as a transfer from OSH.

The patient initially presented on ___ at OSH with left flank 
pain and was subsequently found to have a left kidney 
infarction, and started on Lovenox bridge to Coumadin 2.5 mg 
qday.  At the time, echocardiography did not demonstrate a 
thromboembolic source. Patient has had several workups in the 
past for palpitations, but there was also no diagnosis of atrial 
fibrillation or atrial flutter on both 15- and 30-day Holter 
monitors.  

She represented to ___ on ___ with frank painless hematuria 
and subjective fever (only on day of readmission), and at that 
time, the patient was admitted for acute management of left 
renal artery thrombosis, and underwent thrombectomy and stent 
placement.  The patient was discharged, but presented again 12 
hrs later with left flank pain, increased abdominal pain, 
inability to void, and passing only clots. Patient received a 
3-way bladder irrigation which lavaged a considerable number of 
clots prior to transfer to ___.  She was also started on 
Levaquin for concern that the patient might have a comcomitant 
cystitis due to the frank blood or a urinary tract infection.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ with a recent left kidney infarction ___ left 
renal artery thrombosis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR 
who presented for management of continued hematuria and flank 
pain.
. 
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hematuria. Patient's most likely ___ recent left renal infarct 
as well as her recent supratherapeutic INR (4.6 at admission). 
Patient's Hct was down 6 points from recent discharge from 
___, but stable at 31 during this hospitalization. 
Patient's continued hematuria thought to be degradation of clots 
in her renal pelvis and not any active bleeding.  The patient's 
Coumadin was held at admission, and the patient was placed on a 
heparin drip when her INR <3. The patient was transitioned to 
Lovenox 80 mg BID at discharge. 
.  
# Recurrent arterial thrombosis. It was unclear if the patient's 
thromboses developed while on anticoagulation or if the 
thromboses were not well imaged at her first presentation. 
Patient may have been hypercoagulable while being bridged from 
Lovenox to Coumadin resulting in transient decrease in Prot C 
and S levels, predisposing her to formation of thromboses.  
Despite absence of a family history or prior history of 
clotting, a work-up for hypercoagulability was initiated. 
Follow-up has been scheduled with the ___ at 
___. 
.
# Leukocytosis. Patient was admitted with a WBC of 14.7 on 
___.  Given the patient's negative UA and negative urine 
cultures, the leukocytosis was most likely ___ stress 
demargination. Leukocytosis resolved at the time of discharge.
.  
# Bladder spasms. The patient experienced intermittent bladder 
spasms associated with increased bladder pressure and increased 
frequency of urination. Bladde rspasms resolved with Oxybutinin.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
#  Anxiety. Stable. Patient was continued on home Xanax.
.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE:
-Pt will be seen in ___ at ___ on ___.  
Will need follow-up in 6 months for comprehensive 
hypercoagulability work-up.

___.  You were admitted with blood in your urine.  
This is a result of the recent blood clot you had in your 
kidney.  

You were evaluated by urology specialists.  An ultrasound showed 
that you had no more bloody clots in your bladder and normal 
blood flow in your left renal artery and vein. 

The blood in your urine decreased.  However, we expect that the 
blood in your urine will likely continue for at least the next 
two weeks.  The most important thing is that your blood levels 
have remained stable.

We recommend that you follow-up with your primary care physician 
(see appointment below) to have your blood levels checked within 
the next week.  We are also working on having an appointment 
scheduled with a urologist (see below) in case your bleeding 
should continue past two weeks.  

Thank you for letting us participate in your care.  Best wishes 
in your recovery.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a ___ with a recent history of L kidney infarction and
significant L renal artery thrombosis who presented to the ED
with hematuria and flank pain as a transfer from OSH.
The patient initially presented on ___ at OSH with left flank
pain and was subsequently found to have a left kidney
infarction, and started on Lovenox bridge to Coumadin 2.5 mg
qday. At the time, echocardiography did not demonstrate a
thromboembolic source. Patient has had several workups in the
past for palpitations, but there was also no diagnosis of atrial
fibrillation or atrial flutter on both 15- and 30-day Holter
monitors.
She represented to ___ on ___ with frank painless hematuria
and subjective fever (only on day of readmission), and at that
time, the patient was admitted for acute management of left
renal artery thrombosis, and underwent thrombectomy and stent
placement. The patient was discharged, but presented again 12
hrs later with left flank pain, increased abdominal pain,
inability to void, and passing only clots. Patient received a
3-way bladder irrigation which lavaged a considerable number of
clots prior to transfer to ___. She was also started on

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ with a recent left kidney infarction ___ left
renal artery thrombosis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR
who presented for management of continued hematuria and flank
pain.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hematuria. Patient's most likely ___ recent left renal infarct
as well as her recent supratherapeutic INR (4.6 at admission).
Patient's Hct was down 6 points from recent discharge from
___, but stable at 31 during this hospitalization.
Patient's continued hematuria thought to be degradation of clots
in her renal pelvis and not any active bleeding. The patient's
Coumadin was held at admission, and the patient was placed on a
heparin drip when her INR <3. The patient was transitioned to
Lovenox 80 mg BID at discharge.
.
# Recurrent arterial thrombosis. It was unclear if the patient's
thromboses developed while on anticoagulation or if the
thromboses were not well imaged at her first presentation.
Patient may have been hypercoagulable while being bridged from
Lovenox to Coumadin resulting in transient decrease in Prot C
and S levels, predisposing her to formation of thromboses.
Despite absence of a family history or prior history of
clotting, a work-up for hypercoagulability was initiated.
Follow-up has been scheduled with the ___ at
___.
.
# Leukocytosis. Patient was admitted with a WBC of 14.7 on
___. Given the patient's negative UA and negative urine
cultures, the leukocytosis was most likely ___ stress
demargination. Leukocytosis resolved at the time of discharge.
.
# Bladder spasms. The patient experienced intermittent bladder
spasms associated with increased bladder pressure and increased
frequency of urination. Bladde rspasms resolved with Oxybutinin.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
# Anxiety. Stable. Patient was continued on home Xanax.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had knee pain and 
swelling. You were presumed to have non-septic pre-patellar 
bursitis, in which a small sac of fluid in front of the kneecap 
becomes irritated. You completed the steroids 
(methylprednisolone) that your Primary Care Physician gave you. 
We have given you Tylenol and naproxen to take at home as 
needed. You can continue with ice packs, compression, and 
elevation of the leg.

In addition, we noted you had elevated blood sugars when you 
came in. We checked your hemoglobin A1c level, which is an 
indicator of blood sugars over 3 months, and it was elevated, at 
12.7%. We changed your diabetes drugs by continuing you on your 
home metformin (1000 mg twice a day), increasing your dose of 
glyburide (to 10 mg twice a day), but also by starting you on 
insulin Lantus (15 units at bedtime). You should continue to use 
these medications at home as directed by the diabetes doctor and 
nurse you met in the hospital.

We offer some recommendations on using insulin:
 Take your insulin consistently.
 Always check the appearance of your insulin before using it. 
Do not use it if it looks different than it usually does (if 
there are clumps in it, or if it looks cloudy when it should be 
clear).
 Keep your insulin in a cool, dry place (refrigerator, not 
freezer); keep away from direct light.
 Inject each insulin dose in a different spot (at least two 
inches away from the site of the last dose).
 If you have any questions or concerns about your insulin, call 
your healthcare provider.
 Never skip your insulin unless instructed by your healthcare 
provider.
 When travelling, keep insulin with you in a carry-on bag.

We offer some recommendations about checking your glucose 
levels:
 Check your blood sugar every morning before you eat.
 Bring your glucose meter to your Primary Care and Diabetes 
doctors' appointments.
 Please call your doctor if you have a blood sugar greater than 
300 for more than 4 hours.
 Blood sugar less than 70 is too low for most people with 
diabetes; call your doctor if you have a low blood sugar.
 With low blood sugar you may feel: shaky, sweaty, weak; 
irritable, anxious; very hungry; numbness or tingling around 
your lips; confused or having a sudden mood change.
 When you feel that your blood sugar may be low, you should 
check your blood sugar with your meter; if you cant check your 
blood
sugar right away, treat yourself as if the blood sugar is low.
 If you have a blood sugar reading below 70, or if you think 
your blood sugar is low but cant check it, you should eat 15 
grams of carbohydrates immediately. For example: 3 glucose 
tablets, half a cup of fruit juice or non-diet soda.
 It takes about 15 minutes to start to feel better. Rest for 15 
minutes. After 15 minutes, if you do not feel better and your 
blood sugar is still not over 70, treat it again with the same 
amount of food.
 Always carry with you lifesavers or glucose tablets to treat a 
low blood sugar.

It is very important for you to follow up at the ___ on 
___. High blood sugar levels may lead to other health 
problems and can be prevented with good diabetes management.

It was a pleasure to take care of you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital because you had knee pain and
swelling. You were presumed to have non-septic pre-patellar
bursitis, in which a small sac of fluid in front of the kneecap
becomes irritated. You completed the steroids
(methylprednisolone) that your Primary Care Physician gave you.
We have given you Tylenol and naproxen to take at home as
needed. You can continue with ice packs, compression, and
elevation of the leg.
In addition, we noted you had elevated blood sugars when you
came in. We checked your hemoglobin A1c level, which is an
indicator of blood sugars over 3 months, and it was elevated, at
12.7%. We changed your diabetes drugs by continuing you on your
home metformin (1000 mg twice a day), increasing your dose of
glyburide (to 10 mg twice a day), but also by starting you on
insulin Lantus (15 units at bedtime). You should continue to use
these medications at home as directed by the diabetes doctor and
nurse you met in the hospital.
We offer some recommendations on using insulin:
 Take your insulin consistently.
 Always check the appearance of your insulin before using it.
Do not use it if it looks different than it usually does (if
there are clumps in it, or if it looks cloudy when it should be
clear).
 Keep your insulin in a cool, dry place (refrigerator, not
freezer); keep away from direct light.
 Inject each insulin dose in a different spot (at least two
inches away from the site of the last dose).
 If you have any questions or concerns about your insulin, call
your healthcare provider.
 Never skip your insulin unless instructed by your healthcare
provider.
 When travelling, keep insulin with you in a carry-on bag.
We offer some recommendations about checking your glucose
levels:
 Check your blood sugar every morning before you eat.
 Bring your glucose meter to your Primary Care and Diabetes
doctors' appointments.
 Please call your doctor if you have a blood sugar greater than
300 for more than 4 hours.
 Blood sugar less than 70 is too low for most people with
diabetes; call your doctor if you have a low blood sugar.
 With low blood sugar you may feel: shaky, sweaty, weak;
irritable, anxious; very hungry; numbness or tingling around
your lips; confused or having a sudden mood change.
 When you feel that your blood sugar may be low, you should
check your blood sugar with your meter; if you cant check your
blood
sugar right away, treat yourself as if the blood sugar is low.
 If you have a blood sugar reading below 70, or if you think
your blood sugar is low but cant check it, you should eat 15
grams of carbohydrates immediately. For example: 3 glucose
tablets, half a cup of fruit juice or non-diet soda.
 It takes about 15 minutes to start to feel better. Rest for 15
minutes. After 15 minutes, if you do not feel better and your
blood sugar is still not over 70, treat it again with the same
amount of food.
 Always carry with you lifesavers or glucose tablets to treat a
low blood sugar.
It is very important for you to follow up at the ___ on
___. High blood sugar levels may lead to other health
problems and can be prevented with good diabetes management.
It was a pleasure to take care of you.
Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

History of Present Illness:
Patient reports that he has been feeling depressed for several 
months.  This is in the context of several stressors: his 
ongoing divorce from his wife (which he
initiated), his separation from his 4 children who live with his 
wife), ___ stressors, unhappiness at work, and his concerns 
that his perceived memory loss is actually developing 
Alzheimer's disease, which his mother suffered from.  He began 
treatment with a therapist, Dr. ___ in ___, in 
late ___.  This ___, she suggested he see a 
psychiatrist for treatment of his depression, so he saw Dr. 
___ for one appointment, at which he was 
prescribed Wellbutrin 200mg TID.  He felt that the Wellbutrin 
was not treating his anxiety symptoms appropriately enough 
described below), so he increased the dose on his own, to 
800mg/day and then 1200mg/day, all with only minor relief.

Patient reports that today at work, where he assists in managing 
an ice-skating rink, he began crying at his desk.  He had been 
feeling ""spacey,"" feeling like the sounds of peoples' voices 
were going over his head, and detached.  He also felt ""tipsy"" 
and ""clumsy,"" and ""panicked.""  He called his PCP (Dr. ___ 
___ ask what the maximum dose of Wellbutrin daily was, 
and he left a message.  He had called his psychiatrist 3 days 
previously to ask for an urgent appointment, but was unable to 
reach her. Today, he called a list of several ___ 
psychiatrists to schedule an urgent appointment, but was unable 
to reach anybody.

The patient reports feeling ""sad,"" poor sleep with early morning 
wakening, good appetite, normal energy level, and appropriate 
level of interest in every day activities.  He denies 
hopelessness.  He denies SI at this time, but reports that years 
ago (he doesn't remember when), he had thoughts of SI but no 
plan, and he denies any past attempts.  He says that he lives 
with and takes care of an elderly man ___ years old).  He says 
that he has no social supports. Towards the end of the 
interview, he told me ""I feel lost...I'm scared,"" and then he
suddenly became tearful and requested a minute to gather 
himself. He stated that he did not want inpatient treatment, but 
was amenable to a PHP.

After I arranged an intake appointment at ___, I 
returned to speak with the patient.  At this time, the patient 
reported to me that he has been having thoughts of suicide, for 
an uncertain length of time.  He endorsed plan of crashing his 
car, but would make certain that he did not hurt or kill 
anybody.  He says that he did not bring this up before or with 
his psychiatrist or therapist because he did not want the 
attention or to be admitted to the hospital.  He is concerned 
about his job, and how he will be perceived at work.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Legal: ___
2. Medical: The patient had no medical issues while on Deac-4.

3. Psychiatric: On admission, the patient's wellbutrin was 
discontinued.  After a one day holiday, he was started on celexa 
10mg daily, and was offered seroquel 50mg PRNs for 
agitation/anxiety.  His therapist (Dr. ___ and 
psychiatrist (Dr. ___ were contacted, both of whom 
expressed significant concern regarding the patient's safety.  
They discussed his past endorsements of SI and brief HI directed 
at his wife, of his loneliness, and of their belief that he was 
""extremely high risk"" to suicide.  He acknowledged this concern, 
and was agreeable to continued hospital stay.  His celexa was 
increased to 20mg daily and then to 40mg daily.  During one of 
his episodes of heightened anxiety, the patient took seroquel 
PRN and reported that it provided significant, though not 
complete, relief of his symptoms.  He also used seroquel 125 mg 
qhs for sleep with good result.

4. Psychosocial: While in the ___, the patient initially 
expressed frustration and disagreement with his involuntary 
admission.  However, he signed a CV on admission and throughout 
his stay on Deac-4, he was agreeable to continuing his hospital 
stay.  He expressed anger at the SW for confronting him about 
his smile, which seemed incongruent with his reported mood.  He 
underwent psychological testing (a ___ with Dr. ___ and 
did not test as abnormal.  When presented with the results of 
the ___ test, the patient was unhappy that the results 
demonstrated no significant symptoms.  He said that he felt he 
was ""sicker than the test showed,"" and that he would like to 
retake it.  He said that he does not want to be discharged and 
would like to stay inpatient longer.  Per Dr. ___ 
patient was ""angry"" with him towards the end of the interview.  
On ___, Mr. ___ met with the team and acknowledged that 
prolonging his stay would not likely be helpful to him and that 
he needed to get back out in the world and confront his 
problems.  He was willing to accept follow-up treatment in a 
partial hospital program as a transition from the inpatient 
setting.  

Attending Addendum
During all his stay here we did not find any evidence to suggest 
clear cut, acute imminent suicidality or homicidality, but 
nevertheless he will always remain somewhat of a risk for acute 
depression. We have started him on Celexa and hope that he 
continues it. An after care plan was set up with his 
participation and it is hoped that he will make use of it. There 
was also some evidence that long hospital stays for him could 
actually prolong his return to better functioning by fostering 
regression. He was noticed as becoming dependant on being in the 
hospital and himself felt the same.

History of Present Illness:
This is an ___ y.o. female without much past medical history who
presents as a code-STEMI. At about 10:00 am this morning she
was sitting down in a chair when she had sudden tight feeling
back pain. She describees this pain as being in the middle of
her back between her shoulder blades and radiating in between
them. There was no radiation to the neck or left arm. She
denies any frank dyspnea thought reports she was breathing
""shallowly."" She also reports profuse diaphoresis and some
nausea though she did not vomit. She called a friend who urged
her to call EMS, which she did. They arrived and field EKG's
showed ST depressions in the precordial leads consistent with
posterior STEMI. Thus, she was brought straight to ___ for
intervention. Of note she did receive NTG in the field with
minimal improvement in her symptoms.
.
In the ED initial vitals were HR 69, BP 157/80, RR 21, O2 Sat
99% on RA. She was continuing to have back pain of ___. After
receiving heparin, ASA, and BB she was taken to the cath lab and
received BMS to a totally occluded LCx. During the
catheterization she did have chest pain briefly but this
resolved and she was pain free after the procedure. Post
procedure EKG's showed resolution of her ST depressions in the
precordial leads.
.
On arrival to the floor she is breathing comfortably on 2 L by
NC. She denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.
.
Cardiac Review of systems is notable for two pillow orthopnea
that has been going on for years. She denies PND. No syncope
or presyncope. She has had significant lower extremity edema
with skin changes for years. This does not appear to be
worsening recently. The patient does not have dyspnea on
exertion but ambulates minimally between the four rooms of her
apartment at baseline. She has been housebound for some time.

TTE ___
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is very 
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall (see schematic) and 
preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. 
Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 57 %. 
Left ventricular cardiac index is depressed (less than 2.0 
L/min/m2). There is
no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic 
sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The tricuspid
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] 
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with very mild regional systolic 
dysfunction most consistent with single vessel coronary artery 
disease (PDA
distribution). Normal function of visualized anterior and 
lateral walls.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , 
mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now seen.
.
TEE ___
Conclusions   
Pre-CPB:
 The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. 

 The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic 
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the 
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is 
seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 


 The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial 
mitral regurgitation. 
 Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results at time 
of study. 

 Post-CPB:
 Biventricular systolic function is preserved. The LVEF is 
50-55%. The calculated cardiac output by continuity equation is 
4.5Lmin. 

 The MR remains trace. Other valvular function remains 
unchanged. There is no evidence of aortic dissection 
.

___ Xray @ ___: 
FINDINGS: The heart is not enlarged.
The lungs are clear bilaterally with normal pulmonary vascular
distribution. There is no pleural fluid.
IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary disease. 

___: Abdominal US ___: Impression:
No significant abnormality seen in the abdominal aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ underwent typical preoperative testing and was brought 
to the Operating Room on ___ where the patient underwent 
Coronary artery bypass grafting x ___, Maze, 
Ligation of Left atrial appendage.  Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  On 
POD 2, he had EKG changes and TTE was checked showing mild basal 
inferior wall hypokinesis, but he remained hemodynamically 
stable.  He was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  He resumed his home Pradaxa for Afib 
after wires were removed.  He was evaluated by the Physical 
Therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By 
the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating 
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in good 
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

TTE ___
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is very
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall (see schematic) and
preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments.
Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 57 %.
Left ventricular cardiac index is depressed (less than 2.0
L/min/m2). There is
no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic
sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta
diameter for
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+]
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with very mild regional systolic
dysfunction most consistent with single vessel coronary artery
disease (PDA
distribution). Normal function of visualized anterior and
lateral walls.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ ,
mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now seen.
.
TEE ___
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results at time
of study. Post-CPB:
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. The LVEF is
50-55%. The calculated cardiac output by continuity equation is
4.5Lmin. The MR remains trace. Other valvular function remains
unchanged. There is no evidence of aortic dissection
.
___ Xray @ ___:
FINDINGS: The heart is not enlarged.
The lungs are clear bilaterally with normal pulmonary vascular
distribution. There is no pleural fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
The morning after presentation, Ms. ___ reported attenuated 
numbness of tingling of the left arm and face. She had extensive 
give-way weakness of the
left arm which was greatly attenuated with contralateral
distraction. The face was symmetric and the leg strong. Both
basic and cortical sensory tests of the left side were normal.

Ms. ___ laboratory work-up including the following: Her CBC 
and BMP were normal. Her LFTs were normal. Her trop was normal. 
Her A1c was 5.1, and her lipid panel was pending at the time of 
discharge. TSHw as 4.1. Serum tox panel was neg. 

Her EKG revealed sinus bradycardia unchanged from ___. 
Her CT head and her MRI/A head and neck and MRV head did not 
demonstrate any acute intracranial process. The final reads on 
the CT and MRI were pending at the time of discharge.

Her presentationw was determined to be due to musculoskeletal 
issues related to postural changes during breastfeeding. 
Demyelinating disease could not be ruled out. Given her history 
of migraine, a complex migraine was on the differential but 
would be unlikely to produce a sustained left-sided deficit and 
with persistent symptoms after headache resolution. It is also 
possible that she was elaborating on resolved symptoms of 
complex migraine so that she could be taken seriously. Seizure 
unlikely to produced sustained symptoms. Stroke/TIA were thought 
to be unlikely.

Given the absence of neurological exam abnormalities, she was 
discharged home with plan for outpatient cervical spine MRI to 
evaluate for demyelination.

Transitional issues:
1. ___ need direct visualization of adenoids
2. Lipid panel
3. Final read on MRI describes nonspecific left frontoparietal 
white matter lesions; has follow-up in neurology clinic and will 
require further work-up to rule out demyelinating disease
4. Will need outpatient MRI cervical spine with and without 
contrast to evaluate for demyelinating lesions

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for evaluation of your 3 days of left sided 
weakness and tingling. Your examination and imaging did not 
reveal any evidence of stroke or inflammation, which is 
reassuring. You will need to continue the work-up once you leave 
the hospital. We have ordered an MRI of your cervical (upper) 
spine to see if this might contribute to your weakness. It's 
also possible that your neck pain and numbness may be due to 
breastfeeding and holding your newborn. You should make sure to 
take breaks, as needed, and also switch arms when holding the 
baby if one arm feels tired. 

Please follow up as scheduled below and call or come back in if 
you have any new/worsening symptoms.

It was a pleasure meeting you!

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ yo female who presented with sub-acute course of 
fevers, dyspnea, dry cough, and malaise.  
.  
#Community-acquired pneumonia - Cough and fatigue, leukocytosis, 
and chest xray findings suggested pneumonia.  Patient has some 
risk for resistent bacteria given that she works at a rehab 
facility but she has no other risk factors so will require 
treatment only for CAP.  The patient had a CTA chest performed 
to rule out thromboembolic disease.  No venous thromboembolism 
was noted, but it did show a left lower lobe pneumonia with an 
initial read of possible empyema.  Further radiologic review 
suggested this was not the case, but the patient remained 
hospitalized for two nights for monitoring.  She did have a 
moderate amount of pleuritic and musculoskeletal pain that was 
managed with scheduled tylenol.  Cough suppressants were given 
with good effect.  The patient slowly improved clinically, 
leukocytosis resolved, and the patient was discharged two days 
after admission.  She was initially treated with levofloxacin 
during her course, but her insurance does not cover this 
antibiotic, so she was discharged with a 7 day course of 
azithromycin and cefpodoxime.  She will likely need follow up 
imaging to ensure clearance and if still positive or poor 
response to treatment may need repeat CT to ensure no empyema.
She was maintained on influenza precautions, as the results of 
her nasal swab were pending throughout her course.  She will 
wear a mask at home while symptomatic until instructed 
otherwise.
.  
#. Pleuritic chest pain- PE already ruled out as above, unlikely 
cardiac given negative enzymes and EKG and most likely her PNA 
is causing pleurisy.  
.  
#. HTN: Atenolol was continued, patient was normotensive.  
.  
#. Anemia/Fatigue: This seems to be a chronic problem for her 
likely exacerbated by her new infection.  Anemia work up did not 
reveal overt iron-deficiency anemia.  Guaiac was negative.  TSH 
mildly elevated at 4.5.  Patient will discuss further evaluation 
with her PCP.  It was thought that atenolol, which was recently 
started, may have been contributory.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ yo female who presented with sub-acute course of
fevers, dyspnea, dry cough, and malaise.
.
#Community-acquired pneumonia - Cough and fatigue, leukocytosis,
and chest xray findings suggested pneumonia. Patient has some
risk for resistent bacteria given that she works at a rehab
facility but she has no other risk factors so will require
treatment only for CAP. The patient had a CTA chest performed
to rule out thromboembolic disease. No venous thromboembolism
was noted, but it did show a left lower lobe pneumonia with an
initial read of possible empyema. Further radiologic review
suggested this was not the case, but the patient remained
hospitalized for two nights for monitoring. She did have a
moderate amount of pleuritic and musculoskeletal pain that was
managed with scheduled tylenol. Cough suppressants were given
with good effect. The patient slowly improved clinically,
leukocytosis resolved, and the patient was discharged two days
after admission. She was initially treated with levofloxacin
during her course, but her insurance does not cover this
antibiotic, so she was discharged with a 7 day course of
azithromycin and cefpodoxime. She will likely need follow up
imaging to ensure clearance and if still positive or poor
response to treatment may need repeat CT to ensure no empyema.
She was maintained on influenza precautions, as the results of
her nasal swab were pending throughout her course. She will
wear a mask at home while symptomatic until instructed
otherwise.
.
#. Pleuritic chest pain- PE already ruled out as above, unlikely
cardiac given negative enzymes and EKG and most likely her PNA
is causing pleurisy.
.
#. HTN: Atenolol was continued, patient was normotensive.
.
#. Anemia/Fatigue: This seems to be a chronic problem for her
likely exacerbated by her new infection. Anemia work up did not
reveal overt iron-deficiency anemia. Guaiac was negative. TSH
mildly elevated at 4.5. Patient will discuss further evaluation
with her PCP. It was thought that atenolol, which was recently
started, may have been contributory.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with strong fam history of 
heart disease who presents with chest pain. He had acute onset 
of chest pain while baking gingerbread last night. The pain went 
across his chest from one shoulder to the other and down his 
left arm, as well as radiating to the back. He was also 
diaphoretic and lightheaded, but had no nausea or vomiting. He 
was not short of breath at the time, but did become short of 
breath at the hospital later on. Pain lasted ___ hours total and 
was constant. He endorses similar chest pain before on exertion, 
but much less severe and self-limited. Patient is mostly 
sedentary, but denies any SOB with activity, no orthopnea/PND, 
no ___ edema.   
.  
He initially presented to an OSH where troponin I was 0.03 and 
CTA was concerning for aortic dissection. He received 1L IVF, 
aspirin 325 mg, nitro paste 1 inch, nitro gtt, and morphine 4 mg 
IV. He was transfered to ___ for further management.  
.  
In the ___ ED, initial VS were: HR 58, BP 116/72, RR 18, 98% 
on 6L NC. Cardiac surgery and radiology reviewed the OSH images

3. Numerous subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, and equivocal 
centrilobular 
ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe raises possibility 
of the 
respiratory bronchiolitis/DIP spectrum of disease related to 
smoking. Followup high-resolution chest CT recommended in 3 - 6 
months. Findings were posted to the ED dashboard, and discussed 
with Dr. ___ at that time. 
.
CARDIAC CATH
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system 
demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA had mild plaquing 
throughout. 
The LAD had a proximal 70% stenosis, a mid vessel 60% stenosis 
and a 
distal vessel 70% stenosis. The Cx was a large vessel with a 
subtotal 
occlusion in the distal portion of the vessel after the takeoff 
of OM2. 
The RCA was a small non-dominant vessel with no angiographically 

apparent disease. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided 
filling 
pressures with an LVEDP of 18 mmHg. The central aortic pressure 
was 134/ 
80 mmHg. There was no transaortic valve gradient on pullback of 
the 
catheter from the LV to the aorta. 
.
TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
fat pad. 
.
CXR (PRE-OP)- no acute abnormalities
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male who presents with acute onset of 
chest pain and EKG/cardiac biomarkers c/w STEMI.  
.  
# Chest pain, STEMI - Patient with multiple cardiac risk 
factors: strong family history, smoking, obesity, and story 
concerning for ACS. Patient had been initially transferred for 
possible aortic dissection based on OSH CTA. However his CTA was 
reviewed by cardiac surgery and radiology and felt not to 
represent dissection. 
EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads. Initial cardiac 
biomarkers were minimally elevated (0.03 at OSH and 0.05 at 
___ ED) so patient was admitted to cards service for cath in 
AM. He received ASA, Plavix, statin, nitro paste paste, 
morphine, IVF and was started on heparin gtt. Chest pain 
resolved and did not recur overnight. Cardiac cath on ___ 
revealed left dominance and distal L Circ subocclusive disease, 
and DES was placed there. There was also diffuse 60-70% LAD 
disease, which was not amenable to PCI. Patient is candidate for 
endoscopic LIMA to LAD, and he was evaluated by cardiac surgery. 
Pre-op evaluation was done (CXR, anesthesia consent) and he will 
follow up with Dr. ___. 
Post-cath EKGs showed improvement of ST elevations and cardiac 
biomarkers began to trend down by ___ AM. Patient was started 
on metoprolol and lisinopril, which should be titrated as 
outpatient. 
Patient was evaluated for risk factors including DM (HbA1c 6.8) 
and hyperlipidemia (chol 226, HDL 25, calcLDL 155, ___ 229). 
Patient will be seen at ___ to evaluate for new diagnosis of 
diabetes. 
.
.  
# Pump - Patient had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart 
failure. TTE showed globally normal function with LVEF 55%, but 
could not rule out focal wall motion abnormality completely 
given suboptimal study. Patient started on ACEi. 
.  
# Rhythm - Patient had 11 beat run NSVT prior to cath, and 9 
beat NSVT at 18:00 ___ which was asymptomatic and occurred 
before beta-blocker had been given. After starting beta-blocker, 
patient had no further events on telemetry for 36 hours.
.  
# Leukocytosis - Likely secondary to STEMI. No evidence of UTI. 
CT chest abnormal, but no definitive PNA and patient afebrile 
and without significant respiratory symptoms. CXR wnl. WBC 
trending down at discharge. 
.  
# Pulmonary nodules, lymphadenopathy - Patient had abnormal 
chest CT with hilar and mediastinal LAD, and multiple pulmonary 
nodules. He will need outpatient follow-up in ___ months with 
repeat high res chest CT.
.
#. Transaminitis: AST elevated c/w muscular release ___ STEMI. 
Trending down at discharge. 
.
Patient was given information to set up new PCP at ___ 
___. He was instructed to set up regular follow up with 
family cardiologist. He will see Dr. ___ will ___ 
cardiac surgery follow-up.

Discharge Instructions:
 
It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted for 
chest pain and were found to have a heart attack. You underwent 
cardiac catherization, which showed an occlusion of one of the 
coronary arteries that supplied blood to your heart muscle. A 
stent was placed to restore blood flow to your heart. Because of 
the stent, you will need to take certain medications daily, and 
follow up with a PCP and cardiologist regularly.
.
Please take the following new medications:
- Aspirin 325 mg daily to protect your heart
- Simvastatin 80 mg daily for cholesterol
- Metoprolol XL 50 mg Take 2 tabs daily to protect your heart 
and lower blood pressure
- Plavix 150 mg daily for two weeks then 75 mg daily to protect 
the stent in your heart

IMAGING:
CXR: No definite acute process.
.
CT C/A/P
1. No evidence of aortic dissection.
2. Significant hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Please
correlate
clinically.
3. Numerous subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, and equivocal
centrilobular
ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe raises possibility
of the
respiratory bronchiolitis/DIP spectrum of disease related to
smoking. Followup high-resolution chest CT recommended in 3 - 6
months. Findings were posted to the ED dashboard, and discussed
with Dr. ___ at that time.
.
CARDIAC CATH
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA had mild plaquing
throughout.
The LAD had a proximal 70% stenosis, a mid vessel 60% stenosis
and a
distal vessel 70% stenosis. The Cx was a large vessel with a
subtotal
occlusion in the distal portion of the vessel after the takeoff
of OM2.
The RCA was a small non-dominant vessel with no angiographically
apparent disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided
filling
pressures with an LVEDP of 18 mmHg. The central aortic pressure
was 134/
80 mmHg. There was no transaortic valve gradient on pullback of
the
catheter from the LV to the aorta.
.
TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
fat pad.
.
CXR (PRE-OP)- no acute abnormalities
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male who presents with acute onset of
chest pain and EKG/cardiac biomarkers c/w STEMI.
.
# Chest pain, STEMI - Patient with multiple cardiac risk
factors: strong family history, smoking, obesity, and story
concerning for ACS. Patient had been initially transferred for
possible aortic dissection based on OSH CTA. However his CTA was
reviewed by cardiac surgery and radiology and felt not to
represent dissection.
EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads. Initial cardiac
biomarkers were minimally elevated (0.03 at OSH and 0.05 at
___ ED) so patient was admitted to cards service for cath in
AM. He received ASA, Plavix, statin, nitro paste paste,
morphine, IVF and was started on heparin gtt. Chest pain
resolved and did not recur overnight. Cardiac cath on ___
revealed left dominance and distal L Circ subocclusive disease,
and DES was placed there. There was also diffuse 60-70% LAD
disease, which was not amenable to PCI. Patient is candidate for
endoscopic LIMA to LAD, and he was evaluated by cardiac surgery.
Pre-op evaluation was done (CXR, anesthesia consent) and he will
follow up with Dr. ___.
Post-cath EKGs showed improvement of ST elevations and cardiac
biomarkers began to trend down by ___ AM. Patient was started
on metoprolol and lisinopril, which should be titrated as
outpatient.
Patient was evaluated for risk factors including DM (HbA1c 6.8)
and hyperlipidemia (chol 226, HDL 25, calcLDL 155, ___ 229).
Patient will be seen at ___ to evaluate for new diagnosis of
diabetes.
.
.
# Pump - Patient had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart
failure. TTE showed globally normal function with LVEF 55%, but
could not rule out focal wall motion abnormality completely
given suboptimal study. Patient started on ACEi.
.
# Rhythm - Patient had 11 beat run NSVT prior to cath, and 9
beat NSVT at 18:00 ___ which was asymptomatic and occurred
before beta-blocker had been given. After starting beta-blocker,
patient had no further events on telemetry for 36 hours.
.
# Leukocytosis - Likely secondary to STEMI. No evidence of UTI.
CT chest abnormal, but no definitive PNA and patient afebrile
and without significant respiratory symptoms. CXR wnl. WBC
trending down at discharge.
.
# Pulmonary nodules, lymphadenopathy - Patient had abnormal
chest CT with hilar and mediastinal LAD, and multiple pulmonary
nodules. He will need outpatient follow-up in ___ months with
repeat high res chest CT.
.
#. Transaminitis: AST elevated c/w muscular release ___ STEMI.
Trending down at discharge.
.
Patient was given information to set up new PCP at ___
___. He was instructed to set up regular follow up with
family cardiologist. He will see Dr. ___ will ___
cardiac surgery follow-up.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted for
chest pain and were found to have a heart attack. You underwent
cardiac catherization, which showed an occlusion of one of the
coronary arteries that supplied blood to your heart muscle. A
stent was placed to restore blood flow to your heart. Because of
the stent, you will need to take certain medications daily, and
follow up with a PCP and cardiologist regularly.
.
Please take the following new medications:
- Aspirin 325 mg daily to protect your heart
- Simvastatin 80 mg daily for cholesterol
- Metoprolol XL 50 mg Take 2 tabs daily to protect your heart
and lower blood pressure

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old employed ___ woman, previously 
diagnosed with mood disorder, anxiety disorder, one prior 
suicide attempt via hanging, who self-reported to ___ with 
complaints of worsening depression and suicidal ideation in the 
setting of recent medication change and numerous ongoing 
psychosocial stressors.
.
Upon interview, the patient endorsed struggling with depression 
and anxiety over the past few months. She clarified that she had 
been on Sertraline for the past 1 to 2 months which did not give 
her significant symptomatic improvement; her outpatient 
psychiatrist started Abilify on ___ and there was 
miscommunication as patient thought she was supposed to 
discontinue the Sertraline and only take the Abilify. Since 
starting Abilify, patient noted increase in frequency of ""manic"" 
episodes, having increased thoughts of wanting to die, and 
episodes of ""dissociating"" during which she feels like she is 
""floating, nothing is real... I don't feel like I'm in my body 
and I feel like I'm in a dream"". Psychiatric review of systems 
was significant for anxiety regarding financial situation and 
panic attacks. Mental status examination upon admission was 
significant for incongruence in affect and mood (reporting 
feeling ""depressed"" and symptoms of depression with euthymic 
affect).
.
Diagnostically, given  the longstanding nature of her depression 
with affective instability, reactive mood with history of self 
injurious behaviors in the past, limited coping skills and 
mental status examination notable for euthymic affect with rapid 
improvement of depressive symptoms in the setting of the 
stabilizing environment of the milieu, I believe her depression 
is most likely consistent with underlying character pathology 
rather than a primary mood disorder. Of note, although she 
carries a diagnosis of BPAD, nothing in my history that is 
concerning for a discrete hypomanic or manic episode. She may 
have met criteria for major depressive disorder in the past, but 
she does not appear depressed on my examination. Of note, she 
likely does meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder 
. 
#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted to Deaconess 4 on a 
___ upon admission, patient signed a Conditional 
Voluntary status which was accepted. Patient denied suicidal 
ideation or thoughts of self-harm, was on 15 minute checks for 
safety, and did not require physical or chemical restraints. 
.
#. Unspecified Mood Disorder
- Since admission, patient has denied suicidal ideation and 
thoughts of self-harm. While she initially endorsed feeling 
depressed, patient reported significant improvement in mood 
while on the unit. She had good participation in her care, 
attending groups regularly. 
- Discontinuation of Abilify was discussed with patient as her 
current symptoms did not indicate psychopharmacologic 
intervention for acute psychosis or mania and she had complaints 
of symptoms of restlessness that resembled akathisia. To treat 
depressed mood, risks and benefits of starting Lexapro 5 mg PO 
QD and Lamictal 25 mg PO QD were discussed and patient agreed to 
start this pharmacologic regimen for the inpatient stay. Upon 
contacting Dr. ___ was clarified that Abilify was meant 
to be added-on as augmentation for treatment of depression; 
however, as patient seemed to have improved mood by inpatient 
day 3, the regimen of Lexapro and Lamictal was continued with 
plans to focus on therapy for stabilization of symptoms as 
outpatient. Lamictal was switched from QD to QHS. 
- Individual, group, and milieu therapy was continuously 
provided during the admission. A family meeting with her husband 
was held prior to discharge to discuss the hospital course; her 
husband was supportive of the patient and plan to discharge with 
outpatient supports with no safety concerns. 
.
#. Anxiety Disorder
- Patient continued to report periods of anxiety symptoms that 
she experiences at her baseline. As patient reported that 
anxiety symptoms at baseline respond well to supportive measures 
and talking about her emotions, she was encouraged to attend CBT 
groups on the unit. She was continued on Ativan 0.5 mg po bid 
prn anxiety 
- Hydroxyzine PO Q6H PRN was initially ordered at 25 mg and 
increased to 50 mg for patient needing to request additional 
Ativan 0.5 mg PO BID PRN for anxiety and sleeping. As patient 
felt that medication was not sufficient for helping her sleep, 
Hydroxyzine was discontinued and Trazodone was started at 25 mg 
PO QHS PRN which was increased to 50 mg with good result. 
.
#. Substance Use: 
- Patient reported history of EtOH binge use behavior in the 
past, currently denying misuse/abuse at this time. Received 
education on risks and benefits of alcohol use, and patient 
stated she would continue to avoid drinking excessive amounts of 
alcohol

QD.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old employed ___ woman, previously
diagnosed with mood disorder, anxiety disorder, one prior
suicide attempt via hanging, who self-reported to ___ with
complaints of worsening depression and suicidal ideation in the
setting of recent medication change and numerous ongoing
psychosocial stressors.
.
Upon interview, the patient endorsed struggling with depression
and anxiety over the past few months. She clarified that she had
been on Sertraline for the past 1 to 2 months which did not give
her significant symptomatic improvement; her outpatient
psychiatrist started Abilify on ___ and there was
miscommunication as patient thought she was supposed to
discontinue the Sertraline and only take the Abilify. Since
starting Abilify, patient noted increase in frequency of ""manic""
episodes, having increased thoughts of wanting to die, and
episodes of ""dissociating"" during which she feels like she is
""floating, nothing is real... I don't feel like I'm in my body
and I feel like I'm in a dream"". Psychiatric review of systems
was significant for anxiety regarding financial situation and
panic attacks. Mental status examination upon admission was
significant for incongruence in affect and mood (reporting
feeling ""depressed"" and symptoms of depression with euthymic
affect).
.
Diagnostically, given the longstanding nature of her depression
with affective instability, reactive mood with history of self
injurious behaviors in the past, limited coping skills and
mental status examination notable for euthymic affect with rapid
improvement of depressive symptoms in the setting of the
stabilizing environment of the milieu, I believe her depression
is most likely consistent with underlying character pathology
rather than a primary mood disorder. Of note, although she
carries a diagnosis of BPAD, nothing in my history that is
concerning for a discrete hypomanic or manic episode. She may
have met criteria for major depressive disorder in the past, but
she does not appear depressed on my examination. Of note, she
likely does meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder
.
#. Legal/Safety: Patient was admitted to Deaconess 4 on a
___ upon admission, patient signed a Conditional
Voluntary status which was accepted. Patient denied suicidal
ideation or thoughts of self-harm, was on 15 minute checks for
safety, and did not require physical or chemical restraints.
.
#. Unspecified Mood Disorder
- Since admission, patient has denied suicidal ideation and
thoughts of self-harm. While she initially endorsed feeling
depressed, patient reported significant improvement in mood
while on the unit. She had good participation in her care,
attending groups regularly.
- Discontinuation of Abilify was discussed with patient as her
current symptoms did not indicate psychopharmacologic
intervention for acute psychosis or mania and she had complaints
of symptoms of restlessness that resembled akathisia. To treat
depressed mood, risks and benefits of starting Lexapro 5 mg PO
QD and Lamictal 25 mg PO QD were discussed and patient agreed to
start this pharmacologic regimen for the inpatient stay. Upon
contacting Dr. ___ was clarified that Abilify was meant
to be added-on as augmentation for treatment of depression;
however, as patient seemed to have improved mood by inpatient
day 3, the regimen of Lexapro and Lamictal was continued with
plans to focus on therapy for stabilization of symptoms as
outpatient. Lamictal was switched from QD to QHS.
- Individual, group, and milieu therapy was continuously
provided during the admission. A family meeting with her husband
was held prior to discharge to discuss the hospital course; her
husband was supportive of the patient and plan to discharge with
outpatient supports with no safety concerns.
.
#. Anxiety Disorder
- Patient continued to report periods of anxiety symptoms that
she experiences at her baseline. As patient reported that
anxiety symptoms at baseline respond well to supportive measures
and talking about her emotions, she was encouraged to attend CBT
groups on the unit. She was continued on Ativan 0.5 mg po bid
prn anxiety
- Hydroxyzine PO Q6H PRN was initially ordered at 25 mg and
increased to 50 mg for patient needing to request additional
Ativan 0.5 mg PO BID PRN for anxiety and sleeping. As patient
felt that medication was not sufficient for helping her sleep,
Hydroxyzine was discontinued and Trazodone was started at 25 mg
PO QHS PRN which was increased to 50 mg with good result.
.
#. Substance Use:
- Patient reported history of EtOH binge use behavior in the
past, currently denying misuse/abuse at this time. Received
education on risks and benefits of alcohol use, and patient
stated she would continue to avoid drinking excessive amounts of
alcohol
.
#. GERD: stable
- Patient was continued on home regimen of Omeprazole 20 mg PO
QD.
.
#. Hypothyroidism: by history, stable
- Patient's TSH was checked upon admission which was within
normal limits (TSH 3.8 on ___. Patient also reported that
she has not been on any medications for her thyroid for a while
as she has been stable. No medications were given for
hypothyroidism during this admission.
.
#. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: with chronic neuropathic pain
- Patient's home regimen of Gabapentin 1200 mg PO BID was
continued.

an ischemic stroke. Upon further history taking on hospital day 
#2, pt reported that he first began to see ""rippling waves"" 
prior to the onset of a HA 20 minutes later. About an hour after 
developing the HA, he experienced word finding difficulty which 
prompted his presentation to the ED. His symptoms resolved after 
~4 hours. At discharge, it was felt that pt likely experienced a 
complex migraine. Still, pt was discharged on his home aspirin 
81mg daily for secondary stroke prevention has he had a history 
of TIAs and migraine with aura. Pt was recommend to use Naproxen 
as needed as an outpatient for a migraine abortive agent.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with a bad headache and global aphasia that 
was concerning for a stroke, so you received a medication called 
tPA. Your MRI did not show a stroke, and some of the other 
symptoms you described were more suggestive of a complex 
migraine. 

If you have another severe headache, please try naproxen 500 mg 
(this is an over the counter medication) as this can abort your 
headache. If you see waves in your vision, this may represent a 
migraine aura and we would recommend you take naproxen at this 
time.

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital, and we 
wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

#2, pt reported that he first began to see ""rippling waves""
prior to the onset of a HA 20 minutes later. About an hour after
developing the HA, he experienced word finding difficulty which
prompted his presentation to the ED. His symptoms resolved after
~4 hours. At discharge, it was felt that pt likely experienced a
complex migraine. Still, pt was discharged on his home aspirin
81mg daily for secondary stroke prevention has he had a history
of TIAs and migraine with aura. Pt was recommend to use Naproxen
as needed as an outpatient for a migraine abortive agent.

frequency object. Able to perform complex commands and repeat.
No apraxia or hemi-neglect observed. Names ___ F words in 1
minute and 14 animals in 1 minute.
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.
Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted with a bad headache and global aphasia that
was concerning for a stroke, so you received a medication called
tPA. Your MRI did not show a stroke, and some of the other
symptoms you described were more suggestive of a complex
migraine.
If you have another severe headache, please try naproxen 500 mg
(this is an over the counter medication) as this can abort your
headache. If you see waves in your vision, this may represent a
migraine aura and we would recommend you take naproxen at this
time.
It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital, and we
wish you the best!
Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

IMAGING/STUDIES
CXR ___- 1. Central bilateral pulmonary opacities are 
consistent with pulmonary edema. 
2. ET tube terminates 7.3 cm above the carina. 

CTA chest ___-  
1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.  However, borderline 
enlargement of the main pulmonary trunk with straightening of 
the interventricular septum is suggestive of some degree of 
right heart strain. 
2. Diffuse airspace consolidation within the dependent portions 
of both lungs may be in keeping with severe multifocal pneumonia 
or diffuse alveolar damage/ARDS. 
3. Complete situs inversus. 

___ ___- 1. Suggestion of subtle diffuse loss of 
gray-white differentiation and slight effacement of the 
quadrigeminal and bilateral ambient cisterns, which may suggest 
diffuse anoxic injury.  If clinically indicated, consider brain 
MRI for further evaluation. 
2. No definite evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 

TTE ___- The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is normal 
left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There 
is normal regional left ventricular systolic function. Global 
left ventricular systolic function is normal. Left ventricular 
cardiac index is low normal (2.0-2.5L/min/m2) No ventricular 
septal defect is seen. There is no resting left ventricular 
outflow tract gradient. Diastolic function could not be assess. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall 
motion. There is abnormal septal motion c/w conduction 
abnormality/paced
rhythm. The aortic sinus diameter is normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. 
There is no mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is mild to moderate [___] tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is moderately elevated. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular wall 
thicknesses, cavity sizes, and regional/global systolic 
function. At least mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Mild to moderate
tricuspid regurgitation.

KUB ___- 1.  Paucity of gas is seen without definitive 
findings of bowel obstruction. 
2.   Delayed nephrogram reflecting renal dysfunction in the 
appropriate 
clinical setting. 

MRI brain ___- Findings are most consistent with a profound 
hypoxic ischemic injury, with diffuse sulcal effacement inferior 
descent of the cerebellar tonsils. 

CXR ___- Persisting parenchymal consolidations in both lungs, 
increased in the left lower lung when compared to prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of HIV, 
dextrocardia and Type 2 DM, who presented after a cardiac 
arrest, course notable for treatment of CAP, no evidence of post 
arrest seizures, overall poor prognosis, transitioned to 
inpatient hospice, died on ___.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#S/P Cardiac arrest
#Anoxic brain injury:
Unclear etiology of arrest though differential includes 
arrhythmia and underlying infection. On admission, the patient 
was unresponsive and without purposeful movement. She underwent 
targeted temperature management and re-warmed with overall poor 
neurologic prognosis and no change in mental status. MRI with 
significant anoxic injury. Initial family meetings yielded a 
change in code status to DNR/OK to intubate. After discussion 
with son decision was made to pursue trach/peg. She was 
reevalated by neurology 1 month post-arrest where it was again 
felt that her neurologic prognosis remained poor. After 
discussion with her son, decision was made to transition to 
DNR/DNI and eventually to hospice care in order to respect her 
overall goals of care. She passed away on ___. PCP was 
notified via telephone re: patient's death.

#Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: 
Intubated following arrest, CT with multifocal consolidations 
however stable O2 requirement. Formerly on CAP treatment 
(ceftriaxone, doxy) early in her hospitalization, now off. 
Notably with irregular breathing pattern. The patient continued 
to have fevers that were felt to be central/neurologic in 
origin. Cultures remained negative. While in the MICU, the 
patient was weaned off mechanical ventilation onto trach mask. 
Transferred to the floor and continued to have intermittent 
tachypnea, but remained stable on trach mask. She was suctioned 
as needed for mucous plugging.

#Skin Breakdown under tracheostomy
Ulceration noted under trach site secondary to microvascular 
ischemic related to trach pressure and tight sutures. She was 
followed by wound care, with daily dressing changes to relieve 
pressure on the wound and keep clean and uninfected.

#Sinus Bradycardia: 
Not on sedation or medications that commonly cause bradycardia. 
EKG showed normal PR interval. Could be an electrical conduction 
problem ie SSS given cardiac arrest but more likely is 
significant neurologic injury. The patient never required 
atropine or pacing.

#Normocytic Anemia: 
Ongoing downtrend during hospitalization. No evidence of 
bleeding, DIC or hemolysis. Retic inappropriately low given 
degree of anemia, likely some degree of suppression. Brown soft 
stools. Felt to be due to polyphlebotomy and critical illness.

#Thrombocytopenia: 
Likely related to critical illness.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
#DMII: A1c 11.7, poorly controlled. The patient was started on 
tube feeds in-house and placed on glargine and a regular insulin 
sliding scale. These were discontinued when the patient was 
transitioned to ___ focused care.

#HIV: On home Descovy and raltegravir. These were discontinued 
when the patient was transitioned to ___ focused care.

IMAGING/STUDIES
CXR ___- 1. Central bilateral pulmonary opacities are
consistent with pulmonary edema.
2. ET tube terminates 7.3 cm above the carina.
CTA chest ___-
1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. However, borderline
enlargement of the main pulmonary trunk with straightening of
the interventricular septum is suggestive of some degree of
right heart strain.
2. Diffuse airspace consolidation within the dependent portions
of both lungs may be in keeping with severe multifocal pneumonia
or diffuse alveolar damage/ARDS.
3. Complete situs inversus.
___ ___- 1. Suggestion of subtle diffuse loss of
gray-white differentiation and slight effacement of the
quadrigeminal and bilateral ambient cisterns, which may suggest
diffuse anoxic injury. If clinically indicated, consider brain
MRI for further evaluation.
2. No definite evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
TTE ___- The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is normal
left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There
is normal regional left ventricular systolic function. Global
left ventricular systolic function is normal. Left ventricular
cardiac index is low normal (2.0-2.5L/min/m2) No ventricular
septal defect is seen. There is no resting left ventricular
outflow tract gradient. Diastolic function could not be assess.
Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall
motion. There is abnormal septal motion c/w conduction
abnormality/paced
rhythm. The aortic sinus diameter is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild to moderate [___] tricuspid
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is moderately elevated. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular wall
thicknesses, cavity sizes, and regional/global systolic
function. At least mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild to moderate
tricuspid regurgitation.
KUB ___- 1. Paucity of gas is seen without definitive
findings of bowel obstruction.
2. Delayed nephrogram reflecting renal dysfunction in the
appropriate
clinical setting.
MRI brain ___- Findings are most consistent with a profound
hypoxic ischemic injury, with diffuse sulcal effacement inferior
descent of the cerebellar tonsils.
CXR ___- Persisting parenchymal consolidations in both lungs,
increased in the left lower lung when compared to prior.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#S/P Cardiac arrest
#Anoxic brain injury:
Unclear etiology of arrest though differential includes
arrhythmia and underlying infection. On admission, the patient
was unresponsive and without purposeful movement. She underwent
targeted temperature management and re-warmed with overall poor
neurologic prognosis and no change in mental status. MRI with
significant anoxic injury. Initial family meetings yielded a
change in code status to DNR/OK to intubate. After discussion
with son decision was made to pursue trach/peg. She was
reevalated by neurology 1 month post-arrest where it was again
felt that her neurologic prognosis remained poor. After
discussion with her son, decision was made to transition to
DNR/DNI and eventually to hospice care in order to respect her
overall goals of care. She passed away on ___. PCP was
notified via telephone re: patient's death.
#Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:
Intubated following arrest, CT with multifocal consolidations
however stable O2 requirement. Formerly on CAP treatment
(ceftriaxone, doxy) early in her hospitalization, now off.
Notably with irregular breathing pattern. The patient continued
to have fevers that were felt to be central/neurologic in
origin. Cultures remained negative. While in the MICU, the
patient was weaned off mechanical ventilation onto trach mask.
Transferred to the floor and continued to have intermittent
tachypnea, but remained stable on trach mask. She was suctioned
as needed for mucous plugging.
#Skin Breakdown under tracheostomy
Ulceration noted under trach site secondary to microvascular
ischemic related to trach pressure and tight sutures. She was
followed by wound care, with daily dressing changes to relieve
pressure on the wound and keep clean and uninfected.
#Sinus Bradycardia:
Not on sedation or medications that commonly cause bradycardia.
EKG showed normal PR interval. Could be an electrical conduction
problem ie SSS given cardiac arrest but more likely is
significant neurologic injury. The patient never required
atropine or pacing.
#Normocytic Anemia:
Ongoing downtrend during hospitalization. No evidence of
bleeding, DIC or hemolysis. Retic inappropriately low given
degree of anemia, likely some degree of suppression. Brown soft
stools. Felt to be due to polyphlebotomy and critical illness.
#Thrombocytopenia:
Likely related to critical illness.
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
#DMII: A1c 11.7, poorly controlled. The patient was started on
tube feeds in-house and placed on glargine and a regular insulin
sliding scale. These were discontinued when the patient was
transitioned to ___ focused care.
#HIV: On home Descovy and raltegravir. These were discontinued
when the patient was transitioned to ___ focused care.

Mrs. ___ is an ___ year old female with history of CAD s/p 
PCI with stent x 2 (unknown date), DM II, HTN and TIA's, 
transferred from ___ after referral from her PCP's 
office for bradycardia and hypotension.  One day prior to 
admission, she was shopping with her daughter and developed 
chest pressure radiating to her back, shortness of breath, and 
sensation of feeling that she was going to pass out.  Pressure 
went away with rest.  She affirms that the pressure across her 
chest is similar to her previous anginal symptoms.  On the 
morning of admission, she developed chest pressure shortly after 
waking and walking around the house and feeling of an irregular 
heart rate.  This was associated with shortness of breath as 
well.  She returned to bed after breakfast and awoke again with 
continued pain.  She took nitroglycerin with some improvement.  
She then went to her PCP's office where she was bradycardic to 
40's with LBBB and hypotensive to 90's.  She recieved SL NTG 
with resolution of symptoms and was sent by ambulance to ED.

in atrial fibrillation.  There is then notation that she 
spontaneously converted to sinus bradycardia within the next ___ 
minutes.  She was given 1L NS and Aspirin 325 mg then 
transferred to ___ for further care. 
.  
In ___ ED, T 98.7  BP 162/57  HR 50  RR 16  O2 sat 98% on 2L.  
She has not had chest pain since her PCP's office.  She had 
repeat lab work drawn and was admitted to cardiology service for 
sinus bradycardia and R/O ACS.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CORONARIES: Admitted with complaint of chest pain and 
shortness of breath.  Chest pain reported as a pressure and 
similar to her previous anginal sympotms.  EKG was unchagned 
from prior, sent from PCP.  Cardiac enzymes were negative during 
admission.  Chest pain resolved during admission.  Due to 
unknown lipids on admission, she was started on high dose statin 
and high dose tylenol.  Metoprolol was held in setting of 
bradycardia.  Plavix and Lisinopril continued.  Patient did 
experience some chest discomfort during admission, but symptoms 
were concurrent with episodes of high anxiety and tearfullness 
that resolved with xanax.

# RHYTHM: Admitted with sinus bradycardia on EKG in ___ ED.  
Nodal blocking agents (toprol, diltiazem and digoxin) were held. 
 Patient was asymptommatic during admission.  Records were 
obtained which indicated history of paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation, not on anticoagulation due to allergy to coumadin 
(cold extremities, tremulousness and somnelance on 2 occasions). 
 Due to concern for ___ syndrome, EP consult recommended 
dual chamber pacemaker placement.  Pacemaker placed on 
___, however RV lead was malfuncitoning on interrogation 
the next day.  The lead was revised on ___.  Patient had 
no further complications from the procedure.  Toprol XL, 
Diltiazem and Digoxin were restarted at previous dose prior to 
discharge.  No anticoagulation was started based on allergy.  
Patient is to ___ in device clinic in 1 week.  At her 
request, she will arrange cardiology ___ on her own closer 
to her home.

# PUMP: No history of systolic or diastolic heart failure per 
records.  EF not depressed on ___ during admission.  Patient 
was not fluid overloaded.  Continued medical management of CAD 
and hypertension.   

# HYPERTENSION - Mrs. ___ was admitted with systolic blood 
pressures > 140 on admission.  Despite bradycardia, she had no 
documented hypotensive episodes during her admisison.  
Lisinopril and Imdur were conitnued.  However, due to 
bradycardia, diltizem and Metoprolol were discontinued during 
admission.  After pacemaker placemaker, Toprol was restarted.  
She should ___ with her PCP after discharge for evaluation 
of her hypertension.  
  
# DYSPNEA - Slight dyspnea on exam, however lung exam was normal 
and oxygen saturation adequate.  Patient had no sign of 
pulmonary edema and was not diuresed.  Pulmonary status remained 
stable throughout admission.  Anxiety was treated as needed with 
xanax, which was continued from outpatient medications.

# DIABETES - Discontinued oral hypoglycemics while admitted, 
started HISS.  Discharged on previous outpatient regimen.
  
# GERD - on Protonix as outpatient, however also on plavix.  Due 
to drug interaction, protonix was discontinued.  Patient was 
started on ranitidine during admission, but was discontinued due 
to worsening confusion.  Patient was discharged on famotidine.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CORONARIES: Admitted with complaint of chest pain and
shortness of breath. Chest pain reported as a pressure and
similar to her previous anginal sympotms. EKG was unchagned
from prior, sent from PCP. Cardiac enzymes were negative during
admission. Chest pain resolved during admission. Due to
unknown lipids on admission, she was started on high dose statin
and high dose tylenol. Metoprolol was held in setting of
bradycardia. Plavix and Lisinopril continued. Patient did
experience some chest discomfort during admission, but symptoms
were concurrent with episodes of high anxiety and tearfullness
that resolved with xanax.
# RHYTHM: Admitted with sinus bradycardia on EKG in ___ ED.
Nodal blocking agents (toprol, diltiazem and digoxin) were held. Patient was asymptommatic during admission. Records were
obtained which indicated history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, not on anticoagulation due to allergy to coumadin
(cold extremities, tremulousness and somnelance on 2 occasions). Due to concern for ___ syndrome, EP consult recommended
dual chamber pacemaker placement. Pacemaker placed on
___, however RV lead was malfuncitoning on interrogation
the next day. The lead was revised on ___. Patient had
no further complications from the procedure. Toprol XL,
Diltiazem and Digoxin were restarted at previous dose prior to
discharge. No anticoagulation was started based on allergy.
Patient is to ___ in device clinic in 1 week. At her
request, she will arrange cardiology ___ on her own closer
to her home.
# PUMP: No history of systolic or diastolic heart failure per
records. EF not depressed on ___ during admission. Patient
was not fluid overloaded. Continued medical management of CAD
and hypertension.
# HYPERTENSION - Mrs. ___ was admitted with systolic blood
pressures > 140 on admission. Despite bradycardia, she had no
documented hypotensive episodes during her admisison.
Lisinopril and Imdur were conitnued. However, due to
bradycardia, diltizem and Metoprolol were discontinued during
admission. After pacemaker placemaker, Toprol was restarted.
She should ___ with her PCP after discharge for evaluation
of her hypertension.
# DYSPNEA - Slight dyspnea on exam, however lung exam was normal
and oxygen saturation adequate. Patient had no sign of
pulmonary edema and was not diuresed. Pulmonary status remained
stable throughout admission. Anxiety was treated as needed with
xanax, which was continued from outpatient medications.
# DIABETES - Discontinued oral hypoglycemics while admitted,
started HISS. Discharged on previous outpatient regimen.
# GERD - on Protonix as outpatient, however also on plavix. Due
to drug interaction, protonix was discontinued. Patient was
started on ranitidine during admission, but was discontinued due
to worsening confusion. Patient was discharged on famotidine.
___ with PCP ___.
# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY - continued celexa 10 mg qday. xanax given
prn for anxiety.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male admitted to the hospital with right groin pain. 
 Upon admission, the patient was hypotensive with tachycardia 
and there was concern for sepsis.  The patient was started on 
clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl.   He was admitted to the 
intensive care unit for monitoring.  ___ was consulted but were 
unable to place ___ drain because the abscess cavity had 
collapsed.  The patient was taken to the operating room where he 
underwent incision and drainage of right medial and posterior 
thigh.

The operative course was stable.   A kerlex was left in the 
wound and the wound was left open with a ___ drain in place. 
Intra-operatively he received 1u PRBC for low Hct, 1L LR and 
vancomycin. He had a 50cc blood loss.  The patient was extubated 
after the procedure and monitored in the recovery room.  He 
returned to the intensive care unit for monitoring. 

The patient was transferred to the surgical floor on POD #2. He 
resumed a regular diet. His antibiotics were discontinued. The 
___ drain was removed on POD #4 and a vac dressing was 
placed and vac dressing changes undertaken every 3 days.  The 
patient's electrolytes were monitored and he was noted to have a 
sodium between 128 and 133. He was started on a baby aspirin for 
an elevated platelet count.  He continued on his salt tablets. 
In preparation for discharge, the patient was evaluated by 
physical therapy.  Recommendations were  made for discharge to a 
rehabilitation facility to help the patient regain his strength 
and mobility. 

The patient was discharged on POD #9. His vital signs were 
stable and he was afebrile.  His white blood cell count trended 
down and his sodium normalized at 133.  Follow-up appointments 
were made in the acute care clinic.  Discharge instructions were 
reviewed and questions answered.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo RH F with a history of possible HTN (not 
on any anti-HTN medications), Crohn's disease s/p ileostomy, and 
ongoing L corneal infection who presents with a L 
parieto-occipital IPH plus possible new diagnosis of Afib with 
RVR (not on anticoagulation or rate control medications).

She was last known well ___ evening when talking on the phone 
with her daughter at 9 ___ and later sending an email to her 
neighbor. ___ AM, a neighbor who was meeting her at her home for 
breakfast noted that she seemed confused. Ms. ___ answered 
the door for her neighbor but did not respond to questions or 
speak initially. She was grabbing for objects in the air that 
did not exist. There was no evidence of trauma, though her 
daughter did note that there was shampoo on the floor of her 
bathroom and wondered if she'd fallen there. 

She was transported to ___ where she was noted to be 
unable to follow commands or speak. VS were notable for BP 
190s/100s, HR 150s. EKG at OSH showed Afib. NCHCT at 12:20 
showed a 2.5x2.5 cm L parieto-occipital hemorrhage. CTA 
head/neck from OSH was unremarkable. She was given a total of 
Metoprolol 15 mg IV for Afib with RVR and started on a 
Clevidipine gtt for her BPs. At ~ 2PM, Ms. ___ had a focal 
seizure consisting of R head and eye deviation with R arm 
jerking. This lasted for approximately 3 minutes and resolved 
with administration of 2 mg IV Ativan. She was also loaded with 
1000 mg IV Keppra at this time. Repeat NCHCT at ~16:00 showed a 
stable L parieto-occipital IPH but with possible new SAH. 

Ms. ___ daughter notes that she seems to be improved on 
transfer from OSH to here. She feels that she is beginning to 
have some speech output now which she had not previously. She 
also seems more alert to her. 

Ms. ___ has had no history of stroke, syncope, bleeds, and 
no complaints of headaches recently.

IMAGING:
========

CT Head 
IMPRESSION: 
1. A left occipital focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage is 
unchanged from the examination 6 hours prior. The lesion is 
associated with mild surrounding edema and mass effect. A small 
amount of interventricular hemorrhage is seen in the bilateral 
occipital horns. 
2. A subtle hyperdensity in the left temporal lobe may represent 
a tiny focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage versus artifact. 

ECG
Sinus tachycardia. No previous tracing available for comparison. 


ECHO
IMPRESSION: 
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. No 
left ventricular thrombus seen. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. Study is mildly degraded by motion. 
2. Approximately 3.6 x 2.7 x 2.4 cm left occipital 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with adjacent edema, with small area 
of nonspecific minimal enhancement. While finding may represent 
hypertensive hemorrhage, underlying mass is not excluded on the 
basis examination.  Recommend follow-up imaging to resolution. 
3. Approximately 5 x 4 mm right middle cranial fossa dural-based 
probable 
meningioma with mass effect on adjacent right inferior frontal 
lobe. 
4. Limited imaging of cervical spine suggests at least moderate 
vertebral 
canal stenosis at C3-4 level secondary degenerative changes.  If 
clinically indicated, cervical spine MRI may be obtained further 
evaluation. 
5. Small nonspecific bilateral mastoid fluid 

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Extensive metastatic disease with intraparenchymal and 
serosal lesions 
involving the liver and spleen with additional mesenteric and 
retroperitoneal 
nodal lesions.  The largest lesion measures up to 7.9 x 6.8 x 
8.8 cm, serosal 
invading into the left hepatic lobe.  One of the metastatic 
lesions in the 
anterior mesentery appears to be invading into the anterior 
abdominal wall, as 
above. 
2. 2.0 x 1.8 cm sclerotic lesion of the L1 vertebral body 
suspicious for 
osseous metastasis. 
3. Despite the extensive metastatic disease, no definite primary 
lesion is 
identified. 
4. Encapsulated 1.8 x 1.3 cm presacral fluid collection at site 
of prior 
proctectomy.  Though this appears chronic, infection cannot be 
excluded. 
5. Air is seen within the bladder.  Correlate with recent 
instrumentation. 
6. Left lower quadrant diverting ostomy without evidence of 
obstruction. 

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST 

IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  2.3 cm mass in the anteromedial basal segment of the left 
lower lobe.  The differential diagnosis for this mass includes a 
primary lung adenocarcinoma or a metastasis, for example,  colon 
cancer.  If needed, this lesion should be accessible to 
transbronchial or percutaneous sampling. 
2.  Heterogeneous 2.2 cm right thyroid lesion warrants further 
workup with 
ultrasound. 
3.  Ill-defined heterogeneous lucencies in the bilateral ribs do 
not have the appearance of metastases, but multiple myeloma is a 
consideration. 
4.  Several 3 mm or smaller pulmonary nodules, predominantly 
right upper lobe. 
5.  Please refer to the dedicated CT abdomen and pelvis report 
of the same 
date for the subdiaphragmatic findings. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Left Parieto-Occipital IPH
- Patient was transferred from OSH.  Due to need for clevidipine 
gtt for HTN control, she was admitted to the ICU.  This was able 
to be weaned and she was started on metoprolol as below. Her L 
parieto-occipital IPH is most likely secondary to an hemorrhagic 
metastasis given the findings on her chest and abdomen imaging. 
Per daughter, patient with history of melanoma about a year ago. 
Melanoma would, very frequently, metastasize to brain which can 
later cause bleeding. Given multiple body metastases noted on 
imaging, oncology was consulted who recommended biopsy for 
pathological diagnosis and follow up as outpatient.  Patient got 
liver biopsy done on ___ without any complications.  Plan is 
follow up final report and follow up with oncology as outpatient 
for further management.

# Seizure
- At OSH, she had an event of R head and eye deviation with R 
arm jerking which resolved with Ativan.  She was loaded with 
Keppra 1g and subsequently continued on 750mg PO BID.  There 
were no further event.  EEG was deferred given clear cause and 
clinical nature of event. She should continue on Keppra as 
prescribed until her follow up with neurology.

# Atrial Fibrillation
- Patient found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation.  
Metoprolol was initiated for rate control.  She should continue 
on metoprolol as prescribed.
- Started on ASA 81 mg daily for stroke prevention on ___

Transitional Issues:
1. Patient taking modified diet, advance as tolerated and 
advised by speech and swallow.
2. Eye infection: patient should continue on her eye drops as 
prescribed. Follow up with Opthalmology as outpatient
3. Follow up Liver biopsy report. Plan is to follow up with 
oncology once the pathology report is back.  Follow up in ___ 
weeks.
4. Repeat brain MRI within ___ weeks (scheduled for ___ 
at ___ to assess for underlying mass
5. Continue Keppra 750 mg BID
6. Should start ASA 81 mg daily after 1 week of IPH
7. Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg TID for rate management (Afib)
8. Follow up liver biopsy report (done ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of headache/confusion 
resulting from an ACUTE BRAIN HEMORRHAGE, a condition where 
blood accumulates in an area of your brain. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  
Brain hemorrhage can have many different causes, so we assessed 
you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having 
hemorrhage. In order to prevent future hemorrhages, we plan to 
modify some risk factors. Your risk factors are:  
High blood pressure
Age
Possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Atrial fibrillation
Possible metastasis status post melanoma resection
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
Started Metoprolol 12.5 mg TID

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since hemorrhages can 
recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence 
of these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

basis examination. Recommend follow-up imaging to resolution.
3. Approximately 5 x 4 mm right middle cranial fossa dural-based
probable
meningioma with mass effect on adjacent right inferior frontal
lobe.
4. Limited imaging of cervical spine suggests at least moderate
vertebral
canal stenosis at C3-4 level secondary degenerative changes. If
clinically indicated, cervical spine MRI may be obtained further
evaluation.
5. Small nonspecific bilateral mastoid fluid
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive metastatic disease with intraparenchymal and
serosal lesions
involving the liver and spleen with additional mesenteric and
retroperitoneal
nodal lesions. The largest lesion measures up to 7.9 x 6.8 x
8.8 cm, serosal
invading into the left hepatic lobe. One of the metastatic
lesions in the
anterior mesentery appears to be invading into the anterior
abdominal wall, as
above.
2. 2.0 x 1.8 cm sclerotic lesion of the L1 vertebral body
suspicious for
osseous metastasis.
3. Despite the extensive metastatic disease, no definite primary
lesion is
identified.
4. Encapsulated 1.8 x 1.3 cm presacral fluid collection at site
of prior
proctectomy. Though this appears chronic, infection cannot be
excluded.
5. Air is seen within the bladder. Correlate with recent
instrumentation.
6. Left lower quadrant diverting ostomy without evidence of
obstruction.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. 2.3 cm mass in the anteromedial basal segment of the left
lower lobe. The differential diagnosis for this mass includes a
primary lung adenocarcinoma or a metastasis, for example, colon
cancer. If needed, this lesion should be accessible to
transbronchial or percutaneous sampling.
2. Heterogeneous 2.2 cm right thyroid lesion warrants further
workup with
ultrasound.
3. Ill-defined heterogeneous lucencies in the bilateral ribs do
not have the appearance of metastases, but multiple myeloma is a
consideration.
4. Several 3 mm or smaller pulmonary nodules, predominantly
right upper lobe.
5. Please refer to the dedicated CT abdomen and pelvis report
of the same
date for the subdiaphragmatic findings.
Brief Hospital Course:
# Left Parieto-Occipital IPH
- Patient was transferred from OSH. Due to need for clevidipine
gtt for HTN control, she was admitted to the ICU. This was able
to be weaned and she was started on metoprolol as below. Her L
parieto-occipital IPH is most likely secondary to an hemorrhagic
metastasis given the findings on her chest and abdomen imaging.
Per daughter, patient with history of melanoma about a year ago.
Melanoma would, very frequently, metastasize to brain which can
later cause bleeding. Given multiple body metastases noted on
imaging, oncology was consulted who recommended biopsy for
pathological diagnosis and follow up as outpatient. Patient got
liver biopsy done on ___ without any complications. Plan is
follow up final report and follow up with oncology as outpatient
for further management.
# Seizure
- At OSH, she had an event of R head and eye deviation with R
arm jerking which resolved with Ativan. She was loaded with
Keppra 1g and subsequently continued on 750mg PO BID. There
were no further event. EEG was deferred given clear cause and
clinical nature of event. She should continue on Keppra as
prescribed until her follow up with neurology.
# Atrial Fibrillation
- Patient found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation.
Metoprolol was initiated for rate control. She should continue
on metoprolol as prescribed.
- Started on ASA 81 mg daily for stroke prevention on ___
Transitional Issues:
1. Patient taking modified diet, advance as tolerated and
advised by speech and swallow.
2. Eye infection: patient should continue on her eye drops as
prescribed. Follow up with Opthalmology as outpatient
3. Follow up Liver biopsy report. Plan is to follow up with
oncology once the pathology report is back. Follow up in ___
weeks.
4. Repeat brain MRI within ___ weeks (scheduled for ___
at ___ to assess for underlying mass
5. Continue Keppra 750 mg BID
6. Should start ASA 81 mg daily after 1 week of IPH
7. Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg TID for rate management (Afib)
8. Follow up liver biopsy report (done ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of headache/confusion
resulting from an ACUTE BRAIN HEMORRHAGE, a condition where
blood accumulates in an area of your brain. The brain is the
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.
Brain hemorrhage can have many different causes, so we assessed
you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having
hemorrhage. In order to prevent future hemorrhages, we plan to
modify some risk factors. Your risk factors are:
High blood pressure
Age
Possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Atrial fibrillation
Possible metastasis status post melanoma resection
We are changing your medications as follows:
Started Metoprolol 12.5 mg TID
Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since hemorrhages can
recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence
of these symptoms:
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to
you
- sudden weakness of one side of the body
- sudden drooping of one side of the face
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

glands
have an atrophic appearance associated with focal gland dropout,
suggesting a component of ischemic type injury. Possible causes 
of
ischemic type injury include drug effect, certain infections, 
vascular
causes, etc. Clinical correlation is needed. Immunostain for CMV 
is
negative.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a ___ y.o female with h.o collangenous colitis, PMR who 
presents with diarrhea and abdominal bloating 

#Acute on chronic diarrhea (hx collagenous colitis) -ddx 
initially included flare of colitis due to underlying disease 
vs. infection vs.other.  

She was evaluated by her outpatient gastroenterologist (Atrius) 
who performed stool studies (negative including c.diff), and 
colonscopy revealing concern for pseudomembranes, diffuse 
colitis but appearing more c/w infectious etiology. CT on 
admission showed diffuse colitis. The GI service was consulted 
and pt started on po vanco (until C diff negative returned) and 
cipro/flagyl empirically (discontinued after it was decided that 
this did not appear to be bacterial infection). Due to 
persistent sx of diarrhea, sigmoidoscopy performed on ___ 
which showed continuous friability, erythema and ulceration with 
contact bleeding in the rectum and sigmoid colon. On gross view, 
GI thought this might be viral so she was treated ganciclovir 
empirically until path from biopsy returned CMV negative. 

Sigmoid biopsies returned showing ""active colitis with prominent 
regenerative changes and focally distorted architecture. In some 
areas, superficial glands
have an atrophic appearance associated with focal gland dropout, 
suggesting a component of ischemic type injury. Possible causes 
of ischemic type injury include drug effect, certain infections, 
vascular causes, etc. Clinical correlation is needed. 
Immunostain for CMV is negative.""

Ultimately, GI felt that likely diagnosis was colitis due to 
ischemic injury from medication (NSAID - meloxicam). GI 
recommended initiating steroids on ___. By ___, her symptoms 
were much improved (although they were improving prior to 
initiation of steroids). She was discharged home to follow-up 
with her outpatient providers. She was instructed to stop her 
meloxicam. She was discharged on prednisone taper.

# Hypokalemia - Likely due to GI losses. Improved throughout 
admission.  

# Hypoatremia - Sodium was likely initially low ___ hypovolemia. 
Improved somewhat with IVF's. However, sodium remained slightly 
low throughout most of patient's admission (aside from 2 
normalized values). There were few recent prior Na values 
available, but potentially this could represent some chronic 
hyponatremia. Na should be rechecked at follow-up appoint (was 
131 at discharge).

#chronic cough-continued flonase, ordered for prn claritin. Pt 
had outpt f/u with pulmonary arranged prior to admission. No 
signs of PNA or other respiratory infection during admission and 
CXR WNL.

#anemia-appears chronic. HCT remained stable.   
  
#oral candidiasis-pt given nystatin  
  
#Polymyalgia rheumatica- Of note, pt had self-d/c'ed MTX several 
weeks ago. She was instructed to discuss with her 
rheumatologists when she should restart this. Meloxicam was 
d/c'ed as mentioned above. Otherwise, outpt regimen was 
continued at d/c.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for evaluation of diarrhea and abdominal 
distention. CT of the abdomen revealed diffuse colitis and 
sigmoidoscopy here showed continued signs of colitis.  You were 
followed closely by our GI team and treated with antibiotics 
until it was determined you did not have a bacterial infection.  
Your biopsy sample showed acute inflammation and no sign of CMV 
virus.  At this time, our GI specialists have recommended 
steroid therapy.

Of your, your sodium levels were slightly low during your 
admission. You should have your sodium levels rechecked when you 
follow-up with your PCP.

You will taper your steroids as instructed below:
Then take 40 mg (4 tablets) for 4 more days
Then take 30 mg (3 tablets) for 5 days
Then take 20 mg (2 tablets) for 5 days
Then take 10 mg (1 tablet) for 5 days

and pt started on po vanco (until C diff negative returned) and
cipro/flagyl empirically (discontinued after it was decided that
this did not appear to be bacterial infection). Due to
persistent sx of diarrhea, sigmoidoscopy performed on ___
which showed continuous friability, erythema and ulceration with
contact bleeding in the rectum and sigmoid colon. On gross view,
GI thought this might be viral so she was treated ganciclovir
empirically until path from biopsy returned CMV negative.
Sigmoid biopsies returned showing ""active colitis with prominent
regenerative changes and focally distorted architecture. In some
areas, superficial glands
have an atrophic appearance associated with focal gland dropout,
suggesting a component of ischemic type injury. Possible causes
of ischemic type injury include drug effect, certain infections,
vascular causes, etc. Clinical correlation is needed.
Immunostain for CMV is negative.""
Ultimately, GI felt that likely diagnosis was colitis due to
ischemic injury from medication (NSAID - meloxicam). GI
recommended initiating steroids on ___. By ___, her symptoms
were much improved (although they were improving prior to
initiation of steroids). She was discharged home to follow-up
with her outpatient providers. She was instructed to stop her
meloxicam. She was discharged on prednisone taper.
# Hypokalemia - Likely due to GI losses. Improved throughout
admission.
# Hypoatremia - Sodium was likely initially low ___ hypovolemia.
Improved somewhat with IVF's. However, sodium remained slightly
low throughout most of patient's admission (aside from 2
normalized values). There were few recent prior Na values
available, but potentially this could represent some chronic
hyponatremia. Na should be rechecked at follow-up appoint (was
131 at discharge).
#chronic cough-continued flonase, ordered for prn claritin. Pt
had outpt f/u with pulmonary arranged prior to admission. No
signs of PNA or other respiratory infection during admission and
CXR WNL.
#anemia-appears chronic. HCT remained stable.
#oral candidiasis-pt given nystatin
#Polymyalgia rheumatica- Of note, pt had self-d/c'ed MTX several
weeks ago. She was instructed to discuss with her
rheumatologists when she should restart this. Meloxicam was
d/c'ed as mentioned above. Otherwise, outpt regimen was
continued at d/c.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Na should be rechecked at f/u appt
- HSV serologies PENDING at discharge and will need to be
followed up

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with hx of pulmonary fibrosis and 
COPD, with frequent hospitalizations, presented with hypoxemic 
respiratory failure, transferred to ___ intubated and on 
pressors, given concerns for respiratory failure and 
intra-abdominal physiology, here with multiorgan failure .

#Mixed Shock/Multi Organ Failure: Patient presented with 
hypotension, requiring pressor support with evidence of end 
organ hypoperfusion with elevated lactate, LFTs, and anuric 
renal failure. It appeared that his initial chest xray was 
concerning for chronic interstitial process/possible pneumonia, 
with elevated WBC and he has a high bilirubin and LFTs, 
concerning for intrabadominal process including cholecystitis, 
cholangitis, pancreatitis, or hepatitis. Patient may have been 
in ""cold shock"" with high Hct, concern about hemoconcentration 
related to capillary leak from sepsis and minimal preload. ECG 
suggested possible inferior wall ischemia and Troponin is 
elevated. His CVP was ___, with PEEP of 14, arguing for 
hypovolemia, with no clear history suggestive of cardiogenic 
shock. A central line was placed, and he was started on 
Norepinephrine, along with Vasopressin to maintain MAP. NICOM 
trial did not show fluid response. He was started on IV stress 
dose steroids, and then on IV vancomycin/cefepime/metronidazole 
for broad coverage. He was paralyzed to decrease demand.  He 
continued to have difficulty oxygenating as below. His family 
was contacted given his multiorgan failure. They elected to not 
proceed with CVVH as his prognosis still would be poor. Surgical 
consultants including interventional radiology and surgery were 
contacted and recommended no surgical intervention given high 
mortality associated with any invasive procedure. On ___ am, 
Resident physician was called to bedside by RN for asystole. 
Family was at bedside, On exam, patient was without pulse, 
breath sounds, or heart sounds, with no response to painful 
stimuli. Time of death 1:50am. Family declined autopsy. 
 
#Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Respiratory Acidosis: Patient had 
baseline pulmonary fibrosis, COPD with multiple 
hospitalizations, with likely poor respiratory reserve, low 
baseline FVC, with concern for ARDS given bilateral infiltrates 
with a low FIO2/PaO2, triggers being pneumonia vs sepsis from 
intra-abdominal infection. Oxygenation had been inadequate 
despite FIO2 100% and PEEP up to 18. He was switched to APRV and 
was on ARDS net protocol. He passed away given multi organ 
failure as above.

#Transaminitis/Intra-abdominal infection: Patient had started 
reporting abdominal pain at OSH per report, with worsening 
direct bilirubinemia, with concerns for obstruction, but given 
imaging findings, possible cholecystitis that triggered his 
decompensation and sepsis. He may have had a component of shock 
liver as well.  It was unclear the chronicity of liver disease, 
perhaps NASH with possible SBP as the inciting trigger. He was 
not a candidate for any intervention given his critical status. 

#Renal Failure: Patient presented with non gap metabolic 
acidosis, likely in RTA in setting of renal failure. His renal 
failure was likely due to hypoperfusion from sepsis with low CO 
and was anuric. Bladder pressure is approximately ___ and 
there may be an element of abdominal compartment syndrome but 
suspect ATN given hyoperfusion. Patient's family was informed 
about options of CVVH, but ultimately decided against further 
intervention. 

#Coronary Artery Disease/atypical chest pain: Per report, 
patient presented with atypical chest pain, with no gross EKG 
changes and normal troponin. Patient was given full dose 
aspirin. It appears last echocardiogram was with preserved EF 
with possible basal inferior hypokinesis. Bedside ECHO shows 
fairly normal overall cardiac function initially.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old ___ man with a history of HTN,
HLD, DMII, h/o kidney stones, h/o prior vertigo, who experienced
sudden onset dizzines and falling to the R side at 4 ___ today 
and
received TPA at ___ and was transferred to ___ for
further management.

The patient states he was watching a basketball game on TV until
4 ___, when he stood up and suddenly felt dizzy. He describes the
dizzy sensation as having to hold onto something, his whole body
feeling ""off"", and being unable to move without falling to the R
side. He also had mild nausea. He endorses a small vertiginous
component but is not sure this is the same as his prior
experiences of vertigo. He also had a mild R frontal HA. He also
experienced tingling in his L forarm which onset about 10 
minutes
after the dizziness and lasted 20 minutes - no clear sensory
march. He took 2 tylenol but the feeling of falling to the R 
side
continued so he was taken to ___. There neurology 
and
tele-neurology were consulted who found that he was persistantly
falling to the R side with truncal ataxia and they recommended
giving TPA. This was reportedly debated somewhat since his NIHSS
= 0 but it was given and he was sent to ___ for post TPA
monitoring.

In the ___ ED he had an episode of vomiting but was otherwise
feeling about the same as before, with persistant dizziness and
falling to the R when he tried to sit up.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient endorses continued
dizziness as described above.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASESSMENT and PLAN:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w PMHx of HTN, HLD, DMII who 
presented with sudden onset dizzines and falling to the R at 
~1600 on ___ and received tPA at ~1800 at ___. He 
was then transferred to ___ for further management. 
Clinically, his exam is consistent with a cerebellar insult - 
confirmed by imaging. His CTA appears to show a cutoff of the R 
___ and MRI brain shows small, incomplete ___ territory 
infarction with extension into the lateral medulla. 
Etiology is likely multifactorial as he has HTN, HLD, and DM2. 
Mr. ___ was monitoring x24hrs post-24hrs in the ICU with 
optimization of medical risk favors. He was stable >24hrs s/p 
tPA and was transferred to the floor. On the floor, ___ felt that 
givened continued ataxia with gait, he'd benefit from rehab. 
Etiology is unlikely to be artery-artery embolic given clean CTA 
and unlikely to be cardioembolic given clean echo and negative 
telemetry in house. Primary vascular occlusion (given his 
vasculopath risk factors) was felt to be the most likely 
etiology.

OSA control will be extremely important to prevent risk for 
future stroke as well. We do recommend outpatient sleep study 
evaluation for Mr. ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with a stroke in the R back of your brain - 
this caused you to be uncoordinated on the R side. Your risk 
factors for stroke are your high blood pressure, high 
cholesterol, and diabetes and it will be important to keep these 
under good control. 

Given that your cholesterol was high (LDL 105, we like LDL to be 
around 70 after for stroke prevention), we increased your home 
statin dose to Lovastatin 80 mg daily. You should take aspirin 
81 mg daily as well to decrease your risk for future stroke.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old ___ man with a history of HTN,
HLD, DMII, h/o kidney stones, h/o prior vertigo, who experienced
sudden onset dizzines and falling to the R side at 4 ___ today
and
received TPA at ___ and was transferred to ___ for
further management.
The patient states he was watching a basketball game on TV until
4 ___, when he stood up and suddenly felt dizzy. He describes the
dizzy sensation as having to hold onto something, his whole body
feeling ""off"", and being unable to move without falling to the R
side. He also had mild nausea. He endorses a small vertiginous
component but is not sure this is the same as his prior
experiences of vertigo. He also had a mild R frontal HA. He also
experienced tingling in his L forarm which onset about 10
minutes
after the dizziness and lasted 20 minutes - no clear sensory
march. He took 2 tylenol but the feeling of falling to the R
side
continued so he was taken to ___. There neurology
and
tele-neurology were consulted who found that he was persistantly
falling to the R side with truncal ataxia and they recommended
giving TPA. This was reportedly debated somewhat since his NIHSS
= 0 but it was given and he was sent to ___ for post TPA
monitoring.
In the ___ ED he had an episode of vomiting but was otherwise
feeling about the same as before, with persistant dizziness and
falling to the R when he tried to sit up.
On neurologic review of systems, the patient endorses continued
dizziness as described above.
Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending speech.
Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo,
tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
Denies muscle weakness.

FINDINGS:  
  
There is normal flow with respiratory variation in the bilateral 
subclavian 
vein. 
  
The left internal jugular and axillary veins are patent, show 
normal color 
flow and compressibility. 
  
The left brachial vein contains partially occlusive thrombus 
throughout.  The 
left basilic and left cephalic vein demonstrate near occlusive 
thrombus. 
  
No fluid collection is identified. 
  
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Partially occlusive deep vein thrombosis of the brachial 
veins. 
2. Near occlusive thrombus in the left basilic and left cephalic 
vein, 
superficial vessels. 
3. No fluid collection identified. 

___ ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There is a probable 
vegetation on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No 
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1) Possible aortic valve endocarditis (0.3 x 0.3 echo-dense 
undulating structure likely attached to RCC). However, image 
quality not adequate to be certain. Alternatively could be beam 
widening artifiact.
 2) Moderate pulmonary systolic arterial hypertension. LV 
diastolic dysfunction could not be assess however the pulmonary 
acceleration time appears short with possibly mid-systolic 
notching suggesting tentatively that the PASP is elevated due to 
elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (~ ___ ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with h/o opioid dependence and IVDU 
with recent use, 15 weeks pregnant, who presents with L arm 
redness and swelling c/w cellulitis in the setting of recent 
injection drug use in the area, found to have GPC bloodstream 
infection and LUE DVT.

Acute Group A Strep bloodstream infection:
LUE cellulitis with septic thrombophlebitis:
Possible acute aortic valve endocarditis
Source of BSI is LUE cellulitis caused by injection use in that 
arm.  US negative for abscess, though exam has a superficial 
thrombophlebitis.  The erythema has extended beyond the initial 
boundaries, which could be due to her DVT.  She is on 
appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture data so for now 
will monitor.  There is no sign for septic joint currently based 
on exam.  Her echo was reviewed and findings raised concern for 
AV endocarditis/vegetation.  She currently has no signs/symptoms 
of CHF
- ID consulted: recommending CTX 2g IV q24, day 1 = ___.  ___ 
weeks of treatment recommended
- SHE WILL REQUIRE TEE TO EVALUATE FOR AV ENDOCARDITIS.
- Monitor LUE for extension of erythema swelling.  Could 
consider re-imaging  if continues to worsen.
- Pain control with PO and IV Morphine as below.

Hypotension:
Hypotension on the night of admission since stabilized.  Likely 
multifactorial to include clonidine use for withdrawal symptoms 
the first nite, and infection with volume depletion.  BP 
improved with IVF.  Normal lactate re-assuring.
- Clonidine stopped
- Monitor BP.  DC BP 110s/80s

Acute LUE DVT:
Found on US.  Likely provoked in setting of IVDU and cellulitis. 
 Her pregnancy state is also contributing.  This is likely 
contributing to her worsening LUE swelling
- Elevation, warm packs
- Lovenox 1mg/kg q12 startged: 50mg SC q12
- In discussion with ___, recommend continuing therapy for 6 
months and/or 6 weeks after delivery of her baby

Opioid dependence with IVDU and withdrawal:
Has had periods of sobriety with medication maintenance: 
suboxone and methadone in the past.  She came in with mild-mod 
withdrawal, but became hypotensive with clonidine.  Given her 
ongoing pain, she was initiated on PO and IV Morphine which 
would alleviate her withdrawal symptoms.  Please see below for 
dosing.  SW met with the patient and she expressed desire to 
stop IV heroin.

Pregnancy:
US reviewed.  ___ consulted here.  Started prenatal vitamins.  
HIV and HBV negative.  GC/Chlamydia negative.
- RPR, rubella, varicella, PENDING ON TRANSFER

HCV:
HCV serology negative last year.  This is reported and will need 
confirmation

FINDINGS:
There is normal flow with respiratory variation in the bilateral
subclavian
vein.
The left internal jugular and axillary veins are patent, show
normal color
flow and compressibility.
The left brachial vein contains partially occlusive thrombus
throughout. The
left basilic and left cephalic vein demonstrate near occlusive
thrombus.
No fluid collection is identified.

vein,
superficial vessels.
3. No fluid collection identified.
___ ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There is a probable
vegetation on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: 1) Possible aortic valve endocarditis (0.3 x 0.3 echo-dense
undulating structure likely attached to RCC). However, image
quality not adequate to be certain. Alternatively could be beam
widening artifiact.
2) Moderate pulmonary systolic arterial hypertension. LV
diastolic dysfunction could not be assess however the pulmonary
acceleration time appears short with possibly mid-systolic
notching suggesting tentatively that the PASP is elevated due to
elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (~ ___ ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with h/o opioid dependence and IVDU
with recent use, 15 weeks pregnant, who presents with L arm
redness and swelling c/w cellulitis in the setting of recent
injection drug use in the area, found to have GPC bloodstream
infection and LUE DVT.
Acute Group A Strep bloodstream infection:
LUE cellulitis with septic thrombophlebitis:
Possible acute aortic valve endocarditis
Source of BSI is LUE cellulitis caused by injection use in that
arm. US negative for abscess, though exam has a superficial
thrombophlebitis. The erythema has extended beyond the initial
boundaries, which could be due to her DVT. She is on
appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture data so for now
will monitor. There is no sign for septic joint currently based
on exam. Her echo was reviewed and findings raised concern for
AV endocarditis/vegetation. She currently has no signs/symptoms
of CHF
- ID consulted: recommending CTX 2g IV q24, day 1 = ___. ___
weeks of treatment recommended
- SHE WILL REQUIRE TEE TO EVALUATE FOR AV ENDOCARDITIS.
- Monitor LUE for extension of erythema swelling. Could
consider re-imaging if continues to worsen.
- Pain control with PO and IV Morphine as below.
Hypotension:
Hypotension on the night of admission since stabilized. Likely
multifactorial to include clonidine use for withdrawal symptoms
the first nite, and infection with volume depletion. BP
improved with IVF. Normal lactate re-assuring.
- Clonidine stopped
- Monitor BP. DC BP 110s/80s
Acute LUE DVT:
Found on US. Likely provoked in setting of IVDU and cellulitis. Her pregnancy state is also contributing. This is likely
contributing to her worsening LUE swelling
- Elevation, warm packs
- Lovenox 1mg/kg q12 startged: 50mg SC q12
- In discussion with ___, recommend continuing therapy for 6
months and/or 6 weeks after delivery of her baby
Opioid dependence with IVDU and withdrawal:
Has had periods of sobriety with medication maintenance:
suboxone and methadone in the past. She came in with mild-mod
withdrawal, but became hypotensive with clonidine. Given her
ongoing pain, she was initiated on PO and IV Morphine which
would alleviate her withdrawal symptoms. Please see below for
dosing. SW met with the patient and she expressed desire to
stop IV heroin.
Pregnancy:
US reviewed. ___ consulted here. Started prenatal vitamins.
HIV and HBV negative. GC/Chlamydia negative.
- RPR, rubella, varicella, PENDING ON TRANSFER

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with history of hepatitis C 
who presents with accidental PineSol ingestion and was 
subsequently found to have acute renal failure, which improved 
to the patient's approximate baseline with fluids.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============
# Acute renal failure
# Anion gap acidosis: 
The patient presented for accidental PineSol ingestion, but 
admission labs were remarkable for a serum creatinine of 3.7 and 
FENa of 0.44% with a mild gap acidosis. Urinalysis was 
unremarkable and sediment analysis was nondiagnostic. Creatinine 
downtrended with IV fluids, likely in response to volume 
depletion in the setting of poor fluid intake combined with mild 
starvation ketoacidosis from poor PO intake. Cr returned to 
normal at 1.0 at time of discharge.
  
# Toxic Ingestion: 
The patient initially presented to the Emergency Department for 
an accidental PineSol ingestion; per the patient, he had 
accidentally drank approximately 2 tablespoons of cleaner that 
his wife had poured into a cup on a table to use for cleaning, 
thinking it was tea. He denied any suicidal ideations or 
thoughts of self-harm with assessment by psychiatry during 
hospitalization. Admission labs were remarkable for an elevated 
anion gap of 23 that normalized with fluids but thought to be a 
separate process as discussed above. A toxicology consult was 
called, but the amount of toxin the patient ingested and the 
timing of the observed laboratory abnormalities were not 
consistent with damage due to acute toxin ingestion so no 
further intervention was warranted. 

# Polysubstance Abuse: 
The patient endorsed a history of both heroin and cocaine abuse, 
using both substances multiple times per week. Urine toxicology 
screen was positive for both substances on admission. He was 
placed on ___ protocol with lorazepam, methocarbamol, 
loperamide, and Vistaril as needed. A social work consult was 
placed in order to help the patient transition to a ___ 
clinic for further management of opiate abuse, in an effort to 
maintain and promote sobriety.

# Depression: 
The psychiatry consult liaison service was consulted; the 
patient expressed no suicidal or homicidal ideations. He denied 
ingesting PineSol in an effort to harm himself. Recommended 
continued follow-up on an outpatient basis.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============
# Hepatitis C: 
The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C, diagnosed in 
___. Hepatitis C viral load was 8,850,000 IU/mL. The patient 
will follow-up with his new primary care physician for further 
evaluation and treatment.

# Tobacco Abuse: 
The patient was maintained on a nicotine patch while in-house

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
- Needs to regularly establish care with a primary care 
physician, appointment arranged
- Continue Hepatitis C monitoring on an outpatient basis
- Recommend intensive outpatient detoxification program for 
heroin and cocaine addiction with referral for ___ clinic, 
which patient reported had been a barrier before
- Ensure adequate hydration and PO intake given acute kidney 
injury that resolved with fluids
- Recommend outpatient psychiatry referral
- Encourage smoking cessation

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a plasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for an accidental ingestion of 
PineSol. Additionally, your kidneys were injured from inadequate 
fluid intake. You were given IV fluids and your kidney function 
improved. 

Avoiding further heroin and cocaine use is essential for your 
health. You can injure your kidneys and other vital organs, such 
as your brain and your heart with continued drug use. 

Please avoid NSAID use (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) due 
to your kidney injury, you can use Tylenol if needed for pain 
(do not exceed maximum dose of 3 grams per day). 

Please attend all of your follow-up appointments as scheduled. 
If you need to change an appointment, please attempt to make a 
new appointment as close to your originally scheduled

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with history of hepatitis C
who presents with accidental PineSol ingestion and was
subsequently found to have acute renal failure, which improved
to the patient's approximate baseline with fluids.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============
# Acute renal failure
# Anion gap acidosis:
The patient presented for accidental PineSol ingestion, but
admission labs were remarkable for a serum creatinine of 3.7 and
FENa of 0.44% with a mild gap acidosis. Urinalysis was
unremarkable and sediment analysis was nondiagnostic. Creatinine
downtrended with IV fluids, likely in response to volume
depletion in the setting of poor fluid intake combined with mild
starvation ketoacidosis from poor PO intake. Cr returned to
normal at 1.0 at time of discharge.
# Toxic Ingestion:
The patient initially presented to the Emergency Department for
an accidental PineSol ingestion; per the patient, he had
accidentally drank approximately 2 tablespoons of cleaner that
his wife had poured into a cup on a table to use for cleaning,
thinking it was tea. He denied any suicidal ideations or
thoughts of self-harm with assessment by psychiatry during
hospitalization. Admission labs were remarkable for an elevated
anion gap of 23 that normalized with fluids but thought to be a
separate process as discussed above. A toxicology consult was
called, but the amount of toxin the patient ingested and the
timing of the observed laboratory abnormalities were not
consistent with damage due to acute toxin ingestion so no
further intervention was warranted.
# Polysubstance Abuse:
The patient endorsed a history of both heroin and cocaine abuse,
using both substances multiple times per week. Urine toxicology
screen was positive for both substances on admission. He was
placed on ___ protocol with lorazepam, methocarbamol,
loperamide, and Vistaril as needed. A social work consult was
placed in order to help the patient transition to a ___
clinic for further management of opiate abuse, in an effort to
maintain and promote sobriety.
# Depression:
The psychiatry consult liaison service was consulted; the
patient expressed no suicidal or homicidal ideations. He denied
ingesting PineSol in an effort to harm himself. Recommended
continued follow-up on an outpatient basis.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============
# Hepatitis C:
The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C, diagnosed in
___. Hepatitis C viral load was 8,850,000 IU/mL. The patient
will follow-up with his new primary care physician for further
evaluation and treatment.
# Tobacco Abuse:
The patient was maintained on a nicotine patch while in-house
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
- Needs to regularly establish care with a primary care
physician, appointment arranged
- Continue Hepatitis C monitoring on an outpatient basis
- Recommend intensive outpatient detoxification program for
heroin and cocaine addiction with referral for ___ clinic,
which patient reported had been a barrier before
- Ensure adequate hydration and PO intake given acute kidney
injury that resolved with fluids
- Recommend outpatient psychiatry referral
- Encourage smoking cessation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is ___ with h/o CAD who was transferred from ___ 
___ with an NSTEMI. Per report, the patient was at his 
wife's wake earlier in the day, returned to his apartment felt 
unwell and tired, with one episode of emesis. He denied ever 
having chest pain or shortness of breath. As per report, he sat 
down and then went outside for some fresh air, and his symptoms 
improved mildly.  Given the aforementioned symptoms, the patient 
presented to the ___ for eval. Troponin was elevated at 
1.02. EKG was notable for  ""diffuse ST elevations""
Also noted to have creat 1.9, and HCT 25. While there is was 
given full dose ASA and started on heparin drip; also given 
zofran for nausea. The family was undecided about the option for 
cath, but the patient was transferred here in the setting of 
possible cath. 

  
In the ___ ___, inital VS: 96.8 100 113/76 15 100%. The patient 
was found to be in atrial fibrillation (unsure how new). EKG 
revealed ST depression in V2-V4. Posterior EKG with out STE. 
Labs notable for HCT 28; troponin here 0.41. Heparin drip was 
continued. The patient hypotensive in the ___ with SBPs in 
___. He received 1L bolus with minimal improvement in BPs. 
Given anemia, supratherapeutic PTT and hypotension, a rectal was 
performed ( guiac neg).  After rectal was performed the patient 
became unresponsive, eye rolled to the back of his head, became 
bradycardic to the ___ and hypotensive to the ___. Another liter 
of NS was run wide open. Pt's pressure improved to 105/70 with 
three-fourths of the liter in. Decison was made to transfer to 
CCU for further care.

On the floor the patient denies any chest pain and shortness of 
breath. Had on emesis of bilous emesis relieved with zofran.  
Collateral information was obtained from the family. The patient 
had two episodes of syncope while leaving his wife's wake with 
out LOC but no head strike. Was caught by his son prior to 
falling. LOC lasted ___ secs each time, and was then 
responsive to voice. The patient denies any prodromal sx prior 
to the syncope. Never had CP or SOB but was nauseous. He denies 
any prior anginal sx with exertion or at rest prior to this 
episode, but family reports that he has had some decondition 
during the last ___ months secondary to the weather and being 
less active.

Also of note the pt and family report that he has had previous 
vagal episode in the setting of having a colonoscopy.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope

IMAGING

cxr ___
FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly as well as widened mediastinum is 
present, likely from the tortous aorta. The aortic valve is 
calcified.  The lungs are clear of focal opacities concerning 
for pneumonia.  There is no evidence of edema.  No pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax. Costochondral calcifications are noted 
diffusely.  
  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. 

Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 3:31:17 ___      
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%), with some 
regional variation, most c/w CAD (anterior wall/septum are 
slightly more hypokinetic than the rest of the segments). Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate 
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as 
described above. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral and 
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 1600 hours on the day of 
the study.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is ___ with h/o CAD being transferred from ___ with 
NSTEMI

CAD/NSTEMI: The patient has history of CAD admitted with NSTEMI 
by biomarkers with anteriolateral and inferior ST depression. 
NSTEMI likely  demand ischemia secondary to hypotension in the 
setting of vasovagal event, although plaque ruputre could not be 
definetley ruled out. Per discussion with the patient and his 
family they did not want any invasive measures such as cath or 
surgery. Echo was notable for mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size,mild global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%), with some regional variation, most c/w 
CAD (anterior wall/septum are slightly more hypokinetic than the 
rest of the segments). He was started on dual antiplatelet 
therapy with ASA 325, Plavix, with loading dose of 600mg 
followed by 75 mg daily. He was started on high dose 
atorvastatin and metoprolol XL. His lipids and A1c were within 
normal limits. 

# hypotension/bradycardia - The patient had an episode of 
hypotension and bradycardia in ___ after getting a rectal exam. 
which resolved with fluid, did not reqire atropine. The patient 
likely had vagal episode in the setting of rectal exam, as he 
had a similar episode during a colonoscopy in the past. His 
heart rate and blood pressure were stable during his hospital 
course.

# new onset afib- The patient was noted to be in Afib in the ___. 
He reportedly has no documented hx of Afib in the past. His 
CHADS2 score is  2 (age and HTN. He was is NSR on admission to 
the CCU and for the duration of his hosptial course. He was not 
started on long-term anticoagulation and was continued on full 
strength ASA as above.:

# HTN:- The patient was on amlodipine, atenolol, and lisinopril 
at home. Amlodipine, lisinopril and atenolol were disontinued. 
Metoprolol was started as above. 

# Chronic kidney injury- the pt was admitted with a Cr. of 1.8 
per outpatient records his baseline Cr. is  1.6-1.9. Creatinine 
increased on day #3, likely because of hypotensive episode. 
Today is 2.2. 

# Urinary retention: noted that pt was taking terazosin PTA. 
Foley removed and pt having urinary retention. Foley replaced 
and tamsulosin started at hs. Please do voiding trial on ___ 
___ and get urology consult if pt is still unable to void. 

TRANSITONAL ISSUES:
1. See plan above for voiding trial
2. Pt needs outpatient workup of his anemia if not already done
3. No anticoagulation was started for brief episode of AF. Will 
need to reconsider this if AF becomes more persistant. 
 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires 
futher investigation.
1. Atenolol 25 mg PO DAILY 
2. Lisinopril 20 mg PO DAILY 
3. Amlodipine 2.5 mg PO DAILY

IMAGING
cxr ___
FINDINGS: Mild cardiomegaly as well as widened mediastinum is
present, likely from the tortous aorta. The aortic valve is
calcified. The lungs are clear of focal opacities concerning
for pneumonia. There is no evidence of edema. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. Costochondral calcifications are noted
diffusely.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 3:31:17 ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%), with some
regional variation, most c/w CAD (anterior wall/septum are
slightly more hypokinetic than the rest of the segments). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as
described above. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 1600 hours on the day of
the study.
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is ___ with h/o CAD being transferred from ___ with
NSTEMI
CAD/NSTEMI: The patient has history of CAD admitted with NSTEMI
by biomarkers with anteriolateral and inferior ST depression.
NSTEMI likely demand ischemia secondary to hypotension in the
setting of vasovagal event, although plaque ruputre could not be
definetley ruled out. Per discussion with the patient and his
family they did not want any invasive measures such as cath or
surgery. Echo was notable for mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size,mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%), with some regional variation, most c/w
CAD (anterior wall/septum are slightly more hypokinetic than the
rest of the segments). He was started on dual antiplatelet
therapy with ASA 325, Plavix, with loading dose of 600mg
followed by 75 mg daily. He was started on high dose
atorvastatin and metoprolol XL. His lipids and A1c were within
normal limits.
# hypotension/bradycardia - The patient had an episode of
hypotension and bradycardia in ___ after getting a rectal exam.
which resolved with fluid, did not reqire atropine. The patient
likely had vagal episode in the setting of rectal exam, as he
had a similar episode during a colonoscopy in the past. His
heart rate and blood pressure were stable during his hospital
course.
# new onset afib- The patient was noted to be in Afib in the ___.
He reportedly has no documented hx of Afib in the past. His
CHADS2 score is 2 (age and HTN. He was is NSR on admission to
the CCU and for the duration of his hosptial course. He was not
started on long-term anticoagulation and was continued on full
strength ASA as above.:
# HTN:- The patient was on amlodipine, atenolol, and lisinopril
at home. Amlodipine, lisinopril and atenolol were disontinued.
Metoprolol was started as above.
# Chronic kidney injury- the pt was admitted with a Cr. of 1.8
per outpatient records his baseline Cr. is 1.6-1.9. Creatinine
increased on day #3, likely because of hypotensive episode.
Today is 2.2.
# Urinary retention: noted that pt was taking terazosin PTA.
Foley removed and pt having urinary retention. Foley replaced
and tamsulosin started at hs. Please do voiding trial on ___
___ and get urology consult if pt is still unable to void.
TRANSITONAL ISSUES:
1. See plan above for voiding trial
2. Pt needs outpatient workup of his anemia if not already done
3. No anticoagulation was started for brief episode of AF. Will
need to reconsider this if AF becomes more persistant.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL
Patient was admitted on a conditional voluntary.
<br>
2. PSYCHIATRIC
On admission the patient was placed on 15 minutes checks because 
he felt safe, was not actively suicidal and reported he would be 
able to talk to staff if he developed thoughts of hurting 
himself. A safety plan was made and placed in his chart. On 
admission the patient's trazodone was stopped and he was started 
on Mirtazapine 7.5mg QHS to help improve his sleep, mood and 
anxiety. He reported continued poor sleep so his Mirtazapine was 
increased to 15mg and then again to 30mg daily. Hydroxazine 50mg 
PRN was used for anxiety throughout the day with good clinical 
effect. The patient requested Wellbutrin and trazodone, but he 
was encouraged to be patient with the Mirtazapine as he had only 
been on it for a couple of days. By hospital day 5 the patient 
reported that his sxs had much improved on mirtazepine. He was 
feeling less anxious and depressed and also reported that he was 
more hopeful about the future. He had several goals in place 
including working on his housing and improving his physical 
health (via diet and exercise) to address his new onset DM. He 
had no further thoughts of self harm. He was tolerating the 
mirtazepine well. He was discharged on Mirtazepine as well as 
Hydroxazine PRN QHS. 
<br>
3. MEDICAL
On ED admission the pt was noted to have an elevated glucose at 
327. Repeat labs 9 hours later revealed a persistent elevated 
Glu of 239. A hemoglobin A1c and lipid profile were notable for 
hgba1c 7.4 and elevated triglyceride of 361. The pt denied 
personal h/o of DM but reported a strong family h/o of 
adult-onset ___ clinic was consulted for further recs. 
They evaluated the pt and diagnosed him with diabetes mellitus. 
He was started on Glyburide 5mg daily and Lispro Insulin sliding 
scale. He had finger sticks QAC and QHS and closely monitored by 
___. His BS remained not well controlled and thus his 
glyburide was increased to 5mg BID and then later to 7.5mg BID. 
He also required insulin coverage via sliding scale. He was not 
started on Metformin secondary to elevated LFTs (ALT 104, AST 
49) believed to be due to his h/o of Hep C and/or past Etoh 
abuse. His LFTs did later improve (suggesting ETOH hepatitis as 
the source) but metformin was still avoided given pt's strong 
ETOH hx and concern that if he would relapse it would be 
dangerous for him to be on Metformin. Insulin as an outpt was 
discussed with ___. They felt that given that the pt is 
homeless, has no current outpt PCP and it is unclear whether he 
could be able to handle insulin injections on his own, it was 
best that insulin be avoided as an outpt especially as his BS 
were showing improving with oral agents alone. Nutrition was 
consulted to help the pt develop better eating habits. The 
patient was also provided with handouts educating him on 
Diabetes and the ___ provided him with a glucometer. 
The ___ clinic did wish to see the patient as an outpatient 
and the clinic was contacted to schedule an appt for the 
patient. Unfortunately at the timing of this note the clinic had 
not yet established a specific appt date. The patient was 
provided with their number and instructed to call there and 
arrange to be seen in one month by Dr. ___ 
fellow. The patient's PCP, ___, was also contacted. She was 
not available to make an appt so the patient was instructed to 
contact her office and make a f/u appt within the next ___ 
weeks.
<br>
4. PSYCHOSOCIAL
The patient made an effort to attend groups at times. He 
intermittently participated in the milieu. During the first few 
days of admission his mood was occassionally a bit labile 
especially with regards to decisions about his disposition 
planning. However by the time of discharge he was pleasant and 
cooperative and was eager to work with the social worker and 
case manager to help with his disposition. 
<br>
5. DISPO
Patient is being discharged to ___ program ___ 
___ ___. Since he 
is being discharged to this facility and thereafter to a partial 
program, they will need to arrange for outpatient treaters 
including psychiatrist and therapist. As noted in HPI, the 
patient currently does not have a psychiatrist or therapist.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL
Patient was admitted on a conditional voluntary.
<br>
2. PSYCHIATRIC
On admission the patient was placed on 15 minutes checks because
he felt safe, was not actively suicidal and reported he would be
able to talk to staff if he developed thoughts of hurting
himself. A safety plan was made and placed in his chart. On
admission the patient's trazodone was stopped and he was started
on Mirtazapine 7.5mg QHS to help improve his sleep, mood and
anxiety. He reported continued poor sleep so his Mirtazapine was
increased to 15mg and then again to 30mg daily. Hydroxazine 50mg
PRN was used for anxiety throughout the day with good clinical
effect. The patient requested Wellbutrin and trazodone, but he
was encouraged to be patient with the Mirtazapine as he had only
been on it for a couple of days. By hospital day 5 the patient
reported that his sxs had much improved on mirtazepine. He was
feeling less anxious and depressed and also reported that he was
more hopeful about the future. He had several goals in place
including working on his housing and improving his physical
health (via diet and exercise) to address his new onset DM. He
had no further thoughts of self harm. He was tolerating the
mirtazepine well. He was discharged on Mirtazepine as well as
Hydroxazine PRN QHS.
<br>
3. MEDICAL
On ED admission the pt was noted to have an elevated glucose at
327. Repeat labs 9 hours later revealed a persistent elevated
Glu of 239. A hemoglobin A1c and lipid profile were notable for
hgba1c 7.4 and elevated triglyceride of 361. The pt denied
personal h/o of DM but reported a strong family h/o of
adult-onset ___ clinic was consulted for further recs.
They evaluated the pt and diagnosed him with diabetes mellitus.
He was started on Glyburide 5mg daily and Lispro Insulin sliding
scale. He had finger sticks QAC and QHS and closely monitored by
___. His BS remained not well controlled and thus his
glyburide was increased to 5mg BID and then later to 7.5mg BID.
He also required insulin coverage via sliding scale. He was not
started on Metformin secondary to elevated LFTs (ALT 104, AST
49) believed to be due to his h/o of Hep C and/or past Etoh
abuse. His LFTs did later improve (suggesting ETOH hepatitis as
the source) but metformin was still avoided given pt's strong
ETOH hx and concern that if he would relapse it would be
dangerous for him to be on Metformin. Insulin as an outpt was
discussed with ___. They felt that given that the pt is
homeless, has no current outpt PCP and it is unclear whether he
could be able to handle insulin injections on his own, it was
best that insulin be avoided as an outpt especially as his BS
were showing improving with oral agents alone. Nutrition was
consulted to help the pt develop better eating habits. The
patient was also provided with handouts educating him on
Diabetes and the ___ provided him with a glucometer.
The ___ clinic did wish to see the patient as an outpatient
and the clinic was contacted to schedule an appt for the
patient. Unfortunately at the timing of this note the clinic had
not yet established a specific appt date. The patient was
provided with their number and instructed to call there and
arrange to be seen in one month by Dr. ___
fellow. The patient's PCP, ___, was also contacted. She was
not available to make an appt so the patient was instructed to
contact her office and make a f/u appt within the next ___
weeks.
<br>
4. PSYCHOSOCIAL
The patient made an effort to attend groups at times. He
intermittently participated in the milieu. During the first few
days of admission his mood was occassionally a bit labile
especially with regards to decisions about his disposition
planning. However by the time of discharge he was pleasant and
cooperative and was eager to work with the social worker and
case manager to help with his disposition.
<br>
5. DISPO
Patient is being discharged to ___ program ___
___ ___. Since he
is being discharged to this facility and thereafter to a partial
program, they will need to arrange for outpatient treaters
including psychiatrist and therapist. As noted in HPI, the
patient currently does not have a psychiatrist or therapist.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with h/o HTN, PMR, hypothyroidism, severe 
scoliosis, OA with recent weight loss presenting after an 
episode of confusion which has now resolved.  
.  
# Altered mental status: 
Briefly, the patient described feeling ""shaking inside"" in the 
evening, and was nervous, went to sleep around midnight and woke 
up the following day at 2pm when her daughter came by.  Patient 
had not been eating or taking her meds at home the day of her 
confusional episode per her daughter and was not making sense on 
finding her after she had woken up, but there was no evidence of 
neurologic abnormalities, urinary or fecal incontinnce or trauma 
and patient remembers feeling disoriented and no observed 
seizure acitivity, making seizure unlikely. She denies CP and 
ECG was unremarkable for ischemic changes but does have somewhat 
prolonged QT, but ACS unlikley. Could have been arrythmia, but 
sx do not seem to fit with this and no LOC. She has no focal 
infectious findings and CXR, UA and head CT were unremarkable 
and she is afebrile. Her TSH on ___ was 4.1, making 
hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism very unlikley. Also, consider 
depression, but unlikely to present with an acute altered mental 
status. Given her poor PO intake, it is possible that she became 
dehydrated and delerious from this. The only laboratory 
abnormality was hypokalemia which may be nutritional in 
combination with diuretic. She is also on meds that can cause 
confusion including neurontin and mirtazapine, but there have 
been no recent changes in the doses and she is now asymptomatic. 
She has been on the neurontin and tramadol for ___ years per her 
daughter-the daughter investigated her pill box and they were 
correctly allotted.  

Pt completed her ___, no events on tele. She is currently close 
to her baseline as per her daughter and patient. Daughter aids 
the patient very much and is interested in home services.  

B12, folate, TSH were checked and within normal limits, RPR 
pending.
Her state of ""inner shakiness"" is felt to be due to 
hypovolemia/lack of po intake, and possibly medication effect.  
She will be going home with her daughter, then will have home 
services.  Her family and the patient are not interested in 
placement at this time. They will arrange for a companion for 
the patient throughout the day.
.  
# Hypokalemia: Likely nutritional and may have baseline loses 
___ to diuretic  
She will go home on 20mg po q day K-dur until ___ when it 
will be rechecked, and followed up by her PCP.

# HTN: continued on her home meds  
.  
# ___ edema: left lower extremity more edematous than the right 
in the past, chronic from left hip surgery, no palpable cords, 
right ___ appeared more edematous on this admission, ___ was 
done which was negative for DVT.
.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH 4.4. Continue levothyroxine  
.  
# OA: continue neurontin, celebrex, tramadol  
.  
# GERD/hiatal hernia: continnued reglan, PPI and H2 blocker  
.  
# FEN/GI - diet, electrolyte repletion prn  
.  
# PPx - hep sc, bowel regimen  
.  
# Code - Full for now as she feels ""if something could be done I 
would want it, but I wouldn't wantto be kept on machines."" In 
discussion, seems that she is considering being DNR/DNI but has 
not specifically decided this or discussed this with her 
daughter ___, who is her HCP.

Ms. ___ was in her usual state of health yesterday morning. 
She notes she felt quite well. However, around noon time while 
she was driving she describes acute onset abdominal cramping, 
which were primarily ___ in nature. Due to these 
cramps, she decided to drive back home. As she got out her car, 
she felt lightheaded and diaphoretic and had a syncopal episode. 
She was down for a few minutes then was able to get up and go 
into her home. She went to the restroom and had an episode of 
hematochezia. As we went to get up from the toilet, she again 
felt lightheaded and had a syncopal episode. This cycle repeated 
about 4 times with repeated syncopal episodes as she tried to 
stand up and episodes of hematochezia. She also noted right 
ankle pain. Due to the repeat episodes as well as her right 
ankle pain, she decided to go to the hospital. 

Notably, she describes previously episodes of significant 
cramping in the past which has attributed to IBS. Her last 
bleeding episodes was about ___ years ago, she does not recall 
what the etiology was.

She has been eating and drinking well, but admits she has been 
under significant amount of stress. She does not take NSAIDs or 
other blood thinners. Her last colonoscopy was in ___ and it 
showed hemorrhoids. She notes she has had awake colonoscopies 
due to her risk with sedation given her myasthenia ___. 

In the ___, she was hemodynamically stable without 
significant decrease in her Hct. However, her CBC showed 19% 
bands. ___ with Cr: 1.6 ___: 0.9-1). Lactate of 1.7. Troponin: 
0.01.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia without ischemic changes. CT 
(w/ PO contrast) showed colonic wall thickening involving the 
distal transverse colon and descending colon. They noted 
ischemic colitis as their primary differential. She also had R 
ankle XR which was initially read without fracture, however has 
subsequently been read as nondisplaced oblique fracture of the 
distal fibular shaft. Due to her significant bandemia and 
concern for decompensation, she was transferred to the ___.

In the ___ ___, she continued to be HD stable. Her labs were 
stable with resolved bandemia and improved renal function. GI 
was consulted in the ___.

During my interview, she notes her pain has resolved. She has 
had subsequent bowel movement without evidence of hematochezia.

      are rare. 
      FEW POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES. 

Colonoscopy:
Erythema and petechiae in the sigmoid colon and distal 
descending colon compatible with mild colitis (biopsy)
The prep was inadequate to detect polyps. Because of the poor 
prep in the cecum, the terminal ileum was unable to be entered.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

CT A/P Second Read - IMPRESSION: 
Limited noncontrast examination demonstrates likely thickening 
of the
descending colon, suggestive of colitis.  This finding is 
nonspecific, but
most likely infectious.  Given relatively limited 
atherosclerotic disease
burden, ischemic colitis is thought to be less likely.

TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top 
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). The estimated cardiac index is 
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for 
left ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber 
size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Borderline dilated left 
ventricular cavity size with mild global hypokinesis. Normal 
right ventricular cavity size with mild global hypokinesis. No 
pathologic valvular findings. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/p sarcoid, myasthenia ___ s/p thymectomy, hypertension, 
secondary hyperparathyroidism, GERD, SIBO, osteopenia, thyroid 
nodule who initially presented to ___ with syncope 
___ transferred to ___ due to concern for 
ischemic colitis.

# GIB: DDx included infections colitis, ischemic colitis, AVM or 
diverticular bleed. While there was initial concern for ischemic 
colitis on OSH CT, second read of CT here was not felt to be 
consistent with this etiology. She had no further bleeding 
episodes here and H/H remained relatively stable after initial 
slight downtrend. Of note, on further discussion with the 
patient, she endorses a long standing ___ year) history of 
intermittent abdominal cramping sometime associated with syncope 
and/or hematochezia. She underwent colonoscopy here which only 
showed mild colitis. Biopsies were pending at the time of 
discharge and will need to be followed up. The patient was urged 
to continue to follow up with GI as an outpatient for continued 
evaluation of her symptoms.

# Syncope: Ultimately seemed most consistent with vasovagal 
etiology (she endorses intermittent abdominal cramping as above, 
with associated syncope when cramping is particularly bad). No 
events on telemetry. TTE without significant valvular pathology. 
ECG was checked on the day of discharge for QT monitoring and 
did show some nonspecific T wave changes compared to admission 
ECG and priors. Pt never complained of chest discomfort. 
Troponin was checked and was normal. This was communicated with 
her PCP via phone conversation.

# Pancytopenia: Etiology not entirely clear. Possible component 
of acute blood loss anemia initially and platelet consumption in 
the setting of GI bleed. Counts were stable at the time of 
discharge. Pt should have CBC repeated at ___ appointment next 
week and should be referred for further evaluation if cell 
counts remain low.

# Right ankle fracture: Occurred during syncopal episode. Ortho 
involved. Recommended boot, WBAT, follow up in ___ days.

# Myasthenia ___: Pt had previously undergone awake 
colonoscopies ___ concern for sedation in the setting of her 
known MG. However, after discussion with her neurologist, she 
underwent colonoscopy this admission with conscious sedation. 
She tolerated this without issue.

# Systolic Dysfunction: TTE showed EF of 40-45%. Pt endorses 
known h/o systolic dysfunction ___ ""viral illness"" for which she 
sees a cardiologist. She should continue to follow with 
cardiology.

# HTN: Antihypertensive agents on hold in the setting of GIB. 
Given that BP was on the low end of normal throughout admission, 
only restarted HCTZ at discharge. BP should be rechecked at 
follow up appointment and lisinopril restarted as needed.

# Anxiety: Continued Ativan, Fluoxetine and Nortryptiline.

# Osteopenia: Continuing calcitriol and vita.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Needs GI and cardiology f/u. F/u in ___ clinic as scheduled.
- Please repeat CBC at f/u appointment to ensure improvement in 
pancytopenia.
- Please repeat ECG at f/u appointment as discussed.
- Please repeat BP at f/u appointment and consider restarting 
lisinopril as needed.
- GI bx pending at the time of discharge and will need to be 
followed up.

Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the hospital with abdominal cramping and GI 
bleeding. There was concern for possible colitis, and you were 
transferred to ___ for further evaluation. You were seen by 
our GI team, and you underwent a colonoscopy. You had no further 
episodes of bleeding here, and your blood counts have been 
stable. It is important that you follow up with your doctors to 
review the findings of your colonoscopy.

Your presentation was also notable for an episode of passing out 
(this has happened to you in the past as well in the setting of 
abdominal cramping). You sustained an ankle fracture from this. 
You were fitted with an aircast boot. You need to follow up in 
orthopedics clinic as instructed. 

It was a pleasure taking part in your medical care.

transferred to ___ for further evaluation. You were seen by
our GI team, and you underwent a colonoscopy. You had no further
episodes of bleeding here, and your blood counts have been
stable. It is important that you follow up with your doctors to
review the findings of your colonoscopy.
Your presentation was also notable for an episode of passing out
(this has happened to you in the past as well in the setting of
abdominal cramping). You sustained an ankle fracture from this.
You were fitted with an aircast boot. You need to follow up in
orthopedics clinic as instructed.
It was a pleasure taking part in your medical care.

evaluation he was found to have a left atrial tachycardia with a 
moderately fast ventricular response. He was started on Xarelto 
on ___ and had his Flecainide increased to twice day. His 
arrhythmia has persisted and yesterday he reports that this 
heart rate had been in the 140's. His Metoprolol was increased 
to 25mg three times a day. Overall, he has been feeling very 
anxious without any sensation of a rapid heartbeat. He is aware 
of some dyspnea with exertion and intermittent lightheadedness. 
He was referred for PVI/LAT ablation.

On ___, he was successfully cardioverted. During the

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

Thank you for choosing us for your care. You were admitted to 
the general medicine service at ___ for treatment of an 
episode of presyncope (near-fainting) in the setting of low 
blood pressure. Your labs also showed acute kidney injury which 
can arise in the setting of dehydration. The underlying cause of 
this event is thought to be a combination of recent changes in 
your psychiatric medications, insufficient oral hydration, and 
an extensive antihypertension regimen (which was initiated when 
you were previously on adderall and may not be needed moving 
forward). 

We treated you with normal saline fluid resuscitation and your 
blood pressure returned to within normal limits. We also 
temporarily discontinued nifedipine, lisinopril, and labetalol. 
We restarted labetalol at a lower dose of 200 mg po three times 
a day on the day of discharge but we do not feel that you need 
the other anti-hypertensives, especially since you are no longer 
taking adderall. We also monitored your heart on telemetry to 
rule-out any signs of arrythmia which can also be the cause of a 
near-syncopal episode. Finally, your kidney function tests 
returned to the normal baseline after your hydration improved.  

We recommend that you see your primary care physician within the 
next week for a blood pressure check and reevaluation of your 
antihypertensive medications. We also recommend that you see 
your psychiatrist Dr. ___ to discuss the role that your 
psychiatric medications may have contributed to this episode of 
low blood pressure and dehydration.

patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
worsened symptoms of depression, increased alcohol intake, and 
suicidal ideation with plan but no intent.  Their static factors 
noted at that time include history of substance abuse, recent 
discharge from an inpatient psychiatric unit, age, and chronic 
medical illness.   The modifiable risk factors including 
suicidal ideation, hopelessness, limited coping skills, and 
substance abuse were addressed with alcohol detoxification on 
CIWA protocol, medication changes including starting Prozac, 
group/milieu therapy, and motivational interviewing.  Finally, 
the patient is being discharged with many protective risk 
factors, including help-seeking nature, future-oriented 
viewpoint, sense of responsibility to family, children in the 
home, lack of suicidal ideation and strong social supports.  
Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at this time, 
the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others. 

Our Prognosis of this patient is fair, based on above mentioned 
medication adjustments and inpatient therapies. However, the 
patient is at high risk of relapse based on history of relapse 
and continued access to alcohol.

# Sinus Tachycardia: Typical causes of sinus tachycardia were 
exluded. Met ___ SIRS criteria on presentation (tachycardia and 
leukocytosis), but without fevers or infectious symptoms making 
sepsis or shock unlikely. She was clinically euvolemic, and did 
not have an anemia. CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism at 
OSH on ___, and ACS excluded by ECG and lack of chest pain. She 
did not have signs of heart failure, respiratory disease, or 
hypoxia. She did not have findings of hyperthyroidism, and her 
TSH was within normal limits. Her caffeine intake is relatively 
minimal (one cup a day). Interestingly, she was recently on 
prednisone for a bronchitis (also administered a Z-pac and 
steroid inhaler); it was after a similiar illness in ___ that 
she developed similar sinus tachycardia, for which she is 
followed by Electrophysiology. Here, aside from prednisone, 
Z-pac, and steroid inhaler, her only other medication adjustment 
was re-addition of Abilify on ___ that she has been on before 
without ill-effect. Pheochromocytoma and carcinoid syndrome were 
thought highly unlikely given their overall low prevalence, and 
lack of hypertension, flushing, diarrhea. She had a previously 
normal EP study in ___ here, her loop recorder was 
interrogated by EP who found no arrhythmia. As her tachycardia 
resolved overnight while she slept, she was determined to be 
appropriate for outpatient follow-up of this condition, and was 
discharged to follow-up with Electrophysiology. Her home 
metoprolol (with which she claims compliance) was continued. 
Home atomoxetine was held (not on formulary).
