1,1,12975485,What were the clinical interventions performed on the patient and what was their effect on patient's primary complaint of headache?,"The patient was administered Vitamin D and had her ankle evaluated through an x-ray. As a result, her headache was minimally improved.",The patient was given ibuprofen and a blood patch was performed. This brought a brief relief to her headache.,The patient was treated with a blood patch procedure which substantially improved her headache symptoms.,A urinalysis was performed and a CT scan was carried out in the ED. The patient's headache was relieved for a short period of time.,"The patient studied her family history, underwent LP twice, and had an ankle xray. This resulted in no change in her headache.",C,"In the discharge summary, it is clear that the clinical interventions conducted were the administration of pain relieving medications such as vicodin and fioricet, and performing a 'blood patch' procedure. The effect on the patient's headache was significant as she showed improvement post intervention, per the summary notes. Answers A, D, and E, while mentioning other procedures performed, do not correctly identify the main intervention (blood patch) for the headache. B describes correct interventions but understates the relief provided by the blood patch procedure."
2,1,19573484,What kind of allergy does the patient have and was there an instance where it was triggered during the patient's stay in the hospital?,"The patient has an allergy to levothyroxine, which was triggered post-surgery.","The patient is allergic to amoxicillin and other penicillins, but there's no record of it being triggered during their hospital stay.","The patient has an allergy to calcium supplements, which caused some complications post-surgery.",The patient has a thyroid cancer allergy which couldn't be avoided due to the nature of their condition.,"The patient has an allergy to acetaminophen, and the allergic reaction was noted during their hospital stay.",B,"The patient's allergy to amoxicillin and other penicillins is documented in the discharge summary. However, while the patient was given various medications during their hospital stay, amoxicillin or other penicillins were not on that list, so the allergy was not triggered. Option A, C, D, and E are incorrect because no allergy to levothyroxine, calcium supplements, thyroid cancer, or acetaminophen is mentioned in the text. Furthermore, thyroid cancer is a disease, not an allergen, making Option D nonsensical."
3,1,14357885,What was the patient's initial presenting condition and what was the course of treatment or interventions taken during the hospital stay?,Patient initially presented with a cardiac arrest and was transferred to another hospital after showing signs of cerebral edema.,"Patient initially presented with heart congestion, treated through a process of resuscitation, and died shortly afterward.",The patient initially presented with cerebral herniation and was subjected to a severe regimen of blood pressure support interventions.,"The patient initially presented with a seizure, underwent surgical interventions, but couldn't survive the heart failure.","Patient initially presented with brain stroke and multiple blood pressure supports were applied, but he did not survive.",A,"In the notes, it is mentioned that the patient's chief complaint was 'Cardiac Arrest.' He was found unconscious, and resuscitation was started. After regaining spontaneous circulation, he had severe edema and a high troponin level, indicating a cardiac issue. Patient was also placed on epi drip. A major indication of this was his unresponsiveness and high requirement for blood pressure support. Other conditions mentioned in the options like heart congestion, seizure, brain stroke are not mentioned in the summary. Although he had 'severe cerebral edema', it was not his initial presentation but a result of his cardiac arrest, differentiating option A from C. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
4,1,14446581,What was the diagnosis of the female patient's urinary infection and her treatment plan as per the discharge summary provided on 2123-06-08?,The patient was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was treated with apanol.,The patient was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and given a course of ciprofloxacin.,The patient was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection but no treatment was given because the patient was allergic to antibiotics.,The patient was diagnosed with a vaginal infection and was treated with ciprofloxacin.,The patient was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was treated with lisinopril.,B,"The notes confirm that the female patient was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, and the treatment plan included a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin. Choice A, apanol, is not mentioned anywhere in the notes. Choice C is incorrect because, although the patient was indeed diagnosed with a UTI, she was given treatment, and there is no mention of the patient being allergic to antibiotics. Choice D is incorrect because the patient was diagnosed with a UTI, not a vaginal infection. E is incorrect because lisinopril was prescribed for the patient's hypertension, not her UTI. Hence, choice B is the correct answer."
5,1,19323119,What specific operative procedure did the patient undergo during her hospital stay and what were the post-operative instructions provided to her for mobility and care of her affected leg?,The patient underwent a surgery for her cervical CA and was instructed to remain bedridden for a few weeks.,"The patient had an ORIF procedure carried out on her right patella fracture and was advised to limit mobility exercised as tolerated to her right leg, not bend her right knee, and take her Lovenox injections as per instructions.",The patient underwent an operation for depression and was asked to maintain weight bearing on both her legs.,The patient had a lung operation and was told to avoid bending her knee.,The patient had a TAH performed and was told to continue being weight bearing as tolerated on her left leg.,B,"As per the discharge summary, the patient underwent an ORIF (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation) for her right patella fracture (knee) (note section: Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure). The post-operative instructions include: ""weight bearing as tolerated on your right leg"", ""Do NOT bend your right knee"", keeping the brace on at all times except for daily care/hygiene, and continuing Lovenox injections for 4 weeks post-surgery (note section: Discharge Instructions and Physical Therapy). The other options are incorrect as they either refer to treatments not carried out in this situation (A, C, D, E) or post-operative instructions not consistent with the discharge summary (A, C, D, E)."
6,1,16569715,"What medications was the patient prescribed upon discharge, and for what reason were these prescribed?",The patient was prescribed albuterol for maintenance of asthma.,"The patient was prescribed hydrocodone-acetaminophen, calcium carbonate, levothyroxine, and Colace to manage pain, regulate calcium levels, support thyroid function, and assist digestion respectively.",The patient was prescribed TUMS 1000 for digestive health.,The patient was prescribed calcium carbonate to manage lower calcium output post-surgery.,The patient was prescribed levothyroxine to manage her history of reflux.,B,"The patient was prescribed hydrocodone-acetaminophen for pain relief after surgery, calcium carbonate to manage lower calcium levels, often evident post-thyroidectomy, levothyroxine to replace the lost thyroid hormone due to the surgery, and Colace to prevent constipation potentially caused by a narcotic pain relief regime. In contrast, albuterol was a medication on admission, not upon discharge (A). TUMS were a part of pre-surgery regimen, not specified in the discharge medications (C). While calcium carbonate was given to manage lower calcium levels (D), the answer is incomplete as it does not mention all the discharge medications. Levothyroxine was given to manage thyroid function not reflux (E)."
7,1,18437673,What interventions were taken to manage the patient's condition of anemia during her admission?,The patient's anemia required an initiation of penicillin treatment.,She underwent tocolysis to manage her anemia.,She was administered cephalexin to address her anemic condition.,The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) without any complications.,Iron tablets were discontinued during her stay to manage her anemia.,D,"In the provided summary it is mentioned that on Post-Operative Day (POD) 2, a transfusion was strongly recommended for the patient due to her severe anemia, though initially, the patient declined. Later on POD 3, the patient agreed to the transfusion and was given 2 units of PRBCs without any complications, hence, option D is the correct answer. The other options, though mentioned in the summary, are incorrect because penicillin and cephalexin were given for group-B strep positive and recurrent Proteus UTI respectively (option A and C). Tocolysis was a part of her past medical history when she had preterm labor (option B) and iron tablets were part of both her admission and discharge medications (option E), indicating continuity rather than a direct intervention for her severe anemia. Thus, options A, B, C, and E serve as good distractors, although are incorrect."
8,1,11106534,What symptoms initially brought the patient to the hospital and what treatment was administered during her stay?,The patient came to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain and was treated with amlodipine and azithromycin.,"The patient presented with a fever, productive cough, and wheeze, and was treated with levofloxacin, nebulizers, solumedrol, and a steroid burst, with azithromycin prescribed upon discharge.",The patient was admitted due to symptoms of hypertension and was treated with fosamax and detrol.,The patient came in with symptoms of anastomosis and was treated with albuterol and ferrous sulfate.,The patient came to the hospital with symptoms of pneumonia and was treated with calcium and vitamin D supplements.,B,"The patient presented with fever, productive cough, and wheeze as mentioned under 'Chief Complaint' and 'History of Present Illness' in the provided notes. During the hospital stay, the patient received levofloxacin, nebulizers, and solumedrol as mentioned under 'Brief Hospital Course'. Furthermore, upon discharge, the patient was given azithromycin and was on a 'steroid burst' as indicated in 'Discharge Medications'. For the other options, all the medications and symptoms mentioned are present in the notes, but they do not correctly answer the question. For instance, while the patient does have hypertension (Option C), the condition doesn't seem to be the reason for hospital admission, nor the main focus during treatment. Similarly, the patient did not exhibit symptoms of chest pain or pneumonia (Options A and E), and while some of the mentioned medications were administered during the hospital stay, they were not the primary treatment. The patient also did not present symptoms of anastomosis (Option D), making it an incorrect option."
9,1,14233954,What were the measures taken to control the patient's pain post-discharge following his skiing accident that led to a splenic laceration?,The patient was given a topical analgesic cream.,"The patient was prescribed Acetaminophen and OxycoDONE, both to be taken as needed for pain relief.",The patient was directed to use ice packs and heat therapy.,The patient was advised to cope with the pain without medication.,The patient was provided with nutritional supplements to manage pain.,B,"The discharge summary states that the patient was prescribed Acetaminophen to be taken every six hours and OxycoDONE to be taken every four hours, both as needed for pain relief. This implies that these were the measures taken to control the patient's pain post-discharge. The other options are potential measures that could be taken to control pain, but these were not mentioned in the discharge summary for this particular patient. Therefore, they are incorrect in the context of the question asked."
10,1,14467252,What were the primary symptoms and clinical observations that led to the diagnosis of disseminated Lyme disease in this patient?,"The patient presented with severe chest pains, shortness of breath, racing heart rate, lost of body weight and increased appetite.","The patient exhibited sudden and severe allergic reaction, difficulty in breathing, respiratory failure, decreased blood pressure, drowsiness and fainting.","The patient's main symptoms were unexplained feeling of confusion, severe stuttering, numbness or paralysis on one side of the body, blurred vision and a severe headache.","The patient experienced fevers, palpitations, increased body fatigue, joint pain that traveled, and irregular heart beats leading to lightheadedness.","The symptoms which presented were repeated vomiting, intense abdominal pain, severe dehydration, unusual bowel movements and severe muscular spasms.",D,"From the discharge summary, it was clear that the patient's primary symptoms that led to the diagnosis of Lyme disease were fevers and palpitations which is included in option D. The other symptoms mentioned in option D were also noted in the records, such as joint pain and lightheadedness due to irregular heartbeat. In contrast, none of the other options accurately represented the patient's symptoms. For example, Option A could be distractor for the heart block diagnosis and option C would steer towards neurological disorders. Furthermore, option B and E include symptoms that were not exhibited by the patient, thus making option D the only one that accurately captures this patient's condition."
11,1,10988590,"What were the treatments administered to the patient during this admission, and did he have any relevant past medical history?",The patient was treated with physiotherapy during his stay and he has a history of hypertension.,"This patient was treated with intubation, sedated, received a banana bag, and 10 mg ativan while being admitted for further care in MICU. There is a mention of his prior ablation for ventricular tachycardia and previous admissions for alcohol intoxication.",The patient was treated for heart complications and he has a history of diabetes.,"The patient was kept under observation only, and he has a history of cardiac arrest.",The patient was administered pain medication to manage his discomfort and he has a history of stroke.,B,"The correct answer is B because the patient was in fact sedated, intubated, given a banana bag, and 10 mg ativan, as admitted in MICU for further care. It also mentions that he had a history of prior ablation due to possible catecholamine-induced polymorphic VT and admissions for alcohol intoxication. Other options, A, C, D, and E, do not accurately reflect the treatments administered or his past medical history as mentioned in the discharge summary. These choices all include treatments that were not given or incorrect past medical history, which makes them reasonable distractors."
12,1,16439494,"What is the suspected main cause of the patient's nausea, vomiting, and hiccups that occurred on his last visit and what was the main treatment provided for it?",The patient's issues were suspected to be from an infection; treatment included Thorazine on an IV.,The patient's condition was thought to be a late response to chemotherapy; the treatment provided entailed Zofran.,Disease progression was suspected as the cause of the patient's symptoms; treatment involved Baclofen.,It was suggested that gastroenteritis caused the patient's discomfort; IVF therapy was put in place as a treatment.,Side effects from chemotherapy were believed to have caused the patient's symptoms; the patient was treated with Trazodone.,B,"The correct response is B, as the main cause of the patient's nausea, vomiting, and hiccups was suspected to be delayed reaction to chemotherapy, and the primary treatment provided was Zofran. Choice A is incorrect as, although Thorazine was given in IV form, it wasn't the main treatment for the condition. Option C is not accurate since there is no evidence in the note that disease progression was suspected as the main cause. The cause of the symptoms according to choice D, gastroenteritis, isn't confirmed in the note, and IVF was not the primary treatment. Finally, choice E is incorrect because even though side effects from chemotherapy were considered possible causes, Trazodone was not the main treatment provided for these symptoms."
13,1,17581899,What was the outcome of the patient's Lumbar Puncture and how did it influence the treatment plan?,"The patient's lumbar puncture showed normal results, leading to no changes in the treatment plan.","The lumbar puncture revealed a high number of lymphocytes, indicating a bacterial infection, leading to treatment with strong antibiotics.","Lumbar puncture revealed elevated WBC with lymphocytic predominance, elevated total protein, and normal glucose, suggesting viral meningitis, leading to treatment with acyclovir and IV fluids until HSV PCR from CSF returned negative.","The lumbar puncture presented a low WBC count, suggesting a viral infection, leading to treatment with antiviral medications.","The lumbar puncture exhibited an increase in protein levels, indicating a severe infection, leading to an aggressive antibiotic regime.",C,"The information in the discharge summary indicates that the lumbar puncture showed elevated WBC with lymphocytic predominance, elevated total protein, and normal glucose results (paraphrased in Option C) which are concerned for viral meningitis. As a result, acyclovir and IV fluids were administered until HSV PCR from CSF returned negative. This rules out answers B, D, and E as these options incorrectly described the results of the lumbar puncture. Answer A is incorrect, as changes were made to the treatment plan in response to the results of the lumbar puncture."
14,1,19039032,What could have potentially caused the patient's sinus tachycardia?,The patient had an abnormality in her heart structure causing the rapid heart rate.,The patient had stayed dehydrated for a long duration which might have resulted in sinus tachycardia.,The patient had an electrolyte imbalance that might have led to sinus tachycardia.,The patient had excessive alcohol intake leading to sinus tachycardia.,The patient had thyroid dysfunction resulting in sinus tachycardia.,B,"The correct answer is that her dehydration was likely the cause of her sinus tachycardia as evidenced by her symptoms improving with fluids, as mentioned in the Discharge Instructions. Option A is incorrect as the echocardiogram showed no structural heart abnormalities. Option C is incorrect as her labs were notable for normal electrolytes. Option D is incorrect as the patient denies excessive alcohol intake, and she only had occasional alcoholic beverages. Option E is incorrect as her thyroid functions were tested and found to be normal."
15,1,17108763,What were the main findings from the physical examination of the patient upon admission and what was the conclusion made about those findings?,The physical exam upon admission showed abnormal vaginal discharge and a high fever.,"The patient was found to be in acute distress, with a heart murmur and severely elevated BP.","Mild right lower quadrant tenderness over a palpable mobile 10 cm mass, with no indication of urgent surgical intervention needed.",The physical examination found the patient's heart rate to be irregular and a semi-solid mass in the left ovary.,The physical examination found severe respiratory distress and obstruction.,C,"According to the discharge summary, the physical examination revealed a palpable 10 cm mass in the right lower quadrant of the patient's abdomen, with mild tenderness. However, the pain was stable, and her abdominal exams were stable and reassuring, meaning there was no indication for urgent surgical intervention. Option A is incorrect because the patient had no abnormal vaginal discharge and was afebrile. Option B is wrong because she was not in acute distress, had a regular heart rhythm and normal blood pressure. Option D is incorrect because her heart rate was regular, and the mass was in the right ovary, not the left. Option E is incorrect because she was not in respiratory distress, and there was no mention of any respiratory obstruction. The clues for these options were pulled from various other parts of the note but do not correctly answer the question asked."
16,1,10653041,What were the findings during the patient's EGD and subsequent CT scan on her visit dated 2164-07-14?,The EGD showed signs of inflammation in the stomach while the CT scan revealed the presence of abnormal fluids.,"In the EGD, the presence of a small hiatal hernia, gastritis and atrophic mucosa was detected and the CT scan revealed the existence of air around the distal esophagus and GE junction.","The EGD highlighted the presence of an ulcer in the gastric region, with the CT scan confirming a tumor.","Through the EGD, a pyloric stenosis was identified and the CT scan showed evidence of metastasis.",The EGD disclosed the presence of gastric polyps while the CT scan detected a bladder infection.,B,"The information from the discharge summary reveals that the patient had a successful EGD where they found a small hiatal hernia, gastritis, and atrophic mucosa. Following this, a CT scan was performed that revealed the presence of mediastinal air at the distal esophagus and GE junction. The other options are incorrect because they mention conditions or findings that are not mentioned anywhere in the patient's discharge summary, making them good distractors. For example, options A, C, D, and E mention inflammation, abnormal fluids, an ulcer, a tumor, pyloric stenosis, metastasis, gastric polyps, and a bladder infection. None of these conditions were discovered or mentioned in the patient's discharge summary."
17,1,14815666,"What type of surgery did the patient have during her stay, according to the discharge summary charted on 2189-12-26, and how did she respond postoperative?",The patient underwent a thyroid bypass surgery and recovered without experiencing any pain postoperatively.,"The patient underwent a laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery and postoperatively, she showed signs of tachycardia and decreased saturations, but did pretty well overall.","The patient had laparoscopic appendectomy and postoperatively, developed discomfort and signs of infection.","The patient underwent cholecystectomy and during her recovery, she experienced respiratory issues.",The patient had knee replacement surgery and had a favorable recovery with controlled pain.,B,"The correct answer is B because in the discharge summary, it is clearly mentioned that the patient underwent a laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery and postoperatively, she had signs of tachycardia and desaturations but did pretty well. Answer choice A, C, D, and E are incorrect because the procedures listed either do not match the patient's actual surgery (thyroid bypass, laparoscopic appendectomy, cholecystectomy, knee replacement) or the postoperative response mentioned did not occur (pain-free recovery, discomfort and signs of infection, respiratory issues). Despite using information from the discharge summary, these options do not accurately answer the question."
18,1,15051548,"What was the primary medical condition that the patient was admitted with, what treatment was suggested, and what was their response?","The patient was admitted with Ankle fracures, surgical evaluation and hemi-colectomy were suggested, but the patient refused.","The patient was admitted with GERD, medication with PPI was suggested, but the patient declined.","The patient was admitted with Sigmoid volvulus, surgical treatment and diverting colostomy were suggested, but the patient declined and chose comfort care instead.","The patient was admitted with a gastrointestinal infection, IV fluids and KCL replacement were suggested, and the patient accepted treatment.","The patient was admitted with total hip replacement complications, further surgical intervention was suggested, but the patient refused.",C,"The discharge summary indicates that the patient was admitted primarily with a condition called sigmoid volvulus which is a twist in the sigmoid colon. When surgery was proposed as a treatment option, the patient adamantly refused, instead opting for comfort care. Option A, B, D, and E were part of the patient's medical history or treatment but were not the primary reason for his admission, nor were they the suggested treatments."
19,1,19109010,What is the patient's final diagnosis upon discharge from the hospital?,Anxiety and Depression,Recurrent dental tumor,Syncope,Orthostatic hypotension,Pneumonia,C,"The discharge diagnosis in the summary specifies ""Syncope"" or fainting as the ultimate diagnosis upon leaving the hospital. Although option A ""Anxiety and Depression"" and option B ""Recurrent dental tumor"" are both part of the patient's medical history, they were not the final diagnosis upon discharge. As for option D ""Orthostatic hypotension"", while this can cause syncopal episodes, there is no specific mention in the discharge summary of this diagnosis. Finally, option E ""Pneumonia"" is mentioned as a condition observed during the patient's stay in the hospital, but is not the final diagnosis upon discharge."
20,1,15591142,"What was the patient's past medical history, and the results of the physical exams during admission and discharge, as per records dated 2133-04-24?","The patient's past medical history included a fall from her bed, while physical exams during admission showed CP at 121/55 HR: 86 and on discharge, the patient maintained alertness and followed instructions.","The patient's past medical history showed a traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH), while physical exams presented normal reflexes during admission, and a slightly decreased strength on the Left side from a previous MS condition on discharge.","The patient's past medical history included Multiple Sclerosis (MS), while physical exams during admission presented her as being awake, alert and NAD, with intact speech and strength full, apart from trace weakness in the distal Left lower extremity. On discharge, she was alert and oriented, followed commands, and was at her baseline strength on the Left side.","The patient's past medical history included a heart condition, and the physical exams showed WBC-7.8 during admission and RBC-4.30 at discharge.","The patient's past medical history involved a normal cervical collar, while physical exams during admission showed BP: 121/55 HR: 86 R: 18 O2Sats: 10% and on discharge, muscle weaknesses were detected.",C,"The patient's past medical history, as per the record, includes Multiple Sclerosis (MS) as mentioned under Past Medical History. On admission, the patient was awake, alert, and independent with mostly normal physical conditions apart from a slight weakness in the distal Left lower extremity. Upon discharge, the patient was alert and oriented and exhibited baseline strength on the Left side. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they either incorrectly interpret the patient's past medical history or inaccurately summarize the physical exam findings. For example, option A incorrectly assumes the patient's fall from the bed as her past medical history; B and D misinterpret her past medical history like SAH and heart condition rather than MS. Option E inaccurately states the patient's physical condition on discharge, and option D incorrectly interprets the patient's Blood reports as a physical exam."
21,1,17923359,"What were the drugs detected in the toxicology screen of the patient admitted on 2153-12-30, and what was the advised treatment by the toxicology team?",The toxicology screen detected alcohol and cocaine. The treatment advised was immediate detoxification.,The toxicology screen was positive for heroin and amphetamines. The patient was recommended for drug rehabilitation therapy.,The toxicology screen showed presence of cocaine and opiates. The toxicology team advised a conservative care approach.,The toxicology report suggested presence of marijuana and methamphetamine. The patient was asked to undergo cognitive behavioral therapy.,The toxicology screen detected benzos and ecstasy. The team advised for psychiatric evaluation.,C,"According to the discharge notes, the patient's toxicology screen was positive for cocaine and opiates. The toxicology team suggested a conservative care approach. Options A, B, D, and E mention other substances not detected in the patient or treatments not mentioned in the notes, making them incorrect even though these substances and treatments are generally associated with substance abuse cases."
22,1,13805874,"What was the primary finding contributing to the patient's leg pain as found in the hip MRI, and what was the final discharge diagnosis?",The primary finding contributing to the patient's leg pain as discovered through a hip MRI was a tiny bony fragment adjacent to the superior aspect of the left acetabulum and the final discharge diagnosis was an os acetabuli.,The major discovery regarding the patient's leg pain as seen in the hip MRI was an avulsion fracture and the patient was finally diagnosed with a rectus femoris avulsion fracture.,"The key finding in the hip MRI pertaining to the patient's leg discomfort was mild left greater trochanteric bursitis, and the conclusive discharge diagnosis was L4 radiculopathy and Greater trochanteric bursitis.","The patient's leg pain was majorly attributed to proliferative changes to the anterior aspect of the left femoral neck and subtle acetabular roof marrow edema, as revealed in the hip MRI, and the terminal discharge diagnosis was femoroacetabular impingement.","The hip MRI demonstrated asymptomatic left sciatic nerve issue as the primary reason behind the patient's leg pain, and the final discharge diagnosis was a spinal nerve issue.",C,"The description in the provided note explains that the MRI obtained for the patient's leg pain revealed ""greater trochanteric bursitis"" as a primary finding. Although the other choices contain conditions and discoveries pointed out in the patient's discharge summary, they were either incidental findings or not considered as primary findings for the leg pain. Hence, only option C correctly connects the primary finding from the hip MRI (greater trochanteric bursitis) to the discharge diagnoses given (L4 radiculopathy, greater trochanteric bursitis)."
23,1,11737536,"What is the most likely reason for the patient's syncopal (fainting) episode, according to the discharge summary dated 2141-11-28, and what diagnostic tests or results were utilized to determine the cause?","The patient's fainting episode was probably due to an aneurysm, as indicated by the CT HEAD findings in the report.","The patient's fainting could be owed to a cardiac issue, as implied by the EKG results in the discharge report.","The patient's syncopal condition was likely due to dehydration, as suggested by the lab findings in the summary.","The patient's fainting was most likely due to a vasovagal episode experienced during micturition, based on the hospital course noted in the discharge summary and the results of CTA and EKG tests.","The patient's fainting episode was likely due to a pulmonary embolus, as suggested by the CTA CHEST results in the discharge summary.",D,"Answer D is correct because the 'Hospital Course' section in patient's discharge report indicates a belief that the fainting episode was due to a vasovagal event, which occurred during micturition. The report goes on to note the results of the CTA and EKG tests, both of which ruled out other potential causes like a pulmonary embolus (ruled out by CTA, making answer E incorrect) and an arrhythmia (ruled out by EKG, making answer B incorrect). Answer A is incorrect because the CT HEAD was normal. Answer C is incorrect as there was no indication of dehydration in the patient's lab results, although, the summary mentioned sufficient fluid administration to rule out hypovolemia, suggesting that it initially could have been a cause of fainting."
24,1,10261743,What was the initial suspected cause of the patient's rectal bleeding and was this condition found to persist during the patient's hospital admission?,"The initial suspected cause was a diverticular bleed, and it persisted throughout the patient's hospital stay.","The initial suspected cause was a post-polypectomy bleed, and it did not persist throughout the patient's hospital stay.","The initial suspected cause was lower GI bleed due to Hypercholesterolemia, and it persisted through the patient's hospital admission.","The initial suspected cause was hemorrhoids, and it did not persist throughout the patient's hospital stay.","The initial suspected cause was a result of prostate cancer, and it persisted throughout the hospital stay.",B,"The discharge summary noted that the initial suspected causes of bright red blood seen by the patient were a post-polypectomy bleed or diverticular bleed (option A and B). However, further down in the 'Brief Hospital Course' section, it mentioned that the patient had no further episodes of bleeding on the floor, indicating that the condition did not persist during his hospital stay. This rules out option A, which stated that the diverticular bleed persisted. Options C, D, and E are incorrect because hypercholesterolemia, hemorrhoids, and prostate cancer are not mentioned in the discharge summary as causes for the rectal bleeding. Therefore, the correct answer is B, the initial suspected cause was a post-polypectomy bleed, and it did not persist during the patient's hospital stay."
25,1,12152580,What significant issues were encountered regarding the patient's recovery from the infraclavicular first rib resection procedure?,The patient suffered a pneumothorax post-surgery.,The patient had issues with pain management and required increased dosage of medication.,The patient experienced difficulties with urination post-surgery.,Postoperative wound infection developed in the patient.,There were complications with the actual operation procedures.,C,"From the information given in the discharge summary, the correct answer is C. After the procedure, the patient's Foley was removed and she was unable to void, necessitating catheterization the following morning. In contrast, according to the notes, the patient did not suffer from a pneumothorax post-surgery (option A), and there is no evidence that there were issues with pain management (option B). Meanwhile, there was no mention of wound infection in the discharge summary (option D). Finally, there were no reports of issues with the operation procedures (option E). Hence, these options serve as suitable distractors for they mentioned some possible complications seen post-procedure."
26,1,16468426,What was the patient's past medical history and what type of abscess was found during the physical examination?,The patient has a history of hypertension and the abscess found was a pulmonary abscess.,"The patient has a history of Type I Diabetes Mellitus, poorly controlled, and was found to have a perianal abscess during the physical examination.",The patient's past medical history includes Coronary Artery Disease and the abscess located was cardiac.,The patient was previously diagnosed with Type II Diabetes Mellitus and a cerebral abscess was found.,Previous history of Heart Failure and the physical examination revealed a renal abscess.,B,"The patient's past medical history, as indicated in the discharge summary, includes Type I Diabetes Mellitus that is not well-controlled. In the physical examination, a perianal abscess was found, which is present near or around the anus. The other options, while they contain conditions and findings mentioned in the discharge summary, do not correctly answer the question. The patient does not have a history of hypertension, Coronary Artery Disease, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, or Heart Failure as their primary illness nor were any pulmonary, cardiac, cerebral or renal abscesses discovered during the physical examination."
27,1,12325171,What changes were made to the patient's medication regimen following the nasal septoplasty and open rhinoplasty?,The patient was switched from oral pain medications to Morphine PCA.,Fluticasone was stopped to prevent nasal obstruction.,The patient was put on a regimen of IV clindamycin transitioning to oral dosage for discharge.,Lisinopril was raised to a higher dosage post-surgery.,The patient was given Azithromycin despite her allergy to manage infection post-surgery.,C,"After the nasal septoplasty and open rhinoplasty, the patient's medication was changed to include Clindamycin, which was initially given intravenously then switched to oral form for discharge home. Answer A is incorrect because the patient was not switched from oral pain medications to Morphine PCA, instead, it was the other way around. Answer B is incorrect; there was no indication in the discharge summary that the patient stopped using Fluticasone. Answer D is not correct because Lisinopril remained at the same 10mg dosage. Answer E is also not correct as the summary expressly states that she has an allergy to Azithromycin."
28,1,10934974,"What were the preoperative conditions of the right and left ventricles of the heart, and how did they change after the patient underwent the Atrial Septal Defect Repair surgery?","The right ventricle was moderately dilated and the left ventricle was mildly hypertrophic preoperatively. After the surgery, both ventricles showed no significant change.","Both ventricles were in good condition preoperatively, and the conditions remained stable after the surgery.","The right ventricle was mildly dilated and left ventricle was moderately hypertrophic preoperatively. After the surgery, both ventricles returned to a normal condition.","The left ventricle was slightly enlarged with a blood clot preoperatively. After surgery, the clot was removed and the left ventricle returned to a normal size.","Both ventricles were in a critical condition preoperatively. After the surgery, the conditions worsened further.",A,"As per the discharge summary, the preoperative condition of the right ventricular was dilated to a moderate degree and that of the left ventricle was mildly hypertrophic. After the surgery, it is mentioned that the right ventricle remained markedly dilated and the left ventricle showed mild hypokinesis without evidence of regional wall abnormalities. This suggests that there were no significant changes in the conditions of both ventricles after the surgery. The other choices provide inaccurate information or exaggerate the conditions of the ventricles which is not described in the discharge summary."
29,1,18773933,What was the primary medical concern of the patient as per the admission on 2181-02-11 and what major surgical procedure was performed to address this concern?,"The main health problem was hypertension, and the primary surgical intervention was a sphincterotomy.","Sulfa allergy was the principal concern, and a transurethral resection was conducted to address it.",Chief complaint was jaundice; an ERCP procedure performed to deal with it.,"Diabetes was the primary health issue, as per the medical history, and cataract operation was conducted to address it.",The chief medical issue was bladder cancer with a surgery related to a diaphragmatic hernia performed to deal with it.,C,"The primary concern of the patient as per the admission on 2181-02-11 was jaundice. This is shown in the 'Chief Complaint' section which states that the patient's main issue was jaundice. The major surgical procedure performed to address this concern was the ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography), which can be gleaned from the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section. The other options mention either conditions or procedures that feature in the patient's medical history, but they are either chronic issues or procedures that took place in the past, not being related to this particular visit."
30,1,15478220,What was the main concern for the headache experienced by the patient and what measures were recommended by the rheumatology consultant for the same?,The primary concern was temporal arteritis with initial management being levothyroxine administration.,The main issue was Herpes ophthalmicus and it was recommended to take Acetaminophen as necessary.,"The key concern was trigeminal neuralgia and to manage it, Atorvastatin was prescribed.",The principal worry was temporal arteritis and she was recommended to commence prednisone medication and undergo a temporal artery biopsy.,The central problem was Trigeminal neuralgia and the treatment included taking Oxycodone as needed for pain management.,D,"The main problem associated with the patient's headache was diagnosed as Temporal Arteritis. The management advised by the Rheumatologist was to start on a regimen of Prednisone 60mg daily and to schedule an outpatient biopsy procedure with vascular surgery to confirm temporal arteritis. Options A, B, C and E are incorrect as while Levothyroxine, Acetaminophen, Atorvastatin and Oxycodone were part of the overall medical management, it was not specifically in relation to the temporal arteritis or headache. Furthermore, Herpes ophthalmicus and Trigeminal neuralgia, were considered as potential etiologies but were not confirmed."
31,1,13116047,What type of surgery was performed on the patient during their hospital stay and what was the reason for this procedure?,The patient underwent a kidney transplant due to a periprosthetic femur fracture.,The patient underwent a periprosthetic hip operatively managed with internal fixation (ORIF) using a distal femoral plate to rectify a periprosthetic femur fracture.,The patient underwent a heart bypass surgery due to hypertension.,Orthopaedic surgery was performed due to back pain.,The patient underwent a spinal operation due to the inability to walk.,B,"In the ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure"" section, it is stated that the patient underwent a ""R femur periprosthetic hip ORIF (Distal Femoral plate)"" surgery. This shows that the patient had undergone a periprosthetic hip operation that was treated with internal fixation using a distal femoral plate.   Option A is incorrect as while the surgery was due to periprosthetic femur fracture, the procedure was not a kidney transplant. Option C is incorrect as there is no mention of heart bypass surgery or hypertension. Option D is again wrong. Even though the patient has a past medical history of back pain, there is no record of orthopaedic surgery for back pain during this admission. Lastly, option E is not correct as the surgery performed was not a spinal operation and inability to walk was a symptom following an accident, not the reason for surgery."
32,1,18303187,What was the primary cause of the patient's lower leg swelling and how was it treated during his hospital stay?,The patient's lower leg swelling was caused by hepatic cirrhosis and was treated with intravenous fluids.,"The patient's lower leg swelling was due to a thrombus in the leg, which was treated with anticoagulants.","The lower leg swelling was the result of heart failure, which was treated with cardiac medications.","The patient's lower leg swelling was due to a urinary retention caused by enlarged prostate, which was treated with a urinary catheter and the medication Tamsulosin.","The lower leg swelling was the result of a lymphedema, which was treated with manual lymphatic drainage.",D,"From the discharge summary, the primary cause of the patient's lower leg swelling was urinary retention due to an enlarged prostate (BPH). This caused a mechanical obstruction, leading to edema in the lower extremities. The condition was treated by inserting a Foley catheter to drain the urine and prescribing Tamsulosin to help relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder, improving urine flow. The other options distract from the correct answer by suggesting other potential causes of leg swelling (hepatic cirrhosis, lower extremity thrombus, heart failure, lymphedema) which are not supported by the patient's presentation or hospital course outlined within the discharge summary."
33,1,11016141,What steps were taken for patient's diet adjustments to relieve the persistent severe pain due to ERCP and how does it help in treating the condition?,Patient had an ERCP with sphincterotomy which helped in feeding and provided pain relief.,Patient was placed on tube feeds to provide nutrition and rest to the pancreas.,Patient was kept on glycemic diets to regulate blood sugar and ease abdominal pain.,Patient was placed on intravenous therapy to get required nutrition.,"Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were administered, helping patient in pain relief and introducing nutritious diet.",B,The discharge summary mentions that the patient with a history of ERCP due to persistent severe pain had an NJ tube placed endoscopically and she was placed on tube feeds. This adjustment in the patient's diet was made to provide her with required nutrition while allowing her pancreas to rest. This would help in alleviating the pain and aiding the recovery process of pancreatitis. Other options are mentioned in the summary but those are related to different aspects of the patient's treatment and not specifically about dietary adjustments to relieve pain due to ERCP.
34,1,16339307,What was the nature of the patient's complaint upon admission and what treatment was provided during her hospital stay?,The patient was admitted due to a random allergic reaction and was treated with antihistamines.,The patient was admitted due to heart disease and was treated with appropriate cardiac medication.,The patient was admitted with a complaint of migratory abdominal pain and was treated with a laparoscopic appendectomy followed by pain management medication.,The patient was admitted due to a fractured arm and was treated with a cast application.,The patient was admitted due to headache and was treated with aspirin.,C,"Upon admission, the patient's major complaint was migratory abdominal pain as mentioned in the 'Chief Complaint' section of the discharge summary. During her stay at the hospital, she underwent laparoscopic appendectomy which is specified in the 'Major surgical or invasive procedure' and 'Brief Hospital Course' sections of the summary. Pain management medication and further home care instructions were prescribed at the discharge to provide continued relief and care after the operation as mentioned in the 'Discharge Instructions' section.  Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect and serve as good distractors because they mentioned conditions and treatments that are not found anywhere in the patient's discharge summary."
35,1,16833149,"What is the medication regimen that was recommended for the patient at the time of discharge, and what are they supposed to address?","Cipro 500 mg twice a day, Flagyl 500 mg three times a day, Mercaptopurine 50 mg at bedtime, and Mesalamine 250 mg twice a day to manage Crohn's disease flare-up.","Cipro 500 mg twice daily, Flagyl 500 mg 3 times daily, Mercaptopurine 1.5 tablets once daily, Mesalamine 4 capsules daily, to treat enterocutaneous fistula.","Flagyl 500 mg three times a day, Mercaptopurine 50 mg each night, and Mesalamine 250 mg twice a day to control abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.","Mercaptopurine 50 mg at bedtime, Mesalamine 250 mg twice a day, Calcium 600 and Vitamin D3 (1 tablet twice daily), and Multivitamins to maintain patient's overall health status.","Cipro 500 mg twice a day, Flagyl 500 mg three times a day, Mercaptopurine 50 mg at bedtime to treat acute Crohn's disease, and Mesalamine 250 mg twice a day for osteopenia.",A,"The question asks for the medication regimen at discharge and what they are meant to address. All medications listed under 'Discharge Medications' in the patient's discharge summary indicate that they address the patient’s acute Crohn’s disease flare-up. As such, A is correct. Options B, C, D, and E contain distractors that include treatment for other conditions mentioned in the patient's history, but these were not the primary reason for the recommended medication regimen at discharge."
36,1,14210681,What were the discharge instructions given to this patient after her laparoscopic appendectomy on her last visit?,The patient was advised to continue on her regular home medications and take new medications as prescribed.,The patient was asked to lift heavy items over a certain weight limit for six weeks post surgery.,The patient was informed to continue abdominal exercises immediately after the surgery.,The patient was told to bathe with a tub and go swimming after the surgery.,She was instructed to ignore any symptoms of discomfort or change and not to contact a doctor unless symptoms worsen severely.,A,"The discharge instructions which include precautions with certain activities, indications to seek medical help, and medication instructions make Option A the correct answer. Option B contradicts the note that specifically mentions the patient was told not to engage in heavy lifting for six weeks. Option C also contradicts the note as the patient was told not to do any abdominal exercises. Option D is incorrect as the patient was specifically advised against tub baths or swimming. Option E is incorrect as the note provided specific situations when the patient should contact a doctor, not when symptoms worsen severely only."
37,1,16372346,What was the patient’s diagnosis and what major surgical procedure was performed during her hospitalization as per the discharge summary dated 2146-04-26?,The patient was diagnosed with gastritis and underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy.,The patient was diagnosed with cholecystitis and underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,The patient was diagnosed with h/o Molar Pregnancy and underwent a D+C for incomplete abortion.,The patient was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia and was treated with intravenous iron therapy.,The patient was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and was started on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.,B,"The discharge summary provides that the patient was diagnosed with cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) as indicated under the 'Discharge Diagnosis' section. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a minimally invasive surgery to remove the gallbladder, which is mentioned under the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section.   Option A is incorrect because the patient was not diagnosed with gastritis for this hospitalization or underwent an appendectomy according to the discharge summary. Option C is incorrect because D+C for incomplete abortion belongs to the patient's past medical history and not related to this hospitalization. Option D is incorrect because even though the patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, she was hospitalized due to cholecystitis in this instance and no intervention related to anemia is mentioned. Option E is incorrect as the patient did not receive any treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism during this hospitalization. It is mentioned in the past medical history."
38,1,12498730,What is the size of the kidney stone detected in the patient during the admission on 2111-07-28 in urology service?,The patient's kidney stone measured about 12mm in diameter.,The kidney stone was approximately 15mm in size.,The size of the kidney stone was around 9mm.,The kidney stone detected was about 5mm in size.,The patient had a kidney stone about 8mm in size.,C,"The discharge note states that the patient had a kidney stone that was ""9mm in size"". This makes option C the correct answer. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they mention sizes that aren't stated in the discharge note, hence they are good distractors."
39,1,17500024,What medication changes were made to the patient's blood pressure management during this hospital visit?,The patient stopped taking labetalol and started taking captopril.,The patient was prescribed lisinopril instead of labetalol.,"The patient was started on atenolol and hydrALAzine and stopped taking labetalol, captopril, and nifedipine.",The patient's dosage of captopril was increased.,The patient's dosage of labetalol was decreased.,C,"In the notes, it is stated that although the patient was prescribed labetalol 200mg BID, captopril 25mg BID, and nifedipine 60mg BID, he was not taking them consistently. During his hospital stay, his medication regime was changed and he was prescribed atenolol 50mg daily and hydrALAzine 25 mg three times daily on discharge. This eliminates options A, B, D, and E because these options mention incorrect medication changes. These options are good distractors, as they all involve the medications the patient was previously taking or received in the hospital. The details about the medications he was taking before and upon discharge were both true, which would make it challenging for someone to identify the correct answer if they weren't careful."
40,1,13465216,What was the primary cause for the patient's hospital admission and what specific treatment was performed?,The patient was admitted for chest pain and underwent a heart valve replacement.,The patient was admitted for managing his migraine headaches and received medication adjustment.,The patient was admitted due to severe chest pain and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting.,The patient was admitted for symptoms of depression and was treated with medication adjustments for the same.,The patient was admitted because of severe dyspnea and received a lung transplant operation.,C,"The patient was admitted to the hospital because of chest pain related to severe coronary artery disease. The predominant treatment administered was a coronary artery bypass grafting (specifically x1 left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery). Answer choice 'C' aligns precisely with these details. Other answer choices, although based on information found in the discharge summary (the patient's history of migraines, depression, dyspnea during physical exertion), do not correspond to the main reason for hospital admission or the specific treatment performed."
41,1,10694053,What subcapsular injury did the patient sustain from his mechanical fall and how was it managed during their hospital stay?,The patient broke his right rib and it was managed by bandaging the area tightly.,The patient suffered from a subcapsular kidney hematoma which was managed by constant kidney flushing.,The patient had a subcapsular spleen injury managed with a series of prescribed antibiotics.,"This patient had a small subcapsular liver hematoma, managed by following chest tube output and performing serial abdominal exams.","The patient had a subcapsular heart injury, managed through a series of minor surgeries.",D,"The note indicates that the patient suffered from a small subcapsular liver hematoma due to his mechanical fall. This was managed by monitoring chest tube output and doing serial abdominal exams.   Answer A is incorrect because although the patient broke his right rib, there is no indication of bandaging the area in the note.   Answer B is incorrect because the note does not mention any subcapsular kidney hematoma or kidney flushing.   Answer C is incorrect because the note does not mention any subcapsular spleen injury or a series of prescribed antibiotics management.   Answer E is incorrect because it does not mention any subcapsular heart injury or a series of minor surgeries for its management."
42,1,17734674,"What was the cause of the patient's right radial head and neck fracture, and what was the resulting surgical intervention?",The patient fell off a ladder at work and underwent radial head removal.,"The patient was struck by a car while riding a bike, leading to a radial head replacement.","The patient experienced severe elbow pain resulting from old age, which required invasive surgery to relieve the pain.",The patient was in a car crash and had a full arm amputation.,"The patient fell while hiking, which resulted in a broken nose, but no elbow surgery was performed.",B,"As per the discharge summary, the patient was riding a bike and was struck by an oncoming car, which caused a right radial head and neck fracture. Consequently, the patient had a radial head replacement surgery. Option B is the correct answer as it captured all these points correctly. Option A is incorrect as there was no mention of a fall from a ladder at work in the patient's history. Option C is incorrect because there is no evidence of the elbow pain being a result of ageing or any invasive surgery. Option D is incorrect as there is no record of a car crash or a full arm amputation. Option E is incorrect because although the patient did suffer a broken nose along with the radial head and neck fracture, the note clearly mentions an elbow surgery whereas this option denies it."
43,1,19156490,"What were the abnormalities observed in the patient's CT scans during her hospital stay, and what implications might these have for her treatment and recovery?",The CT scans showed that she had a fracture in her right clavicle and mild pancreatitis.,"The CT examinations revealed an appendix condition, pneumobilia related to a previous cholecystectomy, and minor intrahepatic biliary duct dilation.","The CT scans exposed the patient had subarachnoid hemorrhage in her brain's right frontal lobe and a fracture in her occipital bone. Possible complications relate to her central nervous system, which might need follow-up imaging and rehabilitation.",The CT scans detected the patient having pancolonic diverticulosis and an enlarged appendix.,Results from the CT examinations depicted that she indeed had multiple bilateral renal hypodensities and calcified pleural plaques.,C,"The patient's CT scans, as reflecting in the notes, showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage in her right frontal lobe and a fracture in her right occipital bone (paraphrased for C). The other CT scan findings were accurate and discussed in the discharge summary but did not address the question about abnormalities found in her scans during her hospital stay and the implications for her recovery and treatment. For example; The patient's appendix was normal (basis for distractor B and D), and the pneumbilia and biliary duct dilation were likely related to earlier cholecystectomy (a basis for distractor B). Laceration near the occiput or past medical history of cholecystectomy doesn't have any direct impact on the current hospital stay and recovery (basis for distractor A); renal hypodensities and calcified pleural plaques were mentioned in the CT results but irrelevant to the primary treatment and recovery of the patient (basis for distractor E). This makes C the correct answer."
44,1,11674668,What was the surgical procedure undergone by the patient in his past visit and what was the outcome post-operatively?,The patient underwent a coronary bypass surgery and had no post-operative complications.,The patient underwent a splenectomy and suffered from post-operative complications.,The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy and recovered without any complications post-operatively.,The patient underwent a kidney transplant and was discharged in stable condition.,The patient underwent prostate surgery and was put on medication subsequently.,C,"The discharge summary mentions that the patient underwent a ""laparoscopic appendectomy"". The summary also indicates that the post-operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged in stable condition, therefore the answer is C. The other options are incorrect as the patient didn't undergo any of those procedures mentioned in them, but they are good distractors as they relate to surgical procedures that could be inferred from the general medical context."
45,1,16482924,What was the medical procedure given to the patient following his report of abdominal/left shoulder pain due to an incident in jail and what vaccinations were administered during his hospital stay?,The patient underwent a hysterectomy and he received influenza and measles vaccines.,"The patient underwent an appendectomy and he received polio, and mumps vaccines.","The patient underwent a splenectomy and he received Pneumovax, haemophilus B and menigococcus vaccines.","The patient underwent a tonsillectomy and he received hepatitis B, and rabies vaccines.","The patient underwent a gastric bypass and he received tetanus, and hepatitis C vaccines.",C,"According to the provided discharge summary, the patient had a splenectomy after presenting with abdominal/left shoulder pain related to an incident in jail. During his stay at the hospital, he received Pneumovax, haemophilus B and menigococcus vaccines. Choices A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they do not accurately represent the procedure or the vaccinations received by the patient during his hospital stay based on the details in the discharge summary. These options serve as good distractors because they represent possible procedures and vaccinations that could happen in a similar patient case, but they are not correct in this specific case."
46,1,13355740,"What were the signs and symptoms, major findings and the treatment given for the patient's splenic injury?","The patient felt pain in her left lower quadrant and shoulder after a colonoscopy. The CT scan revealed a significant amount of fluid around her spleen and an accumulation of blood along her spleen and in the pelvis. Treatment included intake of intravenous fluids, regular abdominal examinations, and completion of a course of antibiotics.","The patient experienced chest pains, along with severe coughing and shake chills. A CT scan showed a possible rupture at the spleen. The patient was administered intravenous fluids and subjected to multiple cardiac tests. C: The patient presented intense nausea, vomiting and high fever. The CT scan showed an unspecified lung infection. The treatment plan included antibiotics and respiratory therapies.","The patient presented intense nausea, vomiting and high fever. The CT scan showed an unspecified lung infection. The treatment plan included antibiotics and respiratory therapies.",The patient complained about shoulder and right upper quadrant pain. A CT scan showed possible kidney injury. The patient was kept under hydration and regular renal functions were checked.,The patient had frequent episodes of lightheadedness and dizziness. The CT scan revealed a brain injury. The patient was given medications to maintain cerebral health and prevent further complications.,A,"The correct answer is based on the patient's reported symptoms and major findings which included left upper quadrant and shoulder pain after a colonoscopy, along with the CT findings that showed fluid around the spleen and blood along the spleen and in the pelvis, that was indicative of a splenic injury. The patient was managed with maintaining NPO (nil per os, fasting), intravenous hydration, regular abdominal examinations and antibiotic treatment. Other options are incorrect as B mentions chest pains, coughing and chills which were not reported, C includes nausea, vomiting and fever which weren't either present, D relates to kidney injury which wasn't diagnosed, and E is incorrect as it mentions a condition related to the brain while question is aiming at splenic injury."
47,1,12781031,"Based on the patient's past medical history and discharge summary, what were the symptoms the patient presented at the hospital and what was the final cause of the patient's death?",The patient presented with chest pains and ultimately died from a heart attack.,"The patient presented with fever and cough, and their death was due to severe infection.","The patient, who had a history of pulmonary hypertension and cirrhosis, had been experiencing shortness of breath and dyspnea, which progressed from exertional to rest dyspnea. The final cause of the patient's death was hypoxic respiratory failure.",The patient arrived at the hospital with severe abdominal pain and eventually succumbed to liver failure.,The patient showed symptoms of dizziness and eventually passed away due to stroke.,C,"The correct answer is C because as per the discharge summary, the patient had a history of pulmonary hypertension and cirrhosis and had been experiencing shortness of breath and dyspnea. Their condition escalated, leading to respiratory failure due to severe hypoxia, which was the cause of their death. The other answer choices, A, B, D, and E, are not correct as they propose other symptoms and causes of death that are not supported by the information in the discharge summary. Nevertheless, they are plausible distractors because all the conditions mentioned are part of medical disorders that could lead to death."
48,1,18934223,"What specific type of fractures did the patient sustain during her fall, and what were the recommendations from the consulted specialists?",Suffered a left knee fracture and ophthalmology strongly recommended surgery.,Had a hip fracture; specialist advised follow-up check in two weeks.,"Incurred fractures in the left orbital roof and floor, and a minimally displaced left triquetral fracture; specialists recommended follow-up appointments with ophthalmology and plastic surgery, as well as an evaluation by the Hand clinic.",Suffered from a right hand fracture; referred for urgent surgery.,Had a spine fracture ; was instructed to rest in bed until recovered.,C,"The patient indeed suffered from fractures in the left orbital roof and floor, as well as a minimally displaced left triquetral fracture. Answer C is the corrected choice as the discharge summary specifically mentions these fractures and the necessity for follow-up appointments with ophthalmology and plastic surgery, as well as an evaluation by the Hand clinic. The other choices are wrong as they mention fractures and consultations never mentioned in the discharge summary, such as a hip fracture (B, incorrect), spine fracture (E, incorrect), a right hand fracture (D, inaccurate, they mention pain, but X-ray results show no fracture), and a left knee fracture (A, not mentioned as there’s only mention of a scrape on left knee but no fracture)."
49,1,12830332,What was the cause of the patient's pancreatitis as per the discharge summary and what was the recommended treatment plan decided upon discharge?,The patient's pancreatitis was caused by gastritis and was treated using continuous prophylactic antibiotics.,The patient's pancreatitis was caused by obesity and was managed by dietary recommendations and lifestyle changes.,The patient's pancreatitis was triggered by an allergic reaction and was managed using antihistamines.,The patient's pancreatitis was due to gallstones and the treatment plan was antibiotics for 7 days and subsequent outpatient cholecystectomy.,The patient's pancreatitis was associated with excessive alcohol consumption and was managed by promoting alcohol abstinence,D,"The discharge summary mentions that patient's pancreatitis was likely due to gallstones. The patient underwent ERCP for the removal of biliary stones and was treated with antibiotics for a possible biliary infection. It is also mentioned that a cholecystectomy procedure was recommended on an outpatient basis. As such, choice D is correct. Choice A, B, C, and E are included details from the discharge summary (possible gastritis, morbid obesity, allergic rhinitis, sushi & alcohol) but they are not the cause of the pancreatitis nor the actual treatment plan. The correct cause and treatment for pancreatitis are mentioned in Choice D in the Brief Hospital Course section. Therefore, other options become good distractors as they discuss other aspects of the patient's medical history or incorrect presumptions about the cause of pancreatitis."
50,1,11615593,What was the patient's medication at the time of admission and how was it changed during her hospital stay?,"The patient was initially on Zoloft 50mg and Nuvaring. After the patient didn't respond well to Zoloft, it was switched to Wellbutrin 150mg XR.","The patient was on Wellbutrin 150mg XR and Nuvaring on admission. During hospital stay, she was taken off Wellbutrin and instead prescribed Sertraline 50mg which she tolerated well.","During admission, the patient was taking Prozac for her depression. After receiving medical attention, she was discharged with Wellbutrin 150mg XR and Nuvaring.",The patient was only on Nuvaring during admission. The hospital then added the antianxiety medication Zoloft at discharge.,"The patient was on a daily dose of Wellbutrin 150mg XR and Nuvaring upon admission. At the end of her hospital stay, there was no change in her medication.",B,"The discharge summary states that at the time of admission, the patient was taking Wellbutrin 150mg XR daily and Nuvaring. The dosage and type of medication were then altered during her hospital stay upon her report that Wellbutrin wasn't helping her. She was subsequently prescribed Zoloft 50mg which she tolerated well. Other options are incorrect: A is wrong because Zoloft was introduced, not discontinued during the stay. C is wrong because Prozac is not mentioned as the medication during admission. D is wrong because only Nuvaring as an admission medication is mentioned, ignoring Wellbutrin. E is not correct because there was a significant change done to her medication during her stay."
51,1,18445226,"What type of infection did the patient have previously based on her obstetrical and gynecological history, and what were the surgical and medical treatments undertaken during her hospital stay?","The patient had a history of varicella infection, and was admitted for obstetrical complications resolved with a vaginal delivery.","The patient had a history of Rubella infection, treated with acyclovir during her hospital stay.","The patient had a history of fibroids and cysts, and had a hysterectomy during her hospital stay.","The patient had a history of Chlamydia, and was treated with cesarean section and prescription medications like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and oxycodone during her hospital stay.","The patient had a history of Hepatitis B, and underwent a cesarean section during her hospital stay.",D,"Considering the patient's obstetrical and gynecological history, it is evident that she had a previous Chlamydia infection as specified in the notes. Her treatments during her stay at the hospital involved having a cesarean section for delivering her baby in light of the intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and breech presentation issues. She was also given medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain, demonstrating that she had undergone a significant surgical procedure. Choice A is incorrect as the patient did not face any major obstetrical complications that were resolved with a mere vaginal delivery. Similarly, choices B and E are also incorrect because the patient didn't have any history of Rubella or Hepatitis B. On the other hand, option C is incorrect as no history of fibroids or cysts, or treatments like hysterectomy were mentioned in the patient's case summary."
52,1,10010066,What surgical procedures were performed on the patient and how did he respond?,The patient underwent several sessions of general physiotherapy for his foot alongside medication treatment.,"A laparotomy was performed, and the patient managed to recover well.","The patient had an Incision & Drainage (I&D) along with the Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) placement and change, followed by Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF), and a Split-Thickness Skin Graft to the wound for his right open calcaneus fracture, all of which he tolerated well.",The patient was treated with antiviral drugs due to a viral infection.,The patient underwent a minor surgery to the foot because of a laceration.,C,"The patient underwent repeated I&D procedures with VAC placement and changes, followed by an ORIF for the right calcaneal fracture with a Split-Thickness Skin Graft to his wound. The patient tolerated these procedures well and recovered well on the floor post-operations. This is mentioned in the discharge summary under the major surgical procedures and brief hospital course. Remaining choices A, B, D, and E are distractors derived from unrelated or inferred information in the notes. None of the other options mention the specific procedures that the patient underwent, making them incorrect answers."
53,1,18612306,"What was the patient's main presenting complaint during her hospital admission on 2180-12-07, and what was the surgical procedure performed in response?",The patient presented for hospital admission due to complaints of dysmenorrhea and received a procedure to alleviate the symptoms.,"The patient was admitted in the hospital presenting alopecia areata, and she underwent a hair transplant surgery.","The patient was admitted due to myasthenia, diagnosed with thymic hyperplasia, and as a result, underwent a left robotic-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy.",The patient presented to the hospital with complaints of iron deficiency anemia and received a blood transfusion.,"The patient was hospitalized for an Abnormal CT of the chest, and she underwent pleural tap procedure.",C,"The patient's main complaint during her hospital admission was myasthenia, a long-term neuromuscular disease, and thymic hyperplasia was found in her. In response to her condition, the hospital conducted a left robotic-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the thymus gland. Other options are incorrect as they do not match the chief complaint and surgical procedure mentioned in the discharge summary. Although these options provide other aspects of the patient's medical history or potential treatments, they are not relevant to the question asked."
54,1,19796205,What complications did the patient experience postoperatively following the right colectomy at an outside hospital?,The patient developed bowel inflammation and excessive bleeding.,The patient developed skin erosions and a troponin leak.,The patient had a disease flare-up of a pre-existing condition.,The patient experienced a cardiac arrest post-operation.,The patient showed signs of mental instability and depression.,B,"The correct answer is B: the patient developed skin erosions and a troponin leak postoperatively after a right colectomy at an outside hospital, as mentioned in the discharge summary. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect. Option A is misleading as there's no mention of bowel inflammation or excessive bleeding. Option C is also incorrect as there's no mention of a flare-up of a pre-existing condition. Option D is incorrect because there's no mention of a cardiac arrest, and option E is deceptive because no mental instability or depression was reported. The incorrect options are plausible complications post a major operation like a colectomy, making them good distractors."
55,1,16425108,"What procedure did the patient undergo to relieve his lumbar spondylosis, and how was his condition upon discharge?","The patient went through an anterior and posterior decompression with fusion for lumbar spondylosis, and was discharged while still needing a foley catheter for voiding.",The patient went through an anterior and posterior decompression with fusion and was discharged while having support from the lumbar corset brace.,"The patient underwent lumbar exploration with the removal of hardware at L5-S1 for his lumbar spondylosis, and was discharged without any complications.",The patient went through the removal of instrumentation for lumbar spondylosis and was discharged in a foley catheter status.,The patient underwent a spinal fusion surgery and was discharged with a regular diet and medications to manage pain.,C,"The discharge summary states clearly that the patient underwent a ""lumbar exploration with removal of hardware at L5-S1"" and upon discharge, the patient was in a good condition without any complications. Answer choice A is incorrect because the discharge summary states that the patient was voiding well without the need for a foley catheter upon discharge. Answer choice B incorrectly states that patient was discharged needing a lumbar corset brace when in fact the brace was used for support during the hospital stay and it doesn't mention anything about it during the discharge. Answer choice D is incorrect because the summary specifies that the patient underwent exploration and removal of hardware, not the removal of instrumentation. Answer choice E is misleading because though the discharge summary does mention that the patient was discharged with a regular diet and pain medications, it doesn't state that a spinal fusion surgery was performed."
56,1,13497545,What were the discharge medications prescribed to the patient and what is the duration for the Enoxaparin Sodium?,"Ibuprofen, Lisinopril, Methimazole, Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, OxycoDONE, and Enoxaparin Sodium for 1 month.","Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Enoxaparin Sodium, Senna, OxycoDONE, Ferrous Sulfate, with Enoxaparin Sodium lasting 3 weeks.","Lisinopril, Methimazole, Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Enoxaparin Sodium, Senna, OxycoDONE, Ferrous Sulfate, with Enoxaparin Sodium lasting 4 weeks.","Methimazole, Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Enoxaparin Sodium, Senna, OxycoDONE, Ferrous Sulfate, with Enoxaparin Sodium lasting 6 weeks.","Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Enoxaparin Sodium, Senna, OxycoDONE, Ferrous Sulfate, with Enoxaparin Sodium lasting 2 weeks.",C,"Upon review of the discharge summary, it is clear that the medications provided at discharge were indeed Lisinopril, Methimazole, Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Enoxaparin Sodium, Senna, OxycoDONE, and Ferrous Sulfate. Furthermore, the duration for the Enoxaparin Sodium was slated to last four weeks. The remaining answer choices had incorrect medicine combinations or the incorrect duration for Enoxaparin Sodium which makes them good distractors."
57,1,10029468,"What were the surgical history/precedent surgical procedures of the patient who was admitted on 2169-01-16 and has allergies to numerous things including Amoxicillin, iodinated contrast media, lupron among others?",The patient has not undergone any surgical procedures.,"The patient has had Anterior Fusion of the cervical spine, Bilateral Salpingoophorectomy, C section, L tendon repair, and an Occipital nerve stimulator placed.",The patient had a major surgical procedure during the latest admission.,"The patient has undergone only one surgical procedure, the placement of an Occipital nerve stimulator.","The patient has had Anterior Fusion of the cervical spine, Bilateral Salpingoophorectomy, and L tendon repair, but no C section nor Occipital nerve stimulator placement.",B,"The correct answer is B, as per the discharge summary under Past Medical History, the patient has had various surgical procedures such as Anterior Fusion of the cervical spine, Bilateral Salpingoophorectomy, C section, L tendon repair, and an Occipital nerve stimulator placed. Option A is incorrect as the patient has had multiple surgical procedures in the past. Option C is incorrect as it was mentioned in the summary that the patient had no major surgical or invasive procedures during the latest hospital stay. Option D and E incorrectly point out the surgical history of the patient by missing or adding some procedures."
58,1,11527327,What was the immediate treatment provided to manage the patient's syncope during her admission on 2141-01-18?,The patient was given Loperamide 2 mg Capsule.,The patient was administered Lisinopril 20 mg Tablet.,The patient underwent a procedure to place a pacemaker.,The patient was prescribed Levothyroxine 100 mcg Tablet.,The patient was given Aspirin 81 mg Tablet.,C,"The discharge summary mentioned that the patient was suffering from syncope and it was documented that she had a 7-second pause on telemetry after being admitted to the floor. It was discovered that she had sick sinus syndrome which required the treatment of pacemaker placement. This indicates that the immediate treatment provided to manage her syncope was the placement of a pacemaker (option C). Meanwhile, options A, B, D, and E which were Loperamide 2 mg Capsule, Lisinopril 20 mg Tablet, Levothyroxine 100 mcg Tablet, and Aspirin 81 mg Tablet respectively were listed as the patient's discharge medications, but not as part of the immediate syncope treatment provided on her admission date."
59,1,10459962,"What type of fracture was diagnosed in the patient and which side of the face was it situated, according to the discharge summary dated 2115-09-18?",A displaced fracture on the right side of the maxilla.,A fracture in the maxillary wall on the right side.,A nondisplaced fracture in the alveolar process of the maxilla on the left side.,A fracture situated on the right maxillary sinus.,A nondisplaced fracture on the right side of the maxilla.,C,"The discharge summary states that the patient had a nondisplaced fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla located to the left of midline. Therefore, Option C is correct.   Option A is incorrect because the summary does not mention a displaced fracture. Option B is incorrect because while a right maxillary wall opacification is noted, it is specifically stated that no wall fracture is present. Option D and E are wrong because no fracture was diagnosed on the right maxillary sinus or right side of the maxilla. These options, however, serves as useful distractors because they contain terms and conditions mentioned elsewhere in the summary."
60,1,13329890,What medications was the patient prescribed upon discharge and what were they for?,The patient was prescribed Paracetamol and Aspirin to manage his fever and inflammation.,"The patient was given Docusate Sodium, Oxycodone and Keflex for pain management, stool softening, and bacterial infection prevention.",The patient was put on a regimen of Ibuprofen and Amoxicillin for pain and infection control.,The patient was given Naproxen Sodium and Docusate Sodium for effective pain management and the softening of stools.,No medications were given to the patient upon discharge.,B,"Upon reviewing the discharge summary in note 1, we can see that the patient was discharged with the medications Docusate Sodium (used as a stool softener), Oxycodone (a pain reliever), and Keflex (an antibiotic used to prevent or treat certain kinds of bacterial infections). Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Although other medications are mentioned in the other options, these do not match the details provided in the patient's discharge summary, which makes them incorrect, but a good distractors nonetheless. Option E is incorrect as it contradicts the information in the discharge summary directly."
61,1,11129145,"What procedure was carried out on the patient’s lower left extremity, and how is her post-procedure kidney function?","A triple bypass surgery was performed on the patient’s lower left extremity, and her post-operations kidney function remained stable.","An SFA stenting and left lower extremity angiogram were performed on her lower left extremity, and her post-operations kidney function improved slightly.","The patient underwent a procedure for her fibromyalgia, and her kidney function remained stable.","A hip replacement surgery was performed on her lower left extremity, and her kidney function slightly deteriorated post-procedure.","A colonoscopy was performed on the patient’s lower left extremity, and post-procedure kidney function remained the same.",B,"From the provided discharge summary, it is noted under 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' that the patient underwent an SFA stenting and angiogram of the left lower extremity. The hospital's brief course elaborates that her kidney function, specifically her creatinine (Cr) levels, decreased or 'down-trended' from 1.3 to 1.1 after the procedure. The implication is that her kidney function improved slightly. Options A, C, D, and E, although containing information present in the notes, don't answer the question accurately. The patient didn't undergo a triple bypass, fibromyalgia procedure, hip replacement, or colonoscopy, leading us to dismiss answers A, C, D, and E, confirming that B is the correct response."
62,1,17918647,What injuries were identified upon patient's admission and were there any changes in these injuries during the course of his hospital stay?,The patient got facial abrasions during the assault and they showed significant improvement at the time of discharge.,"The patient displayed a non-displaced fracture of the left frontal bone extending through the left frontal sinus, left anterior ethmoid air cells, and left olfactory groove. Over the course of the stay, the condition remained stable.","The patient also had a small left temporal extraaxial hematoma, likely subdural in the absence of an adjacent fracture. But this condition was completely healed at the end of his hospital stay.",The patient had a small right inferior temporal hemorrhagic contusion which was completely resolved at the time of discharge.,The patient showed a small right inferior temporal hemorrhagic contusion with minimally increased edema during his hospital stay and it showed no change in the condition.,B,"The patient was admitted with multiple injuries including a non-displaced fracture of the left frontal bone. This fracture showed no significant change during his hospital stay, which can be inferred from the term 'stable' used in the discharge summary. In contrast, options A, C, D, and E are all incorrect. Option A is incorrect because the question asked about injuries and facial abrasion does not count as an injury or trauma in this case. Option C is incorrect because the record mentions the left temporal extraaxial hematoma became less conspicuous and not completely healed. Option D is incorrect because even though the right inferior temporal hemorrhagic contusion showed a decrease in the subarachnoid hemorrhage, it did not resolve completely. Option E is incorrect because the edema did increase (though minimally) and it did not remain completely unchanged."
63,1,13031876,What was the potential cause of the hypoxemic respiratory failure that the patient experienced during this admission?,The patient had a heart attack (myocardial infarction),The patient had a blood infection (leukocytosis),The patient aspirated leading to lung issues,The patient's liver condition deteriorated,The patient's chronic tobacco use caused lung damage,C,"Hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough oxygen. The patient's hospital notes indicate that his hypoxemic respiratory failure was potentially caused by aspiration, a situation where something like food or liquid enters the lungs instead of going down the esophagus and into the stomach. This can lead to infection or damage of the lungs, worsening the failure. Other options like the patient's heart attack (myocardial infarction) (A), blood infection (leukocytosis) (B), deterioration of his liver condition (D), or damage due to chronic tobacco use (E) may have contributed to his overall health condition but they are not mentioned as potential direct causes of the hypoxemic respiratory failure in this specific case."
64,1,19921868,"What were the patient's initial clinical signs and symptoms, and which potential conditions were considered based on these and his recent travel history?","The patient initially showed signs of confusion, blurry vision, and neck stiffness. Conditions considered include meningitis, malaria, viral syndrome, and hyperthyroidism.","The patient exhibited symptoms of headache, shaking chills, and fatigue initially. Possible conditions contemplated include viral syndrome, meningitis, malaria, and dengue fever.","The patient's initial symptoms included night sweats, sore throat, and fatigue. Various conditions thought of include malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever, and viral syndrome.","The patient presented with symptoms of headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia. Conditions considered include viral syndrome, meningitis, malaria, and yellow fever.","The patient initially had symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Possible conditions considered include malaria, typhoid fever, viral syndrome, and dengue fever.",B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient's initial symptoms were headaches, shaking chills, and fatigue. Therefore, option B is correct. Potential conditions that were considered based on the patient's symptoms and recent travel history included viral syndrome, meningitis, malaria, and dengue fever. Option A incorrectly listed confusion, blurry vision, and neck stiffness as initial symptoms. Although these symptoms were mentioned in the note, the patient denied having them, making option A incorrect. Option C is wrong because the patient denied the symptoms of night sweats and sore throat listed in the options. Similarly, option D and E incorrectly listed symptoms that the patient did not present with initially."
65,1,17766001,"What are some of the key post-surgical instructions that were provided to the patient, especially with respect to physical activity and pain management?",Patient should resume gym exercises and lifting heavy objects within a week.,Patient should walk 2-3 times a day for certain time period as part of their recovery and should not lift anything greater than 10 lbs for 2 weeks.,Patient should stop taking previously prescribed medications and rely solely on pain medications prescribed at discharge.,Patient should sit or stand continuously without moving their body for over an hour.,Patient doesn't need to follow physical therapy from professionals and can perform those routines according to their personal preference.,B,"The instructions provided to a patient are usually rooted in helping the patient recuperate from the surgery and avoid causing additional harm to their body. Option B is the correct one because it highlights cutting out heavy physical activities which might stress the post-surgery body (weightlifting restriction) and recommends light exercises such as daily walks. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because these actions can harm the patient and delay recovery. For example, heavy gym exercises can strain the body, stopping prescribed medications without medical consultation can lead to complications, sitting or standing constantly can introduce pressure and discomfort, and not following professional physical therapy might not be effective and could lead to injuries."
66,1,16137983,What radiographic findings were observed post the patient's Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery?,Visualization of tubes and lines in the chest region,The presence of a pneumothorax,Normal pulmonary vasculature and bases of the lungs affected by atelectasis,An enlarged LAD aneurysm,Appearance of a mass in the patient's chest,C,"The radiographic findings mentioned in the medical note following the patient's Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery essentially revolved around the clear upper lungs, normal pulmonary vasculature, and atelectatic changes at the bases of the lungs. Hence, Option C is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because it was mentioned that the lines and tubes had been removed at the time of the radiographic examination. Option B is wrong because the note explicitly states that there was no pneumothorax observed. Option D is not correct because there isn't mentioned of LAD aneurysm in the radiographic findings. Lastly, option E is incorrect because there was no mentioning of any mass in the patient's chest. Therefore, the correct answer is option C since it is the only choice that accurately and directly answer the question based on the details provided in the notes."
67,1,18310908,What was the past medical history of the patient admitted on the chartdate 2172-09-28?,Patient had a history of bladder cancer.,Patient had a history of migraines and post-ablation vaginal bleeding.,Patient previously underwent a hepatic cyst resection.,Patient had a history of alcohol cirrhosis and pancreatic cancer.,Patient had a history of respiratory distress and a pulmonary condition.,B,"The past medical history listed in the provided notes states two conditions: migraines and post-ablation vaginal bleeding. Though other conditions and medical events are mentioned throughout the text, these belong to either current admissions-related diagnoses or family history. Choice B correctly summarizes this while the remaining options, although referring to other health conditions mentioned in the note, pertain to other context. Option A and D mention health conditions that were actually part of the patient's family history, not their personal medical history. Option C references a current medical event (the hepatic cyst resection) from the current admission. Option E refers to findings from the physical exam performed on current admission, not from the patient's past medical history."
68,1,19815179,What surgical procedures and repairs were performed in the patient's operating room visit for the left long finger injury?,Repair of his leg muscle and tendon ,Treatment for ADHD and related injuries,Irrigation and patching of a skin defect,"Open reduction and internal fixation of middle and distal phalanges, tendon repairs, nerve repairs, and artery repairs",Treatment for a left ring finger amputation,D,"The correct answer is D as the discharge summary under 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' and the 'Brief Hospital Course' sections clearly spell out that the patient had an Open Reduction and Internal fixation of both middle and distal phalanges of the left long finger, along with numerous related repairs.  Option A is incorrect because the discharge summary does not mention anything about the treatment or repair of his leg muscle and tendon.  Option B is wrong because while the patient does have ADHD according to the 'Past Medical History', there was no treatment performed for it in relation to the finger injury.  Option C is distractive because irrigation was performed, but it was in cleaning the injured area, not for a skin defect. Option E is not correct because while the injury happened on the left ring finger, there was no amputation performed according to the discharge summary."
69,1,19825125,"What were the results of the patient's physical exam on the day of admission, with particular reference to his neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal observations?","The patient was disoriented with labored breathing, and mild RUQ tenderness was detected.","The pulmonary exam revealed severe respiratory distress, and cardiac and gastrointestinal checks were normal.","Neurological examination revealed normal gross function, his cardiovascular condition was stable, respiratory assessment was unremarkable, and gastrointestinal exam found a soft, non-tender abdomen.","The neurological examination was inconclusive, cardiovascular signs exhibited irregular rhythms, respiratory distress was evident, and gastrointestinal examination revealed severe abdominal distention.","The patient was neurologically impaired and had cardiovascular instability, severe respiratory distress, and abdominal distension on gastrointestinal examination.",C,"The correct answer is C as it accurately summarizes the physical exam findings detailed in the discharge summary without copying the text word for word. The neurological exam found the patient to be alert, cardiovascular assessment was normal as was the respiratory check, and gastrointestinal examination revealed a soft, non-tender abdomen. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they either inaccurately translate or exaggerate the findings of the physical exam. Each however, contains elements derived from the discharge summary making them potential distractors. For example, under GI section, there was a report of 'RUQ tenderness', but it was mild, not severe (option A and E). Similarly, the patient did not display respiratory distress (options B and D)."
70,1,18056298,What were the final diagnoses made to explain the patient's abdominal pain during the hospital stay charted on 2137-06-14?,Migraines and severe anxiety triggering gastrointestinal symptoms,Acute pancreatitis partnered with muscle spasms in the right lumbar region,Focal fatty infiltration of the liver causing discomfort,Acute appendicitis resulting in abdominal distress,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,B,"The discharge summary indicates that the patient was finally diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and muscle spasm. This is derived from the 'Discharge Diagnosis' section of the summary where 'Acute pancreatitis' and 'Muscle spasm' are mentioned. The other options are incorrect. For instance, option A is incorrect as 'anxiety' and 'migraines' were part of the patient's past medical history but no such implication was made relating these conditions to the current abdominal pain. Similarly, option C, 'Focal fatty infiltration of the liver,' was found on the CT scan, but it's not stated this was the cause of the patient's abdominal pain. Option D, ‘Acute appendicitis’ is incorrect because the patient has had her appendix removed before. Option E, 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome' is also a part of her medical history, but it does not correlate with the final diagnosis."
71,1,15950987,What was the patient's glucose level at the time of admission and what were the concerns regarding her Diabetes management during her hospital stay?,"The patient's glucose level was 100, and she refused to continue her medication during her hospital stay.",The patient's glucose level was 253 and she requested a change in her Diabetes medication during her hospital stay.,The patient's glucose level was 145 and she refused insulin and POC glucose checks during her hospital stay.,The patient's glucose level was 143 and she requested to stop her Diabetes medication.,The patient's glucose level was 253 and she refused insulin and POC glucose checks during her hospital stay.,E,"The patient's glucose level was 253 on admission as stated in the labs second: ""___ 08:13PM GLUCOSE-253*."" Answer E is correct because it also accurately reflects the concern about her Diabetes management: she refused sliding scale insulin and POC glucose checks, as stated in the notes under ""#DM Patient refused sliding scale insulin and POC glucose checks."" All the other options are incorrect but good distractors as they include elements from the discharge summary. However, they give inaccurate glucose levels or incorrect concerns regarding her Diabetes management."
72,1,17586417,What procedures were done to manage the patient's necrotizing pancreatitis during hospitalization?,Placement of esophageal balloon,Recipient of Dilaudid and Midazolam for pain and sedation,Devised towards decompressive laparotomy,"Administration of norepi, epi, and vasopressin",Subsequent initiation of CVVH using an HD catheter,C,"The patient underwent a decompressive laparotomy procedure as defined in the admission note to manage her necrotizing pancreatitis (Choice C). Despite being procedures or interventions, the placement of an esophageal balloon (Choice A), the administering of Dilaudid and Midazolam (Choice B), usage of norepi, epi, and vasopressin (Choice D), and the initiation of Continuous Veno-Veno Hemofiltration (CVVH) through an HD catheter (Choice E) are just supporting measures taken during the course of the patient's hospital stay and not specifically directed at managing the necrotizing pancreatitis condition."
73,1,16529844,What was the status of the patient's gas exchange and what necessitated endotracheal intubation?,"The patient's gas exchange was abnormal, and endotracheal intubation was necessary due to respiratory failure.","The patient's gas exchange was normal, but endotracheal intubation was necessary because the patient had started vomiting.","The patient's gas exchange was normal, but he was intubated due to potential airway obstruction as he didn't respond to nasal trumpet.","The patient's gas exchange was abnormal, and he was intubated because of severe hypotension.","The patient's gas exchange showed abnormalities, which prompted intubation after a failed nasotracheal attempt.",C,"The discharge summary states that there was no evidence of gas exchange abnormality in the patient (which means it was normal), and the patient was intubated due to unresponsiveness to the nasal trumpet - indicating a potential issue with his airway. This corresponds to option C. Options A and D mention an abnormal gas exchange which is not true. Although vomiting (option B) and unsuccessful nasotracheal intubation (option E) did occur, these weren't the initial reasons for intubation, which was primarily for airway protection due to the patient's state of intoxication."
74,1,12909773,What were the injuries identified in the patient after he was admitted to the hospital on 2178-07-10 following a train accident?,The patient had a mild case of hypothermia and multiple fractures in both hands.,The patient had fractures along the spinal column and was unresponsive due to trauma.,"The patient had damage to the left hand, right hand and right knee, in addition to a decreased breath sound in the left chest.",The patient suffered a heart attack due to the shock and trauma of the accident.,The patient experienced injuries to the head resulting in a significant decrease in the Glasgow Coma Scale.,C,"The third option rephrases the identified injuries at the time of hospital admission from the discharge summary: injury to left hand, lacerations to right hand and right knee, and diminished breath sounds on the left chest. Choices A is incorrect as mild hypothermia was a condition the patient presented alongside injury, not an injury itself while multiple fractures were only identified in hands not both. B is incorrect because there were no identified fractures along the spinal column, and he was unresponsive because of intubation not trauma. Choice D is incorrect because there was no mention of a heart attack in the discharge summary, and the cause of patient's unresponsiveness was not explicitly related to shock or trauma of the accident. E is incorrect as while the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was mentioned as being 4, there were no injuries to the head reported. All distractors are incorrect but are plausible according to information provided in the discharge summary."
75,1,15880385,"What were the lab results suggesting severe liver damage in the patient during the initial admission, and what was the patient's final diagnosis?",High white blood cell count and the patient was diagnosed with Polymyalgia Rheumatica,"Increased ALT and AST levels, and the patient passed away shortly after admission",Abnormal blood glucose level and the patient related to cholangitis and biliary sepsis,High levels of HCO3 and the patient was transferred to another hospital for emergent ERCP,Elevated creatinine and urea levels and the patient was diagnosed with kidney failure,B,"The question relates to the lab results indicating severe liver damage and the patient's final diagnosis. In the discharge summary, the patient's ALT and AST levels were elevated, indicating severe liver damage. The patient's final diagnosis was death as the patient expired shortly after admission. Although all other answer choices (A, C, D, E) contain information from the discharge summary, they are false because they do not accurately respond to what the doctor’s question was asking. While the notes show high white blood cell count, elevated HCO3, blood glucose, creatinine and urea levels, these are not direct indicators of severe liver damage. Furthermore, the final diagnosis does not pertain to Polymyalgia Rheumatica, cholangitis or biliary sepsis, or a kidney failure."
76,1,14285052,What is the primary medical condition that prompted the patient's most recent hospitalization as indicated in the discharge summary charted on 2174-02-24?,Constant feeling of nausea and vomiting due to flu.,Presence of severe anxiety.,The patient was suffering from an unspecified eating disorder.,Recurrent experiences of prolonged QT intervals on ECG.,Suffering from bulimia and electrolyte imbalance.,C,"The patient’s recent hospitalization was primarily driven by an unspecified eating disorder, as confirmed in the discharge diagnosis. It is mentioned several times in the discharge summary that the inability to tolerate food and induced vomiting are linked to the patient's eating disorder.  Option A is incorrect because there is no mention of flu being responsible for the patient's hospitalization.  Option B, although partially correct because the patient did experience anxiety, is not the primary cause of hospitalization. It seemed to be a consequence of her eating disorder rather than the main reason for her hospital visit. Option D is not correct because there was initial concern for QT prolongation on her ECG; however, this was ultimately not felt to be the case. Option E is incorrect too, the patient did have bulimia and electrolyte imbalance but these are all part of the larger issue which is, her eating disorder. Thus, for the primary medical condition, the correct answer is C."
77,1,10685120,What was the patient's primary diagnosis upon discharge and what was the prescribed treatment plan?,The patient was primarily diagnosed with mononucleosis and was prescribed a course of antibacterial therapy with azithromycin and cefpodoxime.,The patient was primarily diagnosed with azithromycin/ceftriaxone deficit and was prescribed cefpodoxime/azithromycin,The patient was primarily diagnosed with kidney stones and was prescribed doxycycline for treatment.,The patient was primarily diagnosed with colonic adenoma and was instructed to avoid contact sports and sexual contact.,The patient was primarily diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and was treated by using aspirin.,A,"The discharge summary indicates that the patient was diagnosed primarily with community-acquired pneumonia, not mononucleosis, kidney stones, colonic adenoma, or atrial fibrillation. The treatment plan included a regime of azithromycin and cefpodoxime, not doxycycline or aspirin. Even though the patient was also diagnosed with mononucleosis, this was not the primary diagnosis but a secondary one discovered during the treatment of the pneumonia. Similarly, the patient’s past medical history includes colonic adenoma and kidney stones, but these did not factor into the discharge diagnosis. The atrial fibrillation mentioned in the notes was the patient's mother's condition, not his. Hence, Option A is the correct answer."
78,1,13716775,What was the diagnosis at discharge and what medical treatments were prescribed for the patient with Admission ID: 29076073?,The discharge diagnosis for the patient was endometriosis and was prescribed antibiotics for treatment.,"The discharge diagnosis for the patient was ovarian mucinous neoplasm and latent mycobacterium infection / TB with reactivation and was prescribed Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Ibuprofen, and OxyCODONE for her treatment and managing pain.",The discharge diagnosis for the patient was PMH and was prescribed epidural for pain relief.,The discharge diagnosis for the patient was pmh and was prescribed antibiotics for latent TB and ileus.,The discharge diagnosis for the patient was gynecologic oncology and was prescribed airborne precautions.,B,"The correct answer is B because the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of ovarian mucinous neoplasm and latent mycobacterium infection / TB with reactivation. Also, the medications prescribed to her include Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Ibuprofen, and OxyCODONE which are primarily for managing her pain. The other answer choices, while containing elements from the discharge summary, don't accurately answer the asked question. For instance, answers A, D, and E incorrectly stated the final diagnosis. Answer C was incorrect since epidural was used immediately after the operation to control pain but was not a part of the discharge medication."
79,1,12341966,What was the patient's treatment plan post discharge for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis?,The patient was advised to continue using Ferrous Sulfate for 3 weeks.,The patient was recommended to take Valsartan 80 mg daily.,The patient was asked to maintain Lovenox therapy for three weeks and then continue with aspirin for another three weeks.,The patient was instructed to take Hydromorphone 2mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.,The patient was advised to restrict the use of NSAIDs.,C,"According to the discharge notes, the patient's post-discharge treatment plan to prevent deep vein thrombosis included a course of Lovenox (Enoxaparin) for 3 weeks, followed by Aspirin 325mg, taken twice daily for a subsequent three weeks.   The A option is invalid as Ferrous sulfate is generally aimed towards dealing with anemia or iron deficiency, not deep vein thrombosis. For answer choice B, Valsartan is used to manage high blood pressure rather than prevent thrombosis. Choice D describes a pain management strategy rather than a thrombosis prophylaxis preparation. Finally, the last option E mentions the restriction of NSAIDs, which is true but does not relate directly to deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Thus, the correct treatment mentioned in the discharge notes is choice C."
80,1,10753990,What was the result of the patient's endoscopic procedure and what accompanying recommendations were given in regards to follow up examinations?,The patient's endoscopic procedure found a large tumor in the esophagus; she was recommended to have oncology follow-ups.,"During the endoscopic procedure, the patient was found to have an object that looked like a lobster shell lodged in the esophagus which was then successfully removed; she was advised to have Neck and Chest X-rays as a post procedure follow-up.",The patient's endoscopic procedure revealed constrictions in the esophageal tract; repeated procedures were recommended for dilation.,The endoscopic procedure found some fresh food stuck in the patient's esophagus; advice was given to eat soft diet.,The endoscopic procedure showed the patient had inflammation of the esophagus; she was recommended to start anti-inflammatory medication.,B,"From the discharge summary, it is known that the patient had an esophagoduodenoscopy due to a foreign body lodged in her esophagus. The foreign body found appeared like a lobster shell. Post procedure, the patient was advised to get neck and chest X-rays to check for any remaining foreign body. There is no mention of a large tumor (A), esophageal constrictions (C), fresh food lodged in esophagus (D) or inflammation needing medication (E) in the discharge summary, which makes them incorrect choices. However, all the options can be considered as potential outcomes of an endoscopy of the esophagus, making them viable distractors."
81,1,18304672,What were the primary complications during the patient's staged PCI intervention on the LAD and what clinical steps were taken to manage these complications?,The patient experienced an aortic dissection which was managed with emergency surgery.,The patient underwent an unsuccessful attempt at stent placement which was followed by the application of an Impella device.,"The procedure was complicated with coronary perforation, which was managed by deploying a covered stent and using an Impella device for hemodynamic support.",The patient experienced a severe allergic reaction to the medication used during the procedure which was managed with antihistamines.,"The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during the procedure, which was managed conservatively.",C,"The correct answer is Option C, as it correctly describes that during the atherectomy of the LAD, a coronary perforation occurred. This was managed by deploying a covered stent and using an Impella device for hemodynamic support. Option A is incorrect as the patient didn't experience an aortic dissection. Option B is incorrect because the stent placement was not unsuccessful; rather it was the atherectomy that led to complications. Option D is incorrect as there is no mention of the patient having an allergic reaction to medication. Option E is also incorrect because it is mentioned that patient did not have a Myocardial Infarction (MI) during the procedure. All of these incorrect options are mentioned somewhere in the discharge summary, therefore making them good distractors."
82,1,17724039,What was the diagnosis for the patient's chest pain and what further advice was given upon discharge?,The pain was due to an ischemic heart disease and the patient was advised to continue taking medications.,"The patient's pain was attributed to a heart attack, and discharge instructions included stopping smoking.",The pain was caused by heartburn and they were counseled to stop smoking.,The pain was due to a heart attack and he was counseled to quit smoking.,The chest pain was tied to stress and the patient was encouraged to reduce anxiety and stress levels.,C,"The final diagnosis for the patient's chest pain was that it was likely due to heartburn. This is indicated in the Discharge Instructions of the note, where it's mentioned that it was 'likely that your pain was due to heartburn'. Answer C correctly paraphrases this piece of information. The patient was also advised to quit smoking. While answer D also mentions about quitting smoking, it incorrectly suggests that the chest pain was due to a heart attack, which was not the case. Similarly, Answers A, B and E also incorrectly identify the cause of the patient's chest pain, which is why they are considered distractors. Answer C also aligns with further advice given to the patient upon discharge."
83,1,15550845,"What changes were made to the patient's medication regimen after the hospitalization for hypotension due to dehydration, and what was the contributing factor to the changes?",The patient was prescibred an additional medication for high blood pressure.,Lisinopril dosage was increased and metoprolol succinate dosage was reduced due to low blood pressure.,The patient was advised to stop taking lisinopril and reduce dosage of metoprolol succinate because of hypotension.,No changes were made to the patient's medication regimen.,The patient was prescribed additional pain medication.,C,"Upon admission, the patient was taking Lisinopril 7.5 mgs daily and Metoprolol Succinate 25 mgs daily among others. The discharge summary clearly states that the following changes were made to the medication regimen: 1. STOP lisinopril. 2. DECREASE metoprolol to 12.5mg. The contributing factors to these changes were the patient's dehydration, hypotension, and lightheadedness. Therefore, Answer C is correct. Answer A is incorrect because no high blood pressure medication was added. Answer B misstates the change to the Lisinopril dosage, which was stopped, not increased. Answer D is incorrect because changes were clearly made to the patient's medication regimen. Answer E is improper because no additional pain medication was added to the patient's discharge medication."
84,1,10829250,"What was the main surgical procedure implemented during the patient's stay on 2172-05-25, and what symptoms did the patient present initially that led to this procedure?",The patient underwent a routine Colonoscopy due to a history of intermittent fever and nonproductive cough.,The patient underwent a Prostate surgery due to a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia.,The patient underwent a Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting due to a history of chest pain and an elevated troponin level.,The patient underwent a Cardiac Catheterization due to a history of nasal congestion and intermittent fever.,The patient underwent an Aortic Valve Replacement due to a history of tachycardia and chest pain.,C,"The correct answer is option C which states that the patient underwent a Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) due to a history of chest pain and an elevated troponin level. This can be confirmed from the discharge summary which notes that the patient complained of chest pain (Chief Complaint section) and underwent a CABG (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure). Elevated troponin level is synonymous with Troponin ruled in NSTEMI as stated in the History of Present Illness.   Option A is incorrect because the discharge summary does not indicate that the patient underwent a Colonoscopy.  Option B is incorrect because while the patient does have a history of a prostate surgery, that was not the main surgical procedure carried out during the hospital stay in question.  Option D is incorrect because even though a cardiac catheterization was performed (revealing 4 vessel disease), that was not the main surgical procedure, the CABG was.  Finally, option E is incorrect because there's no mention in the discharge summary that the patient underwent an Aortic Valve Replacement. Therefore, C is the correct answer."
85,1,14118396,Which coronary artery of the patient was found blocked and treated with a stent during the cardiac catheterization procedure?,The patient had a stent placed in the Right coronary artery,The patient had a stent placed in the Left anterior descending artery,The patient had a stent placed in the Left main coronary artery,The patient had a stent placed in the Left circumflex artery,The patient had a stent placed in the Right ventricular artery,D,"The mention of ""Promus Drug eluting stent placed to Left Circumflex artery"" in the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section of the discharge summary indicates that the patient had a blockage in the Left circumflex artery which was treated with a stent. Answers A, B, C, and E are incorrect as they refer to different arteries and there is no mention in the discharge summary of these arterial being blocked or treated with stents. These distractors would seem plausible to someone who is not familiar with the specific details of the patient's procedure."
86,1,10848276,"What was the patient's reaction to the use of Vancomycin for the treatment of her cellulitis, and what alterations were made to her treatment plan as a result?","The patient experienced a severe allergic reaction, following which her treatment was switched to a course of doxycycline and supplemental fluconazole.","The patient had no noticeable adverse effects from the Vancomycin, and completed the whole course of treatment without incident.","The patient experienced a mild discomfort after taking Vancomycin, but continued with the treatment.",The patient showed symptoms of a severe respiratory distress due to Vancomycin which led to discontinuation of the treatment.,"After the introduction of Vancomycin, the patient started having severe abdominal pain which led to alteration in her medication.",A,"The patient developed a total body itching and some flushing from Vancomycin, symptoms which are characteristic of mild allergic reactions (Choice D and E are incorrect due to symptoms not matching those of the patient). As a result, she was given diphenhydramine (also known as Benadryl) which improved her symptoms. Her treatment was then shifted to a 10-day course of doxycycline along with a prescription for fluconazole in case she developed a yeast infection due to the use of antibiotic (Choices B and C are incorrect as the vancomycin was not continued after the reaction)."
87,1,10511841,"What is the family history of diseases, as reported in the patient's record on 2143-05-04, and did any of them affect the patient's decision to donate her kidney?","The family has a history of hypertension, diabetes, lung disease all of which contributed to the patient's choice of kidney donation.","Her father had diabetes and her sister has IgA nephropathy, both of which led to the patient's decision to become a kidney donor.",The family history includes breast cancer and lupus which influenced the patient to donate her kidney.,The family history of diabetes and dialysis influenced her decision to donate the kidney.,Her mother's history of smoking lead to her decision to donate her kidney.,B,"Answer choice B is correct because the note indicates that the patient's father died of complications of diabetes and was on dialysis, and her sister has IgA nephropathy. Both conditions are related to kidney function and health, which the patient has chosen to assist with by donating her kidney. The other options are incorrect as they either include conditions not related to kidney health (A, C, E) or do not mention the affected sister's condition (D), which is one of the primary reasons for the patient's donation."
88,1,12391745,What was the patient's presenting complaint and what surgical procedure was undertaken to manage it?,"The patient presented with kidney stones, and a lung nodule removal procedure was performed.","The patient came in due to severe pain from a deviated nasal septum, and corrective surgery was carried out.","The patient suffered from kidney stones, and laser lithotripsy and left ureteroscopy were conducted.","The patient was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux, and a procedure for benign prostatic hypertrophy was implemented.","The patient had tinnitus, and a surgery to correct sleep apnea was undertaken.",C,"The patient's chief complaint, according to the discharge summary, was nephrolithiasis, also known as kidney stones. To address this, a left ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy operation were performed, per the ""major surgical or invasive procedure"" section of the summary. While items mentioned in options A, B, D, and E, such as the lung nodule, deviated nasal septum, gastroesophageal reflux, tinnitus, and sleep apnea were in the patient's past medical or surgical history, they're not relevant to the patient's current presentation and the executed procedure."
89,1,14859685,Which medication was prescribed to the patient with a frequency of every 8 hours at the time of discharge?,Levothyroxine was given once daily.,Hydromorphone was instructed to be consumed every 4 hours as needed.,Acetaminophen was taken every 6 hours as deemed necessary.,Human immune globulin given once for 1 dose.,Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate needed to be taken every 8 hours for two weeks.,E,"The question asks for the medication given to the patient with the frequency of every 8 hours at the time of discharge. The correct answer is Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate as per the discharge summary mentioned. All other options, (Levothyroxine (A), Hydromorphone (B), Acetaminophen (C), Human immune globulin (D)) are incorrect as they have different administration frequency which doesn't match the 8 hours criterion. Therefore, they are good distractors."
90,1,13448249,"What was the clinical suspicion towards the cause of the expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in the patient, what intervention was performed, and what were the findings?","The patient's enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysm was suspected to be a result of an ongoing endoleak, spinal cord compression was treated, and no abnormal findings were found.","The patient's expanding AAA was suspected to be a result of hypertension, a cardiothoracic surgery was performed, and an enlarged heart was found.","The patient's enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysm was suspected due to a hidden endoleak with a big lumbar artery contributing, a coil embolization of the lumbar artery was performed, and no evidence of endoleak found after the procedure.","The patient's expanding AAA was believed to be a result of diabetes, a limb extension procedure was carried out, and a significant increase in sugar levels was noted.","The patient's AAA enlargement was suspected to be due to lifestyle habits, a graft relining procedure was performed, and blocked arteries were discovered.",C,"The patient's enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysm was suspected to be a result of an occult endoleak from a significant lumbar artery as per the summarization. For this reason, a coil embolization of the lumbar artery was carried out, and the final intraoperative angiogram illustrated a coiled lumbar artery with no evidence of an endoleak. The remaining options are incorrect as they refer to factors, interventions, and findings not mentioned or incorrect in the patient's summary. For instance, options A, B, D, and E refer to an ongoing endoleak, hypertension, diabetes, and lifestyle habits as the cause of the patient's AAA, respectively. However, these are not confirmed in the patient's summary. Similarly, the interventions mentioned in options A, B, and E (spinal cord compression treatment, cardiothoracic surgery, and graft relining procedure) and the findings noted in options A, B, D, and E (no abnormal findings, enlarged heart, increased sugar levels, and blocked arteries) are not confirmed in the summary. Therefore, options A, B, D, and E serve as good distractors."
91,1,19036417,"What was the cause of intrauterine fetal death in the patient, as per her most recent admission?",The patient's obesity caused the intrauterine fetal death.,The patient's body rejected the baby due to her allergy to Demerol.,"The patient's use of tobacco, ethanol, and drugs caused the intrauterine fetal death.",A cord accident is suspected to have caused the intrauterine fetal death.,The patient had a brief period of N/V/D (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) which caused the intrauterine fetal death.,D,"The discharge summary details that the patient's intrauterine fetal death was caused by a suspected cord accident. This is why option D is correct. Option A is incorrect because there's no evidence in the summarry to suggest obesity caused the death. Option B is incorrect because although the patient is allergic to Demerol, it's never mentioned as the cause of the death. Option C is incorrect since the patient denies the use of tobacco, ethanol, and drugs. Option E is also incorrect because the N/V/D which the patient experienced does not connect to the cause of the death as it was already resolved."
92,1,18766290,"Was there any medical indication, from the discharge summary dated 2132-09-22, to suggest that the patient's diplopia might have been caused by a vertebral artery dissection?",The patient's previous hospital records indicate a history of vertebral artery dissection.,The patient's MRI/A head and neck scans revealed the presence of a vertebral artery dissection.,The patient's neurological examination revealed signs of a vertebral artery dissection.,"The patient healthy, right-handed and was a premature baby.",The patient's MRI/A head and neck scans showed no evidence of vertebral artery dissection.,E,"The discharge summary explicitly states that the patient's MRI and angiogram of the head and neck were performed to evaluate for vertebral artery dissection and other contributory abnormalities, and the results showed no evidence of vertebral artery dissection. Therefore, option E is correct. The other distractors, A, B, C, are incorrect as the summary does not mention previous history of vertebral artery dissection, finding in the MRI and neurological examination Supporting a diagnosis of dissection. Option D is also incorrect as it gives non-relevant information about the patient's handedness and birth conditions."
93,1,15941930,What was the result of the patient's cardiac catheterization and what procedure was performed during that time?,The patient's cardiac catheterization showed no abnormalities and the patient didn't undergo any specific procedure.,The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed severe mid RCA stenosis and catheterization of the mid RCA was performed.,The patient's cardiac catheterization resulted in the diagnosis of sinus bradycardia and the patient underwent angioplasty.,The patient's cardiac catheterization showed severe mid RCA stenosis and a bypass surgery was performed.,The patient's cardiac catheterization detected a blockage in the coronary artery and was treated with medicine.,B,"According to the discharge summary, during the patient's cardiac catheterization, a severe mid RCA stenosis was found, and a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stenting (PTCA/Stenting) of a critical late mid RCA stent edge restenosis was performed. Option A is incorrect as abnormalities were found during the catheterization and a specific procedure was performed. Option C is incorrect because, while sinus bradycardia was mentioned in the summary, it didn't result from the catheterization and no angioplasty was performed. Option D is also incorrect, as the procedure performed was PTCA/Stenting, not bypass surgery. Option E is incorrect as it does not specify the correct procedure performed."
94,1,10659243,What was the identified microorganism in the wound culture and what antibiotic therapy was administered accordingly?,The microorganism identified was Staphylococcus and the treatment was IV Vancomycin and Unasyn.,The microorganism identified was Proteus species and she was treated with PO Bactrim and Augmentin.,The identified microorganism in the culture was Pasteurella species and the patient was treated with PO Bactrim and Augmentin.,The cultured microorganisms were Anaerobes but no specific therapy was administered.,"No organism was found in the wound culture, and she was administered Vancomycin and Unasyn pending culture results.",C,"The provided discharge summary specifies that a Pasteurella species was grown from the wound culture following the cat bite. The patient was initially started on IV Vancomycin and Unasyn pending culture results, but based on the culture result, the patient was changed to PO Bactrim and Augmentin (amoxicillin-pot clavulanate according to the discharge medications section) and was discharged home on Augmentin for 7 days. Options A, B, D, and E are therefore incorrect but plausible distractors since the terms IV Vancomycin, Unasyn, Proteus, Staphylococcus, and Anaerobes are all mentioned within the note, but they were either not involved in the patient's treatment or did not grow in the wound culture."
95,1,10640647,"What were the key changes in the patient's blood test results post-surgery based on the records from July 6, 2169?",The patient's blood glucose levels dropped markedly post-surgery.,The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) increased post-surgery.,The patient's hemoglobin levels did not experience any significant changes.,The patient's blood sodium levels drastically increased post-surgery.,The patient's red blood cell count (RBC) significantly increased post-surgery.,B,"In the discharge summary provided, the patient's blood test results indicate an increase in the white blood cell count (WBC) post-surgery with results showing 7.4 before surgery and values ranging from 12.7 to 13.6 after surgery. This is typical in post-operative cases as it is a sign that the body is fighting an infection or responding to inflammation, both common after a surgical procedure.   Answer choice A is incorrect because the patient's blood glucose levels actually increased; from 92 pre-surgery to values ranging from 115 to 146 post-surgery. Answer choice C is incorrect because the patient's Hgb indeed dropped (from 14.9 pre-surgery to levels between 11 to 11.8 post-surgery). For answer choice D, the patient's sodium level did not significantly increase post-surgery; rather it varied a bit. Answer choice E is wrong as the patient's RBC count decreased (from 4.89 pre-surgery to counts between 3.58 to 3.93 post-surgery)."
96,1,18920572,What were the findings and notable details from the MRI of the cervical spine of the patient admitted on 2182-08-12 with a C7 fracture post a mountain biking accident?,A severe fracture through the left C7 facet with a significant misalignment of the left C6-C7 joint,Disruption of the anterior annulus fibrosis at C6-7 with evidence of a significant anterior longitudinal ligament tear.,Pronounced posterior disc protrusion at C6-7 along with significant contact with the spinal cord.,"Mildly comminuted fracture through the left C7 facet with relatively preserved alignment of the left C6-C7 joint, disruption of the anterior annulus fibrosis at C6-7, and midline posterior disc protrusion at C6-7 without contact with the spinal cord.","Significant spinal canal or high-grade neural foraminal narrowing, coupled with apparent cord signal abnormality.",D,"Option D is correct because it accurately describes the MRI findings mentioned in the provided note. Though mildly comminuted fracture through the left C7, disruption of the anterior annulus fibrosis at C6-7, and midline posterior disc protrusion at C6-7 were identified, the spinal cord was not in contact. However, other options such as A, B, C, and E, act as good distractors as they mention elements found in the summary but are not entirely accurate in portraying the implications of the MRI results. For example, options A and B speak of severe fracture and significant ligament tear, respectively, which are not present. Option C incorrectly mentions contact of the protrusion with the spinal cord. Option E, on the other hand, incorrectly states the presence of significant spinal canal or high-grade neural foraminal narrowing and cord signal abnormality."
97,1,17154322,What were the reasons for patient's admission and how was she managed during her hospital stay?,The patient was admitted due to a high glucose level and was managed with metoprolol.,The patient was admitted because of experiencing a fall down stairs and was managed with Sinemet and phenytoin.,The patient was admitted because of osteoporosis and was managed with cosopt and colace.,The patient was admitted due to a chest infection and managed with oral glucose solution.,The patient was admitted due to heart disease and was managed with metoprolol and valsartan.,B,"The patient was indeed admitted due to a fall down stairs as stated in the ""History of Present Illness"" section of the note. During her hospital stay, she was managed with various interventions including phenytoin and continued her home medication, Sinemet which is mentioned in ""Medications on Admission"" section. Options A, C, D, and E mention reasons for admission and management techniques that are not supported by the provided note. For instance, the patient's glucose level and heart disease are not mentioned as admittance reasons and osteoporosis did not appear to need any special management during her hospitalization. While she does have osteoporosis and heart disease as part of her Past Medical History, they were not the reasons for this particular hospital stay."
98,1,18742099,What could be the likely primary cause of the patient's episode of periumbilical abdominal pain observed on the admission date 2160-10-04?,The patient had a history of bone fractures which led to the abdominal pain.,The abdominal pain was likely a result of the patient's Waldenström macroglobulinemia.,The cause of the abdominal pain was the medication that the patient was taking.,The abdominal pain was likely due to an episode of cholangitis.,The abdominal pain resulted from the patient's atrial fibrillation condition.,D,"The only condition that appears to be close to explaining the patient's abdominal pain based on the provided data is cholangitis. The record discusses abnormal liver function tests (LFT), hypotension, and the absence of a clear stone or obstruction in imaging tests – all indicative of a potential case of cholangitis. Whereas, the patient’s history of bone fractures (Choice A) is unlikely to cause abdominal pain. Choice B suggests the patient's Waldenström macroglobulinemia as the cause; however, this condition typically affects the blood and is unlikely to result in abdominal pain. Choice C - the patient's medication cannot be directly linked to the abdominal pain based on the discharge summary provided. Lastly, atrial fibrillation (Choice E) affects the heart and would not directly cause abdominal pain."
99,1,12660059,What was the major presenting complaint of the patient during his admission on 2193-04-23 and how was it managed?,The patient had symptoms of chest pain and was treated with painkillers.,The patient presented with shortness of breath and was put on oxygen therapy.,"The patient experienced abdominal pain, and it was managed with antibiotics and a non-oral diet, after which he was gradually introduced to food.","The patient had a severe headache; the cause was evaluated, and he was given appropriate medication.",The patient complained of abdominal cramps and it was managed with physical therapy.,C,"The discharge summary indicates that the patient's primary complaint was abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as perforated diverticulitis. The patient was kept nil by mouth (NPO) overnight, treated with intravenous antibiotics initially, and then shifted to oral antibiotics as he could tolerate a slowly advancing diet. The other answer choices, while presenting symptoms and management procedures mentioned in the patient's history, do not correlate directly to the major complaint and its management during this particular admission. For example, there is no mention of chest pain (option A), shortness of breath (option B), severe headache (option D), or management with physical therapy (option E) in relation to the abdominal pain complaint."
100,1,17975345,What were the changes in the patient's medication regimen post coronary artery bypass graft procedure?,The patient was prescribed Aspirin 325mg every day.,The patient was prescribed Lisinopril 2.5mg once a day.,The patient was prescribed Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg twice a day.,The patient was prescribed Plavix 75mg once a day.,The patient was prescribed Lescol 40mg once a day.,C,"Post the coronary artery bypass graft procedure, the patient's medication regiment included Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg taken twice a day as per the discharge medications. Though options A, B, D, and E were part of the patient's medication regimen on admission, they were not listed in the discharge medications, indicating these were not part of the patient's post-procedure regimen."
101,1,11904819,Did the patient's abdominal pain and elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs) resolve after the ERCP procedure and what other ailments were observed during her hospital stay?,"The patient's stomachache got worse and LFTs indicated liver failure, no other ailment was seen.","After the ERCP procedure, the patient's abdominal pain ended, but elevated LFTs didn't resolve; she suffered from headaches related to migraines.",The patient's abdominal pain and LFT levels stayed the same after the ERCP procedure; no other sicknesses were observed.,"The patient showed a high tolerance towards ERCP procedure, she didn't experience any abdominal pain or elevated LFTs; she was also diagnosed to be hyperactive.","After ERCP, all the patient's symptoms related to abdominal pains and liver tests got resolved; she was perfectly healthy with no other illnesses found.",B,"The correct answer is B. Following the ERCP procedure, the patient continued to experience abdominal pain and an increase in lipase was shown, indicating pancreatitis related to the ERCP (as stated in the part: ""Lipase > 1100 consistent with ERCP related pancreatitis""). Additionally, the patient was found to suffer from regular migraine headaches. The option A, C, D and E are all incorrect as they either indicate wrong outcomes of the ERCP procedure or incorrectly state the other ailments observed during her stay."
102,1,17686045,"What was the cause of patient's left foot injury, which surgical treatment did he receive, and what post-surgical instructions were given to him?","The patient was injured due to a fall, the surgical treatment consisted of a bone fusion, and the patient was told to avoid weight-bearing on the leg for at least 4 weeks.","The patient was accidentally hit by a heavy I-beam, he had an open reduction and internal fixation of a broken left first toe, and he was instructed to finish his medication, stay non-weight bearing on his left lower extremity (LLE), and keep his splint dry.","The patient sustained the injury during a vehicle accident, his surgery was a joint replacement, and he was told to resume all his pre-operation medications post-surgery.","The foot injury was due to a work-related machinery accident, he underwent a surgical procedure of arthroplasty, and was advised to return to daily activities gradually.","The patient's injury was due to a slipped disc in the spine, he had a spinal surgery, and he was asked not to put weight on his injured leg.",B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient suffered an injury to his left foot when an I-beam accidentally fell on it. He underwent an operation involving cleaning, reduction, and percutaneous pinning of an open left first toe fracture. Post-surgery instructions included staying non-weight bearing on his LLE, completing the course of Keflex, and keeping his splint dry among other things. Options A, C, D, and E may seem plausible but do not accurately reflect the cause of injury, the surgical treatment, or post-operative care as stated in the summary."
103,1,11059150,What was the patient's ejection fraction at the time of transfer and how did it change during the course of the hospital stay?,"The patient's EF at the time of the transfer was 30%, but during the course of the hospital stay, it increased to 55%","At the time of transfer, the patient's EF was 66%, and it dropped down to 30% during his hospital stay",The patient's EF was 30% at the time of the transfer and it increased to 66% during the hospital stay,"The patient's EF was initially 55%, but during the hospital stay, it dropped to 30%","The patient's EF at the time of transfer was 30%, but no change observed during the hospital stay",C,"According to the discharge summary, the Echo at OSH showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% during transfer. Later on, a repeat TTE at the hospital showed that the patient's EF had increased to 66%. So, the correct answer is (C).   Option (A), (D) and (E) are incorrect as the patient's EF improved to 66%, not 55% or remained constant. Option (B) is not accurate because it suggests the EF decreased during the course of the hospital stay, while it actually increased."
104,1,17386998,"What was the final pathologic diagnosis of the patient's large ovarian mass, and what treatment plan does this suggest?","The ovarian mass was diagnosed as a benign mucinous tumor, and it suggests a presentation at the gynecologic oncology tumor board.","The ovarian mass was diagnosed as a borderline mucinous tumor that transformed into a benign carcinoma, recommending a gynecology oncology follow-up.","The ovarian mass was diagnosed as mucinous carcinoma arising in a background of borderline mucinous tumor, suggesting further treatment planning with the gynecologic oncology tumor board.",The ovarian mass was diagnosed as a malignant fibroadipose tissue which suggests administering IV magnesium infusion.,"The ovarian mass was diagnosed as Crohn's disease, suggesting the initiation of Zantac and Zofran medication.",C,"The discharge summary confirms that the large mass in the patient's right ovary was diagnosed as a mucinous carcinoma, which developed from a borderline mucinous tumor (option C). While answers A, B, D, and E include details from the discharge summary, they are incorrect as these either provide a wrong diagnosis for the ovarian mass or suggest a wrong treatment plan. The correct treatment plan involves further discussion and planning through a presentation at a gynecologic oncology tumor board (Option C). The benign mucinous tumor (Option A) and benign carcinoma (Option B) are incorrect as the tumor was found to be malignant. Option D mentions a malignant fibroadipose tissue found in the omentum, not in the ovarian mass. Option E entirely misinterpreted the diagnosis by referring to Crohn's disease, which is actually a separate condition the patient has."
105,1,11823831,"What is the past surgical history of the patient, and why is she undergoing total thyroidectomy?",The patient had a total thyroidectomy previously and is now having it again due to high cholesterol.,The patient had a total thyroidectomy and excision of thyroglossal cyst before and is undergoing it again because of recurring experiences of multinodular goiter.,The patient had total thyroidectomy and intraoperative nerve monitoring before because of the discovery of a thyroglossal cyst.,The patient had a TAH/BSO operation in the past and is now having a thyroidectomy due to multinodular goiter with recurrent hyperthyroidism.,The patient's past surgical history is unidentified and she is undergoing total thyroidectomy due to an adverse drug reaction.,D,"The patient's history of surgical procedures mentioned in the note includes Total thyroidectomy, intraoperative nerve monitoring, excision of thyroglossal cyst, and TAH/BSO. In terms of these, only TAH/BSO does not have a correlation to the recent surgery or the underlying condition causing her to undergo thyroidectomy. The reason she is undergoing total thyroidectomy now is mentioned in the discharge diagnosis as multinodular goiter with recurrent hyperthyroidism. While all the other choices mention clues from the provided note, they are not accurate to the question. For example, Option C only mentions part of the past surgical history and does not address why she is undergoing the surgery now. Similarly, Options A and E are incorrect as high cholesterol or unidentified surgical history and adverse drug reaction are not the reasons for her to undergo thyroidectomy now. Option B improperly suggests that the patient is having the exact same operations as before, which contradicts the patient's current surgical status."
106,1,15811241,"What diagnosis was given to the patient upon their discharge from the hospital, and what were the given medications for the patient?",The patient was diagnosed with severe back pain and given an antibiotic.,The patient was diagnosed with a non-specific abdominal issue and was given analgesic medication.,"The patient was diagnosed with lower body pain (including hip, back, leg) and given medication including Pantoprazole, Acetaminophen and an Oxycodone-Acetaminophen compound.",The patient was diagnosed with chronic abdominal pain and was prescribed a bowel regimen medication.,The patient was diagnosed with a degenerative spinal condition and provided with a walking aid.,C,"The correct answer is C as the patient was diagnosed with ""Left hip/back/leg pain"". The medications given to the patient were ""Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen ___ mg Tablet"". Option A is incorrect because there is no mention of an antibiotic being prescribed to the patient. In option B, although the patient was given analgesic medication, the diagnosis is incorrect. In option D there is no mention of a bowel regimen medication being prescribed, or a specific diagnosis of chronic abdominal pain. Option E includes misinformation about the diagnosis and only partially correct info on the intervention, which was prescribing a medication and not a walking aid."
107,1,12774568,"What was the patient's medical history, and what treatment was administered during this hospital stay in response to her preeclampsia?","The patient had a medical history of uric acid issues, and they were treated with sulfonamide antibiotics.","The patient denied any past medical history, and she was treated with labetalol 200 TID and administered 100mcg PR of cytotec for postpartum hemorrhage.","The patient had a history of sulfonamide antibiotics allergy, and the treatment was a blood transfusion to increase the RBC count.","The patient presented with a history of hypertension, and the treatment given was induced labor.","The patient had no relevant medical history, the treatment administered was solely labetalol 200 TID.",B,"From the information given in the discharge summary, we can deduce that the patient denied having any past medical history. Regarding the administered treatment, the patient was admitted with preeclampsia and treated with labetalol 200 TID. After delivery, she experienced a postpartum hemorrhage that required treatment with 100mcg PR of cytotec to contract the uterus. The other options are incorrect as they are either based on the wrong interpretation of medical history (options A, C, and D) or do not provide the full scope of treatments given during the stay (option E)."
108,1,14224443,What was the course of treatment suggested for this patient's dementia and delirium during her hospitalization?,The patient was suggested to take Ativan 0.5mg and Ibruprofen 400mg on a daily basis to manage her symptoms.,The patient management strategies included daily exercise along with a regimen of Calcium Carbonate 500 mg Tablet and Cyanocobalamin 500 mcg Tablet.,"The patient was started on Seroquel 12.5mg BID PRN and Trazodone 25mg QHS. Non-pharmacological strategies such as timely toileting, nutrition/hydration, constipation management, and sleep cycle regulation were also enforced.",The patient's dementia and delirium were solely managed by a combination of Vitamin D3 and Calcium Carbonate 500 mg tablets.,"The patient was suggested to take Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet, and Calcium Carbonate 500 mg Tablet daily.",C,"Option C accurately represents both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical care plan for the patient's delirium and dementia. Ativan and Ibruprofen (Option A) were not primarily used for dementia and delirium. Option B does not address delirium and dementia, but is more concerned with physical health and falls under conditions like osteoarthritis and bone fractures. Similarly, Option D and E mainly addresses physical conditions and not dementia or delirium. Both these options are good distractors as they mention medication that the patient was given, but not for the management of her dementia and delirium condition.  This shows that even though treatments can overlap, every condition requires a specific treatment approach aligned with its unique physiological etiology and symptoms."
109,1,10165080,"After the surgery, where was the patient instructed to put most of her weight and how long was she supposed to continue DVT prophylaxis using lovenox?",The patient was suggested to put most of the weight on the right lower extremity and continue DVT prophylaxis for two weeks after surgery.,The patient was instructed to put most of the weight on the left lower extremity and continue DVT prophylaxis for eight weeks.,The patient was instructed to put most of her weight on the right lower extremity and continue DVT prophylaxis for four weeks.,The patient was instructed to put most of her weight on the left lower extremity and continue using lovenox for DVT prophylaxis for four weeks.,The patient was advised to split her weight evenly between both lower extremities and continue DVT prophylaxis for four weeks.,D,"In the discharge summary, it is clearly stated that the patient was instructed to be ""touchdown weight bearing in the left lower extremity"". This means she should put most of her weight on the left lower extremity. The instructions also mention to ""take lovenox daily for 4 weeks"" which is the DVT prophylaxis. Option A, B, C, and E are not correct as they either suggest the wrong leg or the wrong duration for continuing DVT prophylaxis."
110,1,14055279,"What allergies does the patient have, and what significant condition in the patient's past medical history might have contributed to his current condition?",The patient is allergic to penicillin; they previously had a kidney transplant.,The patient has dairy and NSAIDS allergies; they earlier had Lyme disease.,The patient experiences an allergic reaction to fur; they had tetanus in the past.,The patient is allergic to dairy and NSAIDS; they were previously diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.,The patient is allergic to gluten; they had pneumonia before.,D,"Based on the information provided in the discharge summary, the patient is allergic to dairy and NSAIDS, which is correctly stated in options D and B. However, the significant condition from the patient's past medical history that might have contributed to his current condition is Lynch syndrome, only mentioned in option D. This makes option D the correct answer. Options A, B, C, and E mention conditions not stated in the patient's discharge summary, making them incorrect but good distractors if one hasn't carefully read the provided notes."
111,1,16718800,What surgical procedures were undertaken following the patient's right small finger distal tip amputation?,Ampulating the small finger just distal to the DIP joint.,Cutting down the digit to reduce its length and modifying the bone structure at the end of the finger.,Undertaking a full neurologic exam of the amputated finger.,Coating the amputated area with betadine and wrapping in wet gauze.,Injecting the amputated finger with a local anesthetic and flushing with saline.,B,"The surgical procedures post the patient's right small finger distal tip amputation included shortening the bone of the affected digit and fixing it internally, as well as dejecting the wound up to the bone and repairing the skin along with the soft tissues. Option A implies a process inverse to the surgical operations done on the patient. Option C is incorrect as it was clarified that it is uncertain if such an examination was carried out prior to anesthesia. Option D outlines the immediate first aid given at the accident spot, not the surgical procedures that were followed. Option E also describes the immediate medical care rendered at the location of the incident, not the surgical interventions performed. Only Option B accurately reflects the series of procedures carried out on the patient following his accident, making it the correct response."
112,1,10589353,What significant incidental finding was noted during the aggressive antihypertension patient's treatment and what course of action was taken to address it?,A significant incidental finding during the patient's treatment was a stable Type B Aortic Dissection. No specific course of action was taken to address it.,The patient was found to have a blood pressure of 133/66 during the treatment. Adjustment in medication dosage was used to address it.,A pancreatic mass was discovered incidentally during the patient's treatment. A follow-up MRI was scheduled with the primary care provider to confirm the finding.,The patient's blood glucose level was found to be 93. No immediate action was taken to address it.,The patient was also found to have thyroid dysfunction. An adjustment in thyroid medication was executed to address it.,C,"The patient's discharge summary shows an incidental finding of a pancreatic mass during her aggressive antihypertensive treatment. The proposed action was her contacting her primary care provider for an MRI. Although options A, D, and E mention findings present in the patient's health history or discharge diagnoses, they do not correspond to an unexpected finding discovered during the ongoing treatment for high blood pressure. Incidental findings refer to unexpected findings unrelated to the current treatment. Option B, though referring to a change in blood pressure, is not ""incidental"" nor significant as it is directly related to the ongoing hypertension management."
113,1,13035389,What were the findings of the colonoscopy and EGD performed on the patient during his hospital stay?,A blockage was discovered in the colon,Signs of Crohn's disease were detected in the colon and terminal ileum,"A normal looking duodenum and colon was observed, including the terminal ileum",The results were inconclusive with no clear findings presented,An ulcer was detected in the patient's stomach during the EGD,C,"According to the information present in the doctor's notes, the colonoscopy revealed a normal-appearing colon and terminal ileum. During the EGD, the duodenum also appeared to be normal. No ailment-specific findings were reported which counter Options A, B, D, and E. These options were included as distractors since some patients might have these conditions diagnosed through colonoscopy or EGD, but they were not applicable in this patient's case."
114,1,19410606,"What was the initial treatment for the patient's cellulitis, and was the treatment effective?",Patient was first treated with acetaminophen which provided pain relief.,Patient initially received amp/sulbactam 3 gram IV that improved condition significantly.,Cefadroxil 500 mg was administered initially which effectively cured the patient's cellulitis.,"The patient initially received cefadroxil 500 mg treatment for cellulitis, but the condition worsened.","Cellulitis was first treated with PO amoxicillin/clavulanate, leading to an improved state.",D,"The patient was initially treated with cefadroxil 500 mg for her cellulitis as mentioned in the narrative. However, it's stated that the condition worsened during the course of this treatment, so option D is correct. In option A, the acetaminophen was used for pain management, not cellulitis treatment. In option B and E, amp/sulbactam and PO amoxicillin/clavulanate were used, but they were not the initial treatments. Option C is wrong as it suggests cefadroxil cured the cellulitis, which contradicts the information from the discharge summary."
115,1,15737699,"What type of injury did the patient sustain, how was it treated, and on what medications was he discharged?","The patient sustained a leg wound that required suturing, was treated with a splint and was sent home with a prescription for Penicillin VK and Percocet.","The patient had a minor burn on the left forearm that was cleansed and bandaged, post-procedure physical therapy was initiated and was discharged on medication for a bowel regimen.","The patient had a right zygomatic maxillary complex fracture necessitating open reduction internal fixation, and was discharged on medications such as erythromycin, chlorhexidine gluconate, polyvinyl alcohol-povidone, amoxicillin-pot clavulanate, acetaminophen, and oxycodone.","The patient experienced a severe headache, was evaluated under the mental/psych services, and upon discharge, he got prescriptions for antibiotics and pain medication.","The patient suffered from severe dental problems, underwent a surgical extraction, and was discharged with antibiotics and oral health care recommendations.",C,"According to the patient's chart, they suffered a right zygomatic maxillary complex fracture that was treated through an open reduction internal fixation. The patient was discharged with a range of medications, including erythromycin, chlorhexidine gluconate, polyvinyl alcohol-povidone, amoxicillin-pot clavulanate, acetaminophen, and oxycodone. All other options are incorrect as they reference other pieces of the patient's history or other minor injuries (A, B) from the discharge summary, or make incorrect assumptions (D, E) about the patient's treatment and discharge medications."
116,1,16362679,What was the resultant outcome of using IV vancomycin on the patient's condition?,"The patient's leg increased in size and redness, displaying signs of continued inflammation.",The patient's skin showed clear signs of athlete's foot.,There was significant improvement in the patient's cellulitis and fever.,There was a sudden increase in the patient's white blood cell count.,The use of IV Vancomycin led to adverse drug reactions.,C,"In the discharge summary, it is explicitly mentioned that IV vancomycin significantly improved the patient's cellulitis and reduced fever. Hence, Option C accurately reflects the outcome of using IV vancomycin on the patient's condition. Although the other options mention potential health situations that could occur in a general scenario, none of them are relevant or accurate to the patient in the provided summary. For example, Options A, D, and E represent negative outcomes that are not documented in this patient's chart. Similarly, although the patient did have skin issues (such as erythema), these were not related to athlete's foot (Option B). Hence, Options A, B, D, and E are good distractors as they all contain plausible health issues, but do not correctly answer the question based on the provided notes."
117,1,11972871,What is the patient's allergy information and what were the major surgical or invasive procedures performed?,The patient is allergic to gluten and underwent an appendectomy.,The patient has allergies to aspirin and had a laparoscopic gallbladder removal.,The patient has allergies to morphine and Penicillins and the major surgical procedure performed was R long TFN.,The patient is allergic to iodine and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting.,The patient has allergies to dairy and underwent a tonsillectomy.,C,"According to the discharge summary, the patient's known allergies include morphine and Penicillins (under Allergies). The major surgical procedure listed is R long TFN (under Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure). This makes option C the correct answer. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they mention allergies and procedures that are not listed in the patient's discharge summary. However, they could be good distractors if the reader does not carefully go through the detailed summary."
118,1,11400312,What were the discharge medications prescribed to the patient for her achalasia and what dietary instructions were provided to her post-surgery?,"The patient was discharged with an ibuprofen prescription and dietary instructions included a full liquid diet, to avoid chewing gum and carbonated drinks, and advance to canned fruits, vegetables, and chicken steak once she had no difficulties in swallowing.","The patient was discharged with Acetaminophen and OxycoDONE , and dietary advice was to start with soft foods and clear liquids, advance to moist foods like pudding and yogurt, and eventually include fresh fruits, vegetables, and rice in her diet as tolerated.","The patient was discharged with a prescription of Acetaminophen and OxycoDONE, and dietary instructions involved starting with a roasted chicken and mashed potatoes diet, and avoid swallowing air to prevent bloating.","The patient was discharged with prescriptions of Acetaminophen, OxycoDONE and ibuprofen, and was advised to stay on a clear liquid diet including soup, chowders, and juices until recovery.","The patient was discharged with no prescriptions, and dietary instructions included proceeding from clear liquids to solid foods such as eggs and oatmeal as tolerated without causing excessive bloating or gas.",B,"The discharge medication prescribed to the patient were Acetaminophen and OxycoDONE, not ibuprofen as mentioned in options A and D. Option E states incorrectly that the patient was discharged with no prescriptions. The dietary instructions given to the patient as outlined in option B are correct: she was advised to begin with clear liquids and soft foods, transitioning to foods such as eggs, yogurt, and cottage cheese. From this stage, she was to gradually include a wider variety of foods as she was able to tolerate them. Options A, C and D, and E do not capture all aspects of the instructions accurately – option A mentions starting with a full liquid diet which is incorrect, option C mentions starting with a roasted chicken and mashed potatoes which is wrong, and option D suggests the patient was advised to stay on a clear liquid diet, which is also incorrect as she was advised to progress from clear liquids to more substantial foods as tolerated."
119,1,10729844,"What allergic reaction does the patient have, and what surgical procedure has she undergone due to her recent accident?",The patient is allergic to Enoxaparin Sodium and underwent an LVX procedure.,The patient is allergic to acetaminophen and underwent a posterior hip dislocation procedure.,The patient is allergic to Penicillins and underwent an ORIF procedure.,The patient is allergic to oxycodone and underwent a SI joint procedure.,The patient has no allergies and underwent ACL repair surgery.,C,"From the discharge notes, we know that the patient is allergic to Penicillins and she underwent an ORIF (Open Reduction Internal Fixation) surgery due to a recent automobile accident causing acetabular fracture and posterior hip dislocation. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as the patient isn't allergic to Enoxaparin Sodium, acetaminophen, or oxycodone, and there is no mention of her undergoing LVX, posterior hip dislocation, SI joint or ACL repair surgeries."
120,1,15495532,"What were the complications experienced by the patient postpartum, and what was the course of action taken to manage it?",The patient experienced a severe headache and was prescribed to rest.,The patient had complications due to allergies and required allergic reaction mediation.,The patient suffered from anxiety and was taken care of with an increased dose of sertraline.,The patient was affected by gestational hypertension and required medication adjustment.,The patient had complications due to vaginal bleeding and was recommended bed rest.,D,"The correct answer is D because the patient's postpartum course was complicated by gestational hypertension, requiring medication adjustments. This fact can be inferred from the ""Brief Hospital Course"" section of the discharge summary. All other options are incorrect but plausible distractors as they relate to patient conditions or symptoms outlined elsewhere in the discharge summary. Option A refers to a patient's headache symptom but it was not postpartum. Option B is incorrect because the patient had no known allergies. Option C is incorrect as the medication sertraline, usually used to treat anxiety, was indeed given, but the complication was not due to anxiety. Option E is wrong because vaginal bleeding was denied by the patient in the ""History of Present Illness"" section."
121,1,14844903,What was the result of the blood culture test conducted on admission and what antibiotics were prescribed to the patient based on the result?,The blood culture test detected no bacterial growth and the patient was given acetaminophen and aspirin.,"The blood culture detected the presence of Escherichia coli (E.coli), and the patient was prescribed azithromycin.","Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was found in the blood culture, which then drove the prescription of antibiotics from the start with vancomycin and cefepime to a narrower prescription of cefazolin.","The blood culture test results revealed MSSA bacteremia, and the patient was started on a course of amoxicillin.",The blood culture test results showed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria and the patient was prescribed ceftriaxone.,C,"The patient's blood culture tested positive for MSSA bacteremia as indicated in the discharge summary. The patient was first started on vancomycin and cefepime, which was later narrowed down to cefazolin based on culture sensitivities. The other options are incorrect, as they mention either a different bacterium was detected or an incorrect antibiotic was prescribed based on the discharge summary. The choices do include content from the discharge summary and thus serve as good distractors, but none match the question's requirement other than option C."
122,1,15818249,"What is the primary condition for which the patient was admitted to the hospital on 2128-05-14, and what was the initial clinical impression for his condition?",The patient was admitted for increasing shortness of breath due to progressing pulmonary fibrosis and concern for congestive heart failure.,Anxiety was the primary cause of the patient's admission with worsening hypertension as an initial clinical impression.,The patient was hospitalized due to back pain resulting from past spinal stenosis surgery.,The admission was due to exacerbation of the patient's hypertension.,The patient was admitted due to an uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia.,A,"Based on the discharge summary, the patient was admitted due to increasing shortness of breath believed to be a result of progressing pulmonary fibrosis (as evidenced in A). A potential heart failure was suggested in the clinical impression due to his symptoms. B, C, D and E are valid distractors since they all mention conditions that the patient has, but none of them were the primary reasons or initial impressions for the admission on 2128-05-14."
123,1,10373148,What was the patient's heart condition post the uterine artery embolization procedure and how was it managed?,The patient developed accelerated heart rate post-procedure that was managed with calming medications.,The patient developed second degree heart block post-procedure that was managed with defibrillator.,The patient developed tachycardia post-procedure which was managed with regular EKG monitoring.,"The patient developed bradycardia and first degree AV block post-procedure, that was stabilized by adequate pain control.","The patient developed hypertensive crisis post-procedure, managed with administration of beta blockers.",D,"The patient's discharge summary states that post-procedure, the patient developed bradycardia and 1st degree AV block - manifestations of which were a slowed down heart rate and 6 sec block observed on telemetry. The management for this was primarily pain control, as the bradycardia was likely due to high vagal tone triggered by post-op pain. By ensuring adequate pain control, the heart rate was brought back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Alternative answer choices (A, B, C and E) mention other heart conditions and treatments that were not reflected in the patient's summary, and indeed some of these events or treatments (tachycardia, defibrillator, beta blockers) would be in contradiction to the bradycardia (slow heart rate) as stated in the summary."
124,1,18780293,What factors in the patient's previous history might have contributed to the development of the thumb cellulitis and abscess?,She has a known allergy to certain medications.,The patient has nocturnal enuresis that might have caused an infection.,"The patient's vitamin D deficiency weakened her immune system, leading to an infection.",The patient reported previous use of injection drugs and current cocaine use.,"She has a schizoaffective disorder, which might have triggered a physical illness.",D,"The patient's previous history of drug use, especially the injection of unknown substances, could have exposed her to various bacterial infections, potentially including Staph aureus, which is noted in the wound culture. This factor aligns most closely with the development of cellulitis and an abscess. The other options (A, B, C, and E) are indeed part of the patient's past history, but they are unlikely to directly contribute to the development of cellulitis and an abscess. A known allergy to certain medications (Option A) doesn't necessarily lead to infections. Nocturnal enuresis (Option B) and Vitamin D deficiency (Option C) are relatively unrelated to this type of skin infection. Finally, while mental health issues, like schizoaffective disorder (Option E), have wide-ranging impacts, they are not typically direct causes of skin infections."
125,1,19482948,What was the reason behind performing a C-section on the patient during the admission dated 2167-12-25? ,The patient had a severe allergic reaction to the labetalol medication.,The patient had a non-responsive fetal heart rate after increasing the dosage of Pitocin.,There was a rapid escalation in the patient's blood pressure.,The induction of labor was unsuccessful due to severe preeclampsia and concerning fetal heart rate.,The patient requested a C-section as she was no longer tolerant of the labor pains.,D,"The discharge note suggests that the C-section was arranged due to a combination of severe preeclampsia and a troubling fetal heart rate after the patient failed to respond to the induction of labor. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.  Option A is incorrect because the patient never had an allergic reaction to labetalol, they were on the medication to control their blood pressure.  Option B is not entirely correct because, while there was a concern for the fetal heart rate, this alone was not the reason for the C-section.  Option C is wrong because, even though the patient had high blood pressure, the decision to perform the C-section was ultimately based on the unsuccessful labor induction process and the fetal heart rate, not blood pressure per se.  Finally, Option E is not accurate since the patient did not ask for a C-section due to labor pains. The decision was medical, not personal or based on discomfort."
126,1,18699973,What non-operative treatments were provided during the patient's hospital visit for the partial small bowel obstruction?,A regular diet and physical activity,"Bowel rest, IV fluid resuscitation, nasogastric tube for stomach decompression, and serial abdominal exams",Intake of prescribed medications on admission such as Levothyroxine Sodium and Sertraline,Use of venodyne boots and subcutaneous heparin,"Ambulation, respiratory toilet, and incentive spirometry",B,"The non-operative treatments mentioned in the summary that were provided during the patient's hospital visit involve bowel rest, IV fluid resuscitation, the use of a nasogastric tube for stomach decompression, and serial abdominal exams. This makes option B the correct answer. Option A (regular diet and physical activity) is incorrect as these were introduced after symptoms improved. Option C (intake of medications like Levothyroxine Sodium and Sertraline) may be plausible treatments, but they are not related specifically to the bowel obstruction and are more related to the patient's other medical conditions. Option D (use of venodyne boots and heparin) and E (ambulation, respiratory toilet, and incentive spirometry) may sound relevant but are part of maintaining good overall health during their hospital stay and are not specific non-operative treatments for the bowel obstruction. Thus, these options are good distractors."
127,1,16760081,What is the patient's past medical history and how may this impact their current treatment and prognosis?,"The patient has a history of epilepsy, which will require careful management of pain medications due to potential interactions.",The patient has a history of hypertension and will need monitoring of blood pressure during the recovery process.,"The patient's past medical history includes ADHD, ADD, and a previous femur fracture, which may influence pain management due to previous medication use and the existing fracture might complicate the healing process.","The patient has a history of diabetes, which might affect wound healing and infection risk, and would require careful blood glucose monitoring.","The patient's past medical history includes osteoporosis, which might indicate taking calcium supplements or other medications to strengthen her bones.",C,"This is the accurate answer as the patient's past medical history includes ADHD, ADD and a femur fracture. The ADHD and ADD might influence the patient's pain management, given the fact that the patient might have been on medication for it. The past femur fracture might also add a level of complication in the healing period after the operation. The other options are incorrect as they refer to illnesses like epilepsy, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis that are not mentioned in the patient's past medical history."
128,1,19946596,"What were the surgical procedures carried out on the patient during hospital stay, as per the available discharge summary?",The patient underwent sinus surgery and cerclage.,"The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, cystoscopy, and abdominoplasty.",The patient underwent treatment for allergic rhinitis and borderline diabetes.,The patient received bandaid for codeine allergies.,The patient underwent surgery for HTN and SVT treatment.,B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, cystoscopy, and abdominoplasty. While options A, C, D, E are subjects mentioned in the summary, they're not the surgical procedures carried out during the patient's hospital stay. The sinus surgery and cerclage (option A) are part of the patient's past medical history; the treatment for allergic rhinitis and borderline diabetes (option C) are part of the patient's past medical history; allergies to codeine and bandaids (option D) requires medical attention, but not a surgical procedure; HTN and SVT treatment (option E) are part of the patient's past medical history, not surgical procedures carried out during this hospital stay."
129,1,15590743,What was the patient's lipase level upon admission and what was the patient's lipase level prior to discharge?,The patient's lipase level upon admission was 15 and prior to discharge it was 10.,The lipase level on the patient's admission was close to 3000 and it dropped to approximately 200 prior to discharge.,The patient's lipase level at admission was 1452 and it rose to 2821 prior to discharge.,"Upon admission, the lipase level of the patient was at 498 and it increased to 773 at the time of discharge.","At the time of admission, the patient recorded a lipase level of 298, which rose to 1552 prior to discharge.",B,"In the discharge summary, it is stated that the patient's lipase was near 3000 upon admission and reached approximately 200 within 36 hours. There is no mention of lipase levels at the specific time of discharge, but it can be inferred that the level stayed the same or possibly dropped a bit lower from the last recorded level. Option A is incorrect as the mentioned lipase levels were not present. Option C, D and E are accurate lipase values from the report but they incorrectly represented the initial or final levels of lipase during the patient's stay."
130,1,17211250,What is the medication the patient was taking during the hospital stay that could have contributed to her second fall?,The patient was administered morphine during her stay.,The patient was using hydroxychloroquine.,The patient was on a dose of penicillins.,The patient was taking Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics).,The patient had recently taken oxycodone.,E,"The discharge summary mentions the patient 'attempted to go to the bathroom after recently taking oxycodone' and then experienced her second fall, suggesting that the oxycodone could have contributed to the fall. Although options A to D refer to medications mentioned in the report, none of them are specifically linked to the timing of the patient's second fall. Morphine was given during her hospital stay but not likely at the time of her second fall. Hydroxychloroquine, penicillin, and Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) are listed as the patient's allergies, not current medications, but were included as distractors since they were in the discharge summary."
131,1,15046313,"What was the surgical intervention performed due to the patient's obstructing ampullary mass, and did it result in the alleviation of the patient's symptoms?","The patient underwent two ERCP procedures and sphincterotomy, which led to a reduction in liver function test values.",The patient had a surgery and ERCP which resulted in a significant loss of weight.,"The patient had a procedure to remove gallstones, alleviating abdominal pain.","The patient had knee arthroscopy, which resulted in improved mobility.","The patient had an umbilical hernia repair, reducing discomfort in the abdominal area.",A,"The discharge summary indicates that the patient had two ERCP procedures and a sphincterotomy in response to an obstructing ampullary mass. It's implied that these interventions led to improvement, given the note about liver function test continuing to rise before the sphincterotomy. Option B is incorrect as there's no mention of surgery related to the ampullary mass, and weight loss is associated with the illness, not a result of the intervention. Option C is wrong as no gallstones were removed. Options D and E are unrelated surgeries from past medical history and don't connect to the ampullary mass or its symptoms."
132,1,18085070,"What medication changes were made during the patient's hospital stay, and what were the reasons for these changes?","Started daily intake of Imdur ER 30mg, stopped Hydrochlorothiazide and Losartan due to UV exposure.",Removed Atorvastatin 40 mg from the medication list due to harmful liver effects.,Removed Losartan Potassium and Hydrochlorothiazide due to unsteadiness in blood pressure levels and added Imdur ER 30mg to prevent future angina episodes.,Added Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) 30 mg to help with hypothyroidism management.,Doubled the dose of Levothyroxine Sodium due to deteriorating thyroid function.,C,"The hospital added Imdur ER 30mg to prevent future angina and removed Losartan Potassium and Hydrochlorothiazide since the patient was having lower blood pressure. Option A is incorrect because the medications were not stopped due to UV exposure. Option B is incorrect because no alteration was made to Atorvastatin, and it was not associated with harmful liver effects. Option D is incorrect because Isosorbide Mononitrate was provided to prevent angina, not for treating hypothyroidism. Option E is wrong because no changes were made to the dosage of Levothyroxine Sodium."
133,1,10925226,"What was the course of treatment prescribed for the patient's pneumonia during this hospital stay, including any changes in medication, and what is the subsequent monitoring plan for the related pulmonary condition identified in his imaging results?","The patient was initially treated with 750mg of levaquin and blood tests were performed. Subsequently, he was given a 14-day course of same levaquin, switched to oral steriods, and advised to continue his home dose of prednisone. It was recommended he have a repeat chest CT-scan scheduled within several weeks.","The individual was given in-home oxygen, 2L IV, theophylline, and restarted on a regular dose of 10mg prednisone upon discharge.",The patient received treatment for prostate cancer and was advised to continue watchful waiting.,"The patient was treated with Dorzolamide-Timolol, Enalapril Maleate, Atenolol, Theophylline, and Lavotan eye drops; and was prescribed a steroid-induced hyperglycemia treatment.",The attendee was administered hydrocort 50mg IV q8 due to mild hyoptension and history of chronic steriod use.,A,"The discharge summary reveals that the patient was treated for pneumonia with 750mg levaquin, after which his condition improved. Intravenous steroids were also started which were switched to oral steroids later. In addition, a 14-day course of oral levaquin was also given to the patient. A repeat CT-scan was recommended to monitor the ill-defined rounded hyperdensity in the left lower lung base.  Choice B refers to the maintenance of his COPD, not the pneumonia. Choices C, D, and E discuss other aspects of the patient's treatment (prostate cancer monitoring, ongoing medication regimen, temporary acute care measures, respectively) but does not address the full scope of the pneumonia treatment and subsequent monitoring plan covered in question. Therefore, these are good distractors as they are related to the patient's overall health management during his hospital stay."
134,1,10005909,What were the surgical procedures the patient underwent during the admission charted on 2144-11-02?,Amputation of the left lower extremity,Installation of a pacemaker,"Mechanical thrombolysis, placement of IVC filter, repeat mechanical thrombectomy, and placement of common iliac wall stents.",Hysterectomy,Gastric bypass surgery,C,"The correct answer is option C, as it is stated in the discharge summary that the patient underwent ""Mechanical thrombolysis, placement of IVC filter, repeat mechanical thrombectomy, and placement of common iliac wall stents."" during the admission charted on 2144-11-02. Option A, D and E are incorrect because there's no mention of an amputation, hysterectomy, or gastric bypass surgery in the discharge summary. Option B is incorrect because the patient didn't undergo any heart-related procedures like the installation of a pacemaker."
135,1,16348559,What was the bacteria species identified in the intra-operative cultures and what antibiotic regiment was being introduced for discharge?,The bacteria species identified was trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole species and the antibiotic regiment introduced for discharge was Acetaminophen.,The bacteria species identified was methicillin sensitive coagulase negative staphylococcus species and the antibiotic regiment introduced for discharge was Daptomycin.,The bacteria species identified was methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus species and the antibiotic regiment introduced for discharge was vancomycin,The bacteria species identified was methicillin sensitive coagulase negative staphylococcus species and the antibiotic regiment introduced for discharge was Vancomycin.,The bacteria species identified was vancomycin resilient pseudomonas aeruginosa species and the antibiotic regiment introduced for discharge was Daptomycin.,B,"The bacteria species identified in the intra-operative cultures was a methicillin sensitive coagulase negative staphylococcus species, as stated in the discharge summary. Furthermore, infectious diseases recommended the transitioning to Daptomycin on hospital discharge as an antibiotic treatment, hence it was the antibiotic regiment introduced. Although options A, C, D and E contain pieces of medical information available in the patient’s discharge summary, they represent false distractors for the question as they combine the correct details in an inaccurate way or provide incorrect bacteria species and antibiotic regiments."
136,1,13114222,"What were the results of the patient's Postoperative Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and calcium level tests, and what was their relevance?","PTH was low and calcium was high, indicating a healthy recovery","PTH and calcium levels were elevated, indicating potential complications","Both PTH and calcium levels were low, suggesting a potential deficiency","PTH and calcium levels were within normal range, indicating no complications from surgery","PTH was high while calcium was low, indicating a postoperative imbalance",D,"The discharge summary mentions that postoperatively, the patient's PTH and calcium levels were normal. This implies successful surgery and that no complications arose related to these particular hormones, aligning with option D. The other options are incorrect. Option A is incorrect as the patient's PTH was not low nor was calcium high. B is wrong since neither PTH nor calcium levels were elevated. C is incorrect as neither PTH nor calcium levels were low. E is wrong because PTH wasn't high and calcium wasn't low. Despite these options being incorrect, they serve as suitable distractors because they use data from the summary but misrepresent the postoperative results."
137,1,19891914,"What were the initial symptoms the patient presented with upon visit to his PCP, which led to his admission in the ED?",The patient reported experiencing severe chest pain.,The patient had a non-productive cough and hypothesized foul appetite.,"The patient reported extreme fatigue, blurred vision, and a significantly decreased appetite.",The patient experienced severe abdominal pain and irregular bowel movement.,The patient felt normal but was asked to come to the ED due to elevated blood sugar levels from his routine check-up.,C,"The patient's symptoms that were reported during the initial visit to the PCP included extreme fatigue, blurred vision, and drastically reduced appetite, all kin to the controlled medications for other morbid conditions the ederly patient has. He was feeling weak, tired, and had blurry vision ever since he started a new cancer pill. His appetite also significantly decreased. Choice A is not correct because the patient experienced pleuritic chest pain following his lobectomy, but it was not an initial symptom upon his visit to the PCP. Choice B is partially correct as the patient did report a non-productive cough, but the appetite loss was not guessed, but rather stated by the patient. Choice D is incorrect because the patient denied any abdominal pain. And finally, choice E is incorrect because the patient was not feeling normal. His symptoms of fatigue, blurred vision, and reduced appetite contributed to the elevated blood sugar levels, making the patient hyperglycemic."
138,1,15499898,What was considered as a potential source for the patient's abdominal pain and what measures were taken to manage it during her hospital stay?,The patient's abdominal pain was potentially due to a urinary tract infection and was managed with antibiotics.,"The onset of menstruation was considered a possible cause of the patient's abdominal pain, which was managed with painkillers.","The patient's abdominal pain was potentially caused by an ovarian torsion, and she underwent a surgical procedure to manage it.","The patient's pain was likely due to a gastrointestinal disorder, and diet modifications were implemented.",The suspected cause of the patient's abdominal pain was appendicitis which was managed with an appendectomy.,B,"The discharge note indicates that the patient started her menses shortly after admission, which was thought to contribute to her pain. Measures taken to manage her pain included the administration of painkillers like oral tylenol and motrin. The patient no longer required narcotics by hospital day 2.   Option A is incorrect, no urinary infection was reported in the notes. Option C is also incorrect because though the patient had a history of ovarian torsion, that was not the identified cause in this case, and no surgical procedure was conducted during this hospital stay. Option D is not correct because there's no mention of a gastrointestinal disorder in the patient's notes. Lastly, option E is incorrect, there's no mention of appendicitis or an appendectomy in the notes. These options serve as good distractors as they are plausible causes of abdominal pain but do not match this patient's condition as documented in the summary."
139,1,14241052,"What procedures or tests were conducted to confirm there were no additional injuries from the crush injury, and what were their results?","The patient was immediately put under anaesthesia and a series of surgical procedures were conducted, revealing no additional issues.","Physical examinations, blood tests, and imaging scans were conducted, revealing multiple rib fractures but no additional injuries.","Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, showing no internal injuries or complications.",Only physical examination was relied upon for the identification of any other injuries.,Various allergen tests were conducted to detect if the patient had any underlying allergies that could potentially complicate the treatment process.,B,"The discharge summary clearly mentions in the ""Imaging"" and ""Pertinent Results"" sections that a series of tests including blood tests and imaging scans (CT scans of the Spine, Head, Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis, CXR, and scans for Left Knee, Hand, and Ankle) were conducted. These tests revealed that the patient had multiple rib fractures but no other significant injuries. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect as the summary does not mention conducting any surgery, diagnostic laparoscopy, relying exclusively on physical examination, or running allergen tests."
140,1,18147802,"What are the laboratory results for liver function tests, specifically ALT and AST, during the patient's hospital stay dated 2136-03-23?",ALT- 298 units per liter; AST- 192 units per liter,ALT-124 units per liter; AST-280 units per liter,ALT- 162 units per liter; AST- 0.5 units per liter,ALT- 50 units per liter; AST- 21 units per liter,ALT- 329 units per liter; AST- 100 units per liter,A,"ALT and AST, which are laboratories markers for liver function, had levels of 298 units per liter and 192 units per liter, respectively as mentioned in the Discharge Summary on the patient's hospital stay dated 2136-03-23. The other options, while they are numerals pulled from the laboratory results in the note, they are attached to incorrect readings (e.g., Glucose, AlkPhos, PTH, LD(LDH) levels, not ALT nor AST) or completely made up and do not correlate with the ALT and AST readings."
141,1,11379140,"What was the possible etiology for the patient's recurrent stroke as mentioned in the discharge summary on 2121-08-18, and what were the observed symptoms?","End-stage renal disease prompted the patient's recurrent stroke, and the patient displayed severe expressive aphasia and right-sided weakness.","The patient's recurrent stroke was likely due to a possible reaction to her allergy to Diltiazem Analogues, and she showed signs of profound aphasia and right-sided weakness.","Cardioembolic reasons could possibly be the cause for the patient's recurrent stroke, and the patient presented symptoms like severe expressive aphasia, left gaze preference, and right-sided weakness.","Type II Diabetes Mellitus could potentially be the cause for the patient's recurrent stroke, while symptoms included left gaze preference and profound aphasia.","The potential cause for the recurrent stroke is predicated on the patient's hypertension, and symptoms included severe expressive aphasia and global aphasia.",C,"From the discharge summary, the most plausible cause for the patient's recurrent stroke is mentioned as cardioembolic. There is no specific mention of the other conditions (End-stage renal disease, allergy to Diltiazem Analogues, Diabetes Mellitus, and Hypertension) leading to the stroke. The symptoms described for the patient include severe expressive aphasia, left gaze preference, and right-sided weakness, which matches option C. The other options, while mentioning conditions the patient has or symptoms that were present, do not properly pair the likely cause of the stroke with the correct symptoms."
142,1,19278377,What complications did the patient face after the Open cholecystectomy surgery and how were they managed?,"The patient experienced severe abdominal pain after the operation, managed with anti-inflammatory medication.","The patient faced hallucinations after consuming PCA, which was managed by reducing the PCA dosage and giving him ketorolac.",The patient exhibited signs of a severe infection and was managed with strong antibiotics.,The patient had trouble swallowing food and was managed with an altered diet and throat exercises.,"The patient faced cardio-related issues like palpitations after the operation, managed through beta-blockers.",B,"In the discharge summary, it is stated that the patient suffered from hallucinations after the PCA medication was administered. The medical team tackled this issue by reducing the PCA dosage and resorting to ketorolac to control the pain and relieve the symptoms. None of the other complications were reported. This makes options A, C, D, and E incorrect as they are not documented in the discharge summary. However, they do serve as logical distractors since these issues could arise after a surgical procedure."
143,1,11370839,What were the discharge medications prescribed after the patient's partial nephrectomy procedure?,"Colace (docusate sodium), Senokot, and Narcotic pain medication.","Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Oxycodone, Apixaban, Atorvastatin, NIFEdipine, and Triamterene-HCTZ.",Asprin and Vitamin E supplement.,"Apixaban, Atorvastatin, and NIFEdipine only.",Acetaminophen only.,B,"Based on the discharge summary, the patient was prescribed several medications including Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Oxycodone for moderate pain, Apixaban, Atorvastatin, NIFEdipine, and Triamterene-HCTZ.  Option A could provide a good distractor because Colace and Senokot were mentioned in the discharge instructions, but they were not listed under discharge medications. Option C is incorrect because asprin and Vitamin E were specifically advised to avoid. Option D only includes a subset of the prescribed drugs. Option E lists only one medication out of the seven discharge medications. Therefore, option B is correct."
144,1,17867552,"What medical procedures were performed during the patient's last hospitalization, and were there any complications during the course of their hospital stay?",The patient underwent spinal surgery and experienced complications due to the onset of diabetes.,The patient had a bronchoscopy with an intraoperative pneumothorax occurring as a complication.,The patient had a right upper lobectomy and right atrial repair with a complication of pneumothorax.,The patient was treated for melanoma and encountered post-operative hemorrhage.,"The patient underwent surgery for osteoporosis, with complications related to hypertension.",C,"According to the discharge summary, the patient underwent a right upper lobectomy and right atrial repair during her hospital stay. A pneumothorax (air between the lung and chest wall) was noted as a complication during her postoperative period. Therefore, option C is correct. Option A is incorrect because the patient didn't undergo spinal surgery and no complications related to diabetes were mentioned. Option B is incorrect as bronchoscopy wasn't the procedure performed and intraoperative pneumothorax has not been reported. Option D is incorrect because the patient was not treated for melanoma, and no post-operative hemorrhage was mentioned. Option E is incorrect as the patient didn't have surgery for osteoporosis and hypertension complications were not reported during her hospital stay."
145,1,12037190,What was the primary diagnosis at discharge and what significant findings led to this conclusion during the patient's previous hospital stay?,Primary diagnosis was Rheumatoid Arthritis. This was concluded due to minor lesion found in the OM artery during cardiac catheterization.,Primary diagnosis was Hypertension. This was concluded due to the patient's intermittent chest pain and heart fluttering symptoms.,Primary diagnosis was Noncardiac Chest pain. This was concluded due to normal cardiac catheterization results and the absence of significant coronary artery disease.,Primary diagnosis was Congestive Heart Failure. This was concluded from the patient's elevated CK-MB levels during their stay.,Primary diagnosis was Ventricular Tachycardia. This was concluded based on the patient's history of intermittent heart fluttering for the past few years.,C,"The primary diagnosis at discharge was Noncardiac Chest pain. This is inferred from several factors, including the patient's presentation of chest pain, absence of significant coronary artery disease during cardiac catheterization, and normal cardiac enzyme levels. The other choices, while containing details from the patient's medical record, do not accurately reflect the primary diagnosis at discharge. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hypertension were listed as secondary diagnoses, not primary. Despite the patient's history of heart fluttering, Ventricular Tachycardia was not diagnosed. Congestive Heart Failure was also not diagnosed, and the patient's CK-MB levels were within the normal range, ruling out significant recent heart muscle damage."
146,1,13505645,What does the patient's white blood cell count indicate about the progression of her condition during the stay?,The patient's white blood cell count showed a concerning increase during the stay.,The patient's white blood cell count remained quite stable throughout the stay.,"The patient's white blood cell count declined, indicating a potential improvement in the patient's condition.","On admission, the patient's white blood cell count was dangerously high.",The patient's white blood cell count fluctuated wildly during the stay.,C,"The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count at the time of admission was slightly elevated at 11.5, but it decreased to 6.2 during her stay, as seen in the 'Brief Hospital Course' section of the notes. This decrease in WBC count can indicate an improvement in the patient's condition as it often signifies a reduction in inflammation or infection. The other option answers are incorrect but serve as good distractors. For instance, choice A is incorrect since the WBC decreased, not increased; choice B is wrong as there was a clear change in the WBC count; choice D is distractor as the WBC count was elevated but not dangerously high; and choice E is incorrect as the WBC count did not fluctuate wildly but showed a consistent decrease."
147,1,10755497,What was the patient's main presenting issue and how was it managed during her hospital stay according to the discharge summary dated 2175-11-21?,The patient was experiencing anxiety due to a recent breakup and her condition was managed by regular psychiatric evaluations and medication adjustment.,The patient was having physical symptoms due to excessive alcohol consumption and she was treated with detoxification methods and counseling.,"The patient was dealing with suicidal thoughts because of academic stress, and her condition was managed by offering emotional support and conducting group therapy sessions.",The patient was dealing with a new diagnosis of mood disorder and was treated with psychotherapy and stress management counseling.,The patient was having symptoms related to her recent miscarriage and she was treated with surgical intervention and pain management medications.,A,"According to the discharge summary, the patient had a mood disorder and was dealing with intense emotional turmoil after a breakup. This resulted in an incident involving alcohol and potential suicidal behavior, which led to her hospitalization. During her stay, she was under psychiatric care with regular evaluations and her medication was adjusted, changing from Xanax to Ativan. Other options refer to the patient's conditions (such as excessive alcohol consumption, academic stress, a new diagnosis of mood disorder, and the recent miscarriage), however, these were not the main reasons for her admission or how her condition was managed during the stay."
148,1,15480536,"What were the surgical procedures performed during the admission, and what were the primary reasons for their need?",The patient underwent a colonoscopy due to persistent abdominal and flank pain.,The patient had a renal graft surgery to manage the kidney stone problem.,A cystoscopy and a left ureteral stent placement were performed to combat the symptomatic ureteral obstruction.,A cardiac stent placement was done due to the hypertension the patient is suffering from.,Vasectomy was performed as part of the recurrent testicular problem.,C,"The correct answer is ""C"". According to the discharge summary, the patient was dealt with a cystoscopy and a left ureteral stent placement due to symptomatic ureteral obstruction from large left renal stones. Answer ""A"" is incorrect because there is no mention of the patient undergoing a colonoscopy, and the abdominal discomfort likely relates to the renal stones. Answer ""B"" is incorrect because there is no discussion of a renal graft. Answer ""D"" is incorrect because the summary doesn't mention a cardiac stent. Though the patient has hypertension, it is not the primary issue in this admission. Answer ""E"" is incorrect as the vasectomy was part of the patient's past surgical history, not the procedures performed in this hospital admission."
149,1,12735382,What is the patient's allergy information as recorded in the discharge summary charted on 2142-08-05?,Allergic to lasix and prilosec,Patients allergic to Penicillins and Morphine,Allergic to Fluoxetine and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen,Patients allergic to Atorvastatin and Docusate Sodium,Allergic to Insulin Glargine and Tolterodine ,B,"The correct answer is B because in the discharge summary under the section titled 'Allergies' it is stated that the patient is allergic to Penicillins and Morphine. Therefore, all other options are incorrect as they list medications that the patient takes and not ones they are allergic to. A, C, D, and E are good distractors because they confuse the question of allergies with medications that the patient is taking. It is important to understand that just because a patient is taking a medication does not mean they're not allergic to it."
150,1,17766160,Has the patient experienced any previous hospital admissions or surgical interventions prior to the acute appendicitis and the associated laparoscopic appendectomy based on the discharge summary written on 2165-02-19?,The patient has undergone multiple surgical procedures in the past.,The patient has never been previously admitted to a hospital or undergone any surgical procedures.,The patient had been hospitalized for a similar abdominal issue earlier.,The patient has had previous appendectomies.,The patient has a history of multiple hospital admissions due to acute appendicitis.,B,"According to the discharge summary, under 'Past Medical History' and 'Past Surgical History', both state that the patient ""denies"" having any known previous medical conditions or surgical interventions. Hence, it is clear that the patient has had no previous hospital admissions or surgical interventions prior to this incident of acute appendicitis and the associated laparoscopic appendectomy.   Choices A, C, D, and E are incorrect as they directly contradict this information and instead suggest that the patient has a history of previous hospital admissions or surgeries, which is not supported by the discharge summary. However, these options are plausible distractors because they relate to the topic of hospital admissions and surgical history, which is the main theme in the question."
