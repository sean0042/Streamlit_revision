1,1,16126307,What potential factors could have contributed to the patient's cardiac arrest?,The patient was experiencing heart palpitations.,The patient contracted E.coli bacteriuria prior to his arrest.,The patient had a history of severe pulmonary edema.,The patient had a history of severe Aortic stenosis and three vessel disease.,The patient had a high glucose level in the blood.,D,"The correct answer is D, ""The patient had a history of severe Aortic stenosis and three vessel disease."" It is mentioned in the discharge summary that the patient had a known history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and three-vessel coronary artery disease (3VD), both of which could have contributed to the patient's cardiac arrest.   Option A is incorrect because there is no report of heart palpitations in the discharge summary. The term ""heart palpitations"" is not used in the discharge summary, making this a good distractor.   Option B is incorrect. Although the patient did contract E.coli bacteriuria prior to his arrest, there's no clear link between this condition and cardiac arrest, making this a plausible but incorrect distractor.   Option C is incorrect because there's no mention of pulmonary edema in the patient's history or symptoms. The term ""pulmonary edema"" does not appear in the given note, thus it's a good distractor.  Option E is incorrect. Even though the patient had a high glucose level, it is not typically a direct risk factor for cardiac arrest. This makes option E a plausible, but incorrect distractor."
2,1,17995708,"What was found in the level of neutrophils and platelets in the patient's blood on the day of discharge, and what might these levels suggest about his health status at the time of discharge?","The patient showed an increased white blood cell count, indicating poor health status.","The patient showed a high hematocrit level, suggesting dehydration.","The patient showed a decreased level of neutrophils and platelets, suggesting potential infection or injury.","The patient showed a high level of creatinine, suggesting kidney disease.","The patient showed a high level of glucose, indicating the possibility of diabetes.",C,"The discharge summary shows a decreased level of neutrophils and platelets in the patient's blood, which could suggest an infection (stemming from the necrotic toe) or injury. Further, it could also indicate possible health conditions like cancer or an autoimmune disease. Option A is incorrect as the patient's white blood cell count is not increased. Option B is not apt as the patient's hematocrit level is not high. Option D is incorrect because the patient's creatinine level is not elevated. Option E is not suitable as the patient's glucose level is not high."
3,1,11419951,What were the abnormal findings of the Echocardiogram prior to Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting?,There was no evidence of any issues in the Echocardiogram.,The Echocardiogram reported thickened mitral valve leaflets along with findings of mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.,"According to the Echocardiogram, the patient had lower extremity diabetic neuropathy.",The Echocardiogram revealed a history of heart murmur.,"According to the Echocardiogram, the patient's blood glucose level was 189.",B,"The correct response is found in the results of the Echocardiogram in the discharge summary, which states that the mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened and there was mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. This means that the mitral valve doesn't close tightly enough, allowing blood to flow backward in the heart. Note that whilst other answer choices are present in the discharge summary, they don't directly answer the doctor's question about the Echocardiogram's abnormal findings prior to the Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting. For instance, option C highlights 'Lower extremity diabetic neuropathy' but this is an unrelated medical condition, whilst option D takes 'history of heart murmur' out of context as it wasn't an abnormal finding in the Echocardiogram done prior to surgery.   Option A is wrong as the summary clearly shows abnormalities. Option E is incorrect because it misinterprets clinical lab values as Echocardiogram findings, while the Echocardiogram primarily visualizes structural characteristics and motion of the heart."
4,1,15820880,What was the final diagnosis of the patient and what were the key findings in the diagnostic tests which led to this conclusion?,"The patient was diagnosed with a bacterial infection, observations made were punctate parenchymal hyperdensities and hypodensities on a CT head scan.","The patient was diagnosed with central nervous system infection, observations of abnormal vital signs, symptoms of fever and headache were noted.","The patient was diagnosed with viral syndrome, with a clear Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) result, normal Brain MRI, absence of meningitis or endocarditis and negative blood culture test.",The patient was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage as shown in the CT scan revealing a left frontal hyperdensity.,The patient was diagnosed with endocarditis as evidenced by an abnormal Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE).,C,"The final diagnosis of the patient was viral syndrome as indicated in the discharge summary. Key indications leading to this diagnosis were the negative results for a central nervous system infection, evident from the essentially normal MRI brain scan and the CSF fluid test that was inconsistent with meningitis. Furthermore, blood cultures and tests showed no growth of any pathogens. The TTE did not show any evidence for endocarditis, further ruling that condition out. Options A and D fail as the initial CT scan findings were revised with further testing. Although option B correctly identifies symptoms, it fails to take into account the results of the patient's tests. Lastly, option E is incorrect as the TTE found no evidence of endocarditis. However, all these distractions are effective as they all contain information found within the discharge summary and might be misunderstood to be the cause of the patient's condition."
5,1,17670977,"What was the infection identified in the patient, and what treatment plan was followed for the patient during his hospital stay and after discharge?",The patient was diagnosed with a respiratory infection and was treated with a course of ampicillin-sulbactam.,The patient was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and was managed with a continuous course of pravastatin.,The patient was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was treated with ceftriaxone during his stay and switched to ciprofloxacin upon discharge.,The patient was diagnosed with benign prostate hypertrophy and was managed with tamsulosin.,The patient was diagnosed with gout and was managed with a continuous course of allopurinol.,C,"According to the given discharge summary, the diagnosed infection was a urinary tract infection caused by E. Coli and it was treated with ceftriaxone during the hospital stay. The treatment was switched to ciprofloxacin upon discharge with a total course of 7 days. The other options are incorrect as they either refer to a different condition the patient has (hyperlipidemia, benign prostate hypertrophy, gout) or mention a treatment (ampicillin-sulbactam) which was not used for the main infection that caused the hospital stay. Although they are good distractors as they all refer to information contained within the discharge summary."
6,1,19374531,"What was the cause of the transaminitis noticed in the patient during their hospital stay, and did their transaminase levels trend down prior to discharge?",The transaminitis in the patient was a result of nicotine withdrawal and their transaminase levels remained elevated throughout the hospital stay.,"Head trauma caused the transaminitis in the patient, and there was a slight decrease in transaminase levels prior to discharge.","The patient's atrial fibrillation led to the transaminitis, but there was no change in transaminase levels before their discharge.","The patient's transaminitis was due to their acute alcohol intake, with transaminase levels falling slightly before discharge.","The transaminitis in the patient was due to their hypoglycemia, and their transaminase levels increased before discharge.",D,"The patient's history showed acute alcohol intake, which most likely caused the elevated transaminase levels (transaminitis). The records indicate that transaminase levels were elevated (ALT 90, AST 77) initially but decreased (ALT 50, AST 37) prior to discharge.   Option A is incorrect as nicotine withdrawal doesn't typically lead to transaminitis, and transaminase levels slightly lowered before the patient's discharge. Option B is wrong because the head trauma would not typically cause transaminitis, and transaminase levels decreased. Option C is incorrect because atrial fibrillation doesn't usually cause transaminitis, and the transaminase levels slightly reduced before discharge. Option E is incorrect since hypoglycemia wouldn't typically cause transaminitis and transaminase levels decreased. All incorrect options are good distractors because they refer to health issues presented in the patient's history."
7,1,15568838,"What was the major surgical or invasive procedure performed on the patient during her hospital stay, and what was the resultant diagnosis based on the biopsy performed?",The patient underwent a colonscopy which resulted in a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica.,The patient underwent a colonoscopy which resulted in a diagnosis of severe diffuse mucosal erythema.,The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy which resulted in a diagnosis of moderate active colitis.,The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy which resulted in a diagnosis of acute infectious colitis.,The patient underwent an endoscopy which resulted in a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma.,C,"The discharge summary notes that the patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy as a major surgical or invasive procedure during this hospital stay. The results from the biopsies derived from this procedure indicated a diagnosis of moderate active colitis. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect, but they are good distractors as they represent other procedures and diagnoses mentioned in the patient's medical history or the discharge summary. The patient did indeed have a colonoscopy, however, this was done before the hospital admission, making option A and B incorrect. A diagnosis of acute infectious colitis was one of the considerations but not the final diagnosis, rendering option D incorrect. Endoscopy was not performed during the hospital stay, making option E incorrect. Additionally, a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, while listed in the patient's medical history, was not related to the surgical procedure performed this hospital stay."
8,1,10546120,What was the presenting symptom of the patient's myocardial infarction and what medical intervention was carried out to address it?,The patient presented with neck pain and was treated with a flu vaccination.,The patient presented with abdominal pain and was given medication.,The patient presented with back pain and underwent Cardiac catheterization with BMS to LCx.,The patient presented with chest pain and was put on bed rest.,The patient presented with headaches and was treated with regular aspirin.,C,"As per the discharge summary, the patient's chief complaint was back pain which was the symptom associated with myocardial infarction. The medical intervention that was done was the cardiac catheterization with Bare Metal Stent (BMS) to Left Circumflex (LCx) which was totally occluded. Answer C rightly captures this information. Other options are incorrect but are potential distractors as they combine various information from the patient’s history and discharge summary (neck pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, and headaches) with various treatments, none of which correlate directly to the patient’s presenting condition (myocardial infarction) or the treatment carried out for it (cardiac catheterization)."
9,1,12121987,What is the most probable cause of the patient's diarrhea as analyzed by the doctor during her admission?,The diarrhea is due to a bacterial infection.,Medication related side-effects led to the diarrheal condition.,A viral infection is the most probable cause of diarrhea.,Diarrhea is resulting from the patient's diverticulosis condition.,The patient's recent laryngitis has led to diarrhea.,C,"According to the discharge summary, ""in the setting of chills, weakness, and a recent laryngitis, her diarrhea was likely infectious in etiology. Given lack of fever or leukocytosis, a viral etiology was suspected over an acute bacterial infection."" Option A is incorrect as the document suggests a viral, not a bacterial infection. Option B is excluded because the discharge summary does not attribute the diarrhea to medication side-effects. Option D is incorrect; while the patient does have diverticulosis, the document specifically identifies an infectious cause, likely viral, for the diarrhea. Option E is incorrect because, although the patient had recent laryngitis, the discharge summary does not suggest it as the cause of the diarrhea. Hence the correct answer is C."
10,1,12340336,What was the complication that occurred during the patient's pulmonary vein ablation as indicated in the discharge summary and how was it treated?,"The patient experienced hyperglycemia, which was managed by increasing the dosage of Flecainide.","The patient had hypotension resulting from cardiac tamponade, which was treated through fluid drainage.","The patient developed an umbilical hernia, which was treated with laparoscopic surgery.","The patient suffered from an allergic reaction due to Penicillins, and was treated with antihistamines.","The patient experienced worsening atrial fibrillation, managed by cardioversion.",B,"As indicated in the discharge summary, during the pulmonary vein ablation procedure, the patient suffered from complications including LV perforation, pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, and hypotension. This was treated by draining approximately 500cc of fluid from around the heart. The other choices, while mentioned in the discharge summary, are not directly related to the complication suffered during the pulmonary vein ablation procedure. Therefore, they are the incorrect options, but good distractors as they reference conditions present or treatments used in the patient's care."
11,1,12429883,"What was the surgical intervention performed on the patient after he suffered a syncopal fall resulting in specific facial fractures, and how was his condition during discharge?",The patient underwent open reduction surgery for a series of small bone fractures in his jaw after his fall and was in critical condition at the time of discharge.,The patient was treated with a series of radiation therapies to manage the damage from his fall and left the hospital in a stable condition.,The patient had an open reduction and internal fixation of the left parasymphysis fracture along with a closed reduction with maxillomandibular fixation of bilateral subcondylar fractures and was in good health during discharge.,The patient was administered medication for the fractures without surgical intervention and was in severe pain at the time of discharge.,The patient underwent surgery for a broken clavicle resulting from the fall and was unable to move at the time of discharge.,C,"Answer choice C correctly recaps the surgical procedure performed on the patient, with minor paraphrasing to avoid copying phrase verbatim from the notes. The notes clearly state that the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation for his fractures. Also at the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile, and with stable vital signs, which aligns with the description in answer C. The other answers, while borrowing some details from the discharge summary, either incorrectly describe the procedure or misrepresent the patient's condition at discharge."
12,1,12852043,What were the patient's laboratory results regarding his troponin and CK-MB on the date of admission and discharge?,"On admission, the troponin level was 10 and CK-MB was 20; on discharge, the troponin level was 15 and CK-MB was 30.",The patient's troponin and CK-MB were both 25 at admission and unchanged at discharge.,"The troponin level at admission was 0.08 and CK-MB was 15; at discharge, the troponin level was 0.07 and CK-MB was 13.","The CK-MB on admission was 0.08 and troponin was 15; on discharge, the CK-MB was 0.07 and troponin was 13.",Troponin was 0.08 at admission and 0.07 at discharge while CK-MB was 20 at admission and 15 at discharge.,C,"The discharge summary indicated that the patient's troponin level at admission was 0.08 and whereas the troponin level at discharge was 0.07. Furthermore, the patient's CK-MB level at admission was 15 whereas the CK-MB at discharge was 13. All the other choices contain wrong numbers or measures which were not indicated in the discharge summary as a record of the patient's laboratory results."
13,1,11777504,What were the main cardiovascular issues for this patient and how were they addressed during the hospital admission?,The patient primarily struggled with high blood pressure and was placed on a regimen of antihypertensives.,Surgeons successfully implemented a pacemaker to treat the patient's diagnosed arrhythmias.,The main disorder was hyperlipidemia and the patient was treated with lipid-lowering medications.,"The patient's significant heart problem was aortic stenosis, addressed by aortic valve replacement surgery.",Constriction of the patient's coronary arteries was managed through a stenting procedure.,D,"The core cardiovascular issues observed in this patient, as outlined in the discharge summary, were aortic stenosis and post-operative atrial fibrillation. Aortic stenosis was the primary issue and was addressed through an aortic valve replacement procedure (a 19mm Magna Ease tissue valve was used). After the surgery, the patient experienced post-operative atrial fibrillation, which was managed through medication (PO Amiodarone). Option A is incorrect as high blood pressure isn't mentioned as a significant concern for this patient during hospitalization. Option B is also not accurate because there's no reference to a pacemaker being implemented in the patient. Likewise, Hyperlipidemia (Option C) was a secondary condition and wasn't the primary cardiovascular issue. Lastly, Option E is incorrect as the patient did not undergo a stenting procedure during the hospital admission, making all these options good distractors."
14,1,16269651,What key surgical intervention was performed on the patient during the most recent hospital visit?,The patient underwent a colectomy.,The patient had a prostate cancer resection.,The patient underwent a repair of incarcerated ventral hernia.,The patient had an operation for an ileostomy.,The patient was treated for an attempted ventral hernia repair.,C,"Within the provided discharge summary, it is noted under 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' that the patient underwent a 'Repair of incarcerated ventral hernia'. This procedure matches with the context of the hospital visit and the surgical intervention discussed throughout the note.  Choice A is incorrect because the patient underwent a colectomy as a part of his past surgical history, not during this recent visit. Choice B is also wrong because the prostate cancer resection part of his past surgical history and isn't the surgical intervention performed during this most recent visit. Choice D isn't correct because the patient's ileostomy operation is also part of his past surgical history and it isn't the intervention performed on this recent hospital visit. Choice E isn't correct as the 'attempted ventral hernia repair' was a past procedure, not a part of the current hospital visit. The correct surgical intervention that was performed during the most recent visit was the 'Repair of incarcerated ventral hernia'."
15,1,14680555,What is the patient's primary diagnosis and how was it managed during hospitalization?,"The patient's primary diagnosis is Asthma, which was managed by continuing on home treatment of Theophylline, Fluticasone, Salmeterol, and Albuterol.",The patient's primary diagnosis is Hypertension which was handled by withholding Hydrochlorothiazide and Lisinopril initially and then restarting Lisinopril during hospitalization.,"The patient's primary diagnosis is internal hemorrhoids, which were managed by discontinuing NSAIDs, administering stool softener and hydrocortisone suppositories furthermore instruct outpatient follow-up.",The patient's primary diagnosis is Osteoarthritis which was managed by discontinuing Naproxen due to concerns of GI bleed and managing pain with Tylenol.,The patient's primary diagnosis is Obesity which was not managed during hospitalization.,C,"The patient's primary diagnosis is 'internal hemorrhoids' as mentioned in the 'Discharge Diagnosis' section. This condition was managed by discontinuing NSAIDs, administering stool softener and hydrocortisone suppositories, and instructing the patient to follow-up as an outpatient to ensure that blood count remains stable. Other options such as Asthma, Hypertension, Osteoarthritis, and Obesity are also  patient's conditions but are not the 'primary' diagnosis and the management related to each of them are not the primary form of management during this hospitalization."
16,1,11626031,What was the treatment received by the patient for his MSSA infection noticed in his urine and pneumonia?,The patient was given oral antibiotics post discharge for the MSSA found in his urine.,Antibiotics were discontinued post discharge after successful treatment of the MSSA infection in the urine.,The patient was given a course of intravenous antibiotics to treat the MSSA infection.,The patient refused all treatment options provided for the MSSA infection.,The MSSA infection in the patient's urine was treated using natural home remedies.,B,"The patient was indeed treated for his MSSA infection found in urine and pneumonia caused presumably by aspiration. The treatment involved a course of intravenous antibiotics - initially with vancomycin, which got switched to cefazolin when the culture data returned. The patient completed an 8-day course of these antibiotics. However, at discharge, no additional antibiotics were administered as it was decided to have the patient closely monitored post discharge. The treatment was deemed successful. All the other options are not correct as they incorrectly describe the treatment the patient received; but they serve as good distractors as they suggest plausible but incorrect methods of treatment."
17,1,11556950,"What are the differential diagnosis considered for the patient's symptoms of persistent fevers, elevated LFTs, and cervical lymphadenopathy?",Hepatitis A Virus infection,HIV infection,Hemangioma formation,"Epstein-Barr Virus, Cytomegalovirus, or Toxoplasmosis infections",Lyme disease infection,D,"The discharge summary reports thorough testing for multiple infections, including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Toxoplasmosis, as potential causes for the patient's symptoms, making choice D the correct answer. On the other hand, Hepatitis A (choice A) was part of the patient's past medical history but is no longer active, as indicated by negative HAV IgM results. HIV infection (choice B) was considered but has a low suspicion due to the patient's social history. Imagery shows hemangiomas but these are benign and typically don't cause the presented symptoms, making choice C incorrect. Lastly, Lyme disease (choice E) was ruled out as part of the initial infectious workup."
18,1,14018478,What was the patient's ejection fraction according to the Echocardiography report and how does it relate to the normal range?,The patient's ejection fraction was in the range of 50% to 60% and it is considered within the normal range.,The ejection fraction was found to be between 55% and 70% and is regarded as normal.,The patient's ejection fraction was determined to be 60% to 75% which indicates a significant improvement over the normal range.,The patient's ejection fraction ranged from 40% to 50% which is below the normal range.,The ejection fraction was in the 70% to 80% range and is considered above the normal level.,B,"The echocardiography report indicates that the patient's ejection fraction was between 60% and 70%, which falls within the normal range of >= 55%. Option A is incorrect because the ejection fraction wasn't between 50% and 60%. Option C is incorrect because the ejection fraction wasn't between 60% and 75%, and this would not normally indicate an improvement over the normal range. Option D is incorrect because the ejection fraction wasn't between 40% and 50% and this is lower than the normal range. Option E is incorrect because the ejection fraction wasn't between 70% and 80% and this would indicate levels above a normal range."
19,1,16876756,"What are the patient's primary clinical issues as mentioned in the discharge summary, and what are her current medications upon discharge?",The patient is diagnosed with colon polyp and is on Oxycodone & Cefadroxil.,The patient faces hypertension and is prescribed Amitriptyline & Fluconazole.,"The patient has a new primary of the left breast and is taking Aspirin, Cefadroxil, Docusate Sodium, Gabapentin, Lisinopril, Oxycodone, Temazepam, and Triamterene-HCTZ.",The patient suffers from Melanoma and is undergoing therapy with Prednisone & Methotrexate.,The patient has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia for which Plavix & Atorvastatin has been prescribed.,C,"The patient's primary clinical issues as indicated in the discharge summary are Left Breast Cancer and a new primary of the left breast. The medications listed for this patient upon discharge are Aspirin, Cefadroxil, Docusate Sodium, Gabapentin, Lisinopril, Oxycodone, Temazepam, and Triamterene-HCTZ (Option C). Option A mistakenly identifies the patient's primary issue as colon polyp, which the patient does have a history of but it's not the primary diagnosis currently. Options B, D and E are incorrect as they list different ailments and medications that are not being issued to the patient according to the discharge summary."
20,1,19411951,What interventions were taken in regards to the patient's coronary artery disease during his hospital stay?,The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and went through a resulting bypass surgery.,The patient experienced coronary artery stenosis as a result and was treated with a stent placement.,"The patient was given medication alone, without any surgical interventions.","The patient had a cardiac catheterization followed by the placement of an intraaortic balloon pump, and was kept on medication.",The patient adopted lifestyle changes as part of the intervention process but did not undergo any surgical procedures during his stay.,D,"The correct answer is D because as stated in the patient's discharge summary, he underwent a successful cardiac catheterization which revealed severely diseased and occluded grafts and vessels. Following chest pain after the procedure, the patient was not considered a candidate for subsequent bypass surgery, leading to the placement of an intraaortic balloon pump. He was also kept on a heparin gtt, integrilin and a nitro gtt for pain management.  Answer A is incorrect as the patient was not considered a suitable candidate for bypass surgery following the catheterization. Answer B is untrue as the summary does not indicate any stenosis or stent placement for the patient. Answer C is not completely true because, despite the patient being on medication, he also underwent a cardiac catheterization and had a balloon pump placed in him as part of interventions. Answer E is also incorrect as there is no mention of the patient adopting lifestyle changes as a step to counter his disease during his hospital stay."
21,1,11189567,What were the patient's lab results on admission and findings from the echocardiogram?,"The patient had a high WBC count of 12.5, and the echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular hypertrophy.",The patient had an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 and the echocardiogram indicated moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.,"The patient's troponin level was at 5.14, and the echocardiogram found trivial tricuspid regurgitation and severe aortic valve stenosis.","The patient showed a normal HbA1c level of 6.5%, with the echocardiogram reporting decreased global longitudinal strain.","The glucose level in the patient's blood was low at 50, and the echocardiogram revealed signs of diastolic dysfunction with elevated PCWP.",B,"From the discharge summary, we learned that the patient’s lab results on admission showed an elevated Creatinine level (1.7). The echocardiogram showed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Other choices mentioned contain incorrect information or issues that weren't observed during the echocardiogram. Hence, only option B is the right answer."
22,1,19486422,"What is the patient's breast cancer staging (T, N, M classification) and the current treatment regimen, according to her discharge summary from her hospital visit on 2130-10-13?","Stage II (T1c, N1, Mx), treated with weekly Taxol and Herceptin following 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan","Stage IV (T3, N2, Mx), receiving weekly Taxol and Herceptin after 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan","Stage I (T1c, N0, Mx), going through weekly Taxol and Herceptin treatments after 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan","Stage II (T2, N1, M0), treated with Adriamycin and Cytoxan, followed by weekly Taxol and Herceptin","Stage I (T1c, N0, M0), on Adriamycin and Cytoxan, now under Taxol and Herceptin each week",C,"The patient's discharge summary indicates that her breast cancer is classified as Stage I (T1c, N0, Mx). This is evident from the phrase: ""Patient has stage I (T1c, N0, Mx) grade III invasive ductal carcinoma"". She is currently on a treatment regimen of weekly Taxol and Herceptin following 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan, stated as ""s/p 4 cycles of dose dense Adriamycin and Cytoxan. She is now getting weekly Taxol and Herceptin"". Despite all other answers containing text from the discharge note, they either misrepresent the stage of the cancer or the treatment regimen, thus they are distractors."
23,1,16420623,What were the findings from the colonoscopy procedure performed during the patient's stay at the hospital?,The colonoscopy revealed the presence of polyps which were removed.,The colonoscopy detected severe colorectal inflammation and ulceration.,The colonoscopy found mild colitis with erythema and petechiae in the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon.,A full examination of the cecum and terminal ileum was conducted during the colonoscopy.,The colonoscopy related evidence of rectal bleeding or hemorrhoids.,C,"Based on the discharge summary, the colonoscopy procedure performed during the patient's stay at the hospital showed evidence of mild colitis as there was erythema and petechiae in the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon (Choice C).   Choice A is incorrect because there is no mention of polyps being detected or removed during the colonoscopy. Choice B is also wrong as the colonoscopy findings did not indicate severe inflammation and ulceration. It was mild colitis. Choice D is incorrect because the colonoscopy couldn't examine the cecum and terminal ileum due to poor prep. Finally, choice E is incorrect because there was no evidence of rectal bleeding or hemorrhoids mentioned in the colonoscopy findings during the patient's hospital stay."
24,1,17005513,What abnormal laboratory finding was recorded on admission for the patient and what potential causes were identified for this during the patient's hospital stay?,The patient was detected with hypokalemia possibly instigated by dehydration and various medication effects.,The patient tested positive for Calcium deficiency likely due to lack of dietary intake.,"The patient indicated elevations in blood glucose levels, most possibly linked to unregulated diabetes.","The patient had a high reading on the TSH test, suggesting probable underlying hypothyroidism.","The patient showed hypernatremia, potentially attributed to excessive sodium intake.",A,"Based on the information in the discharge summary, upon admission, the patient was found to have hypokalemia (potassium deficiency) as stated in the lab results. Potential causes mentioned for this conditioning includes a lack of adequate nutrition in combination with the effects of a diuretic the patient was taken. The other options presented are not supported by the summaries contents. Though the patient's TSH levels were monitored, the results were not abnormal. Elevated blood glucose levels, calcium deficiency, or hypernatremia were not found in the patient's lab tests. Hence, choices B, C, D, and E, though reflecting terms mentioned in the discharge summary, are not valid answers to the question."
25,1,12947494,What was the underlying cause of the patient's hypernatremia and how was it managed during the hospital stay?,The patient's hypernatremia was due to hypertension. Management involved administering isotonic fluid boluses and D5W.,The patient's hypernatremia was due to pneumonia. Management involved therapy and antibiotics.,The patient's hypernatremia resulted from diabetes. It was managed with insulin therapy.,The patient's hypernatremia was due to limited oral intake and limited access to free water. The management involved isotonic fluid boluses and D5W to restore free water deficit.,The patient's hypernatremia was due to Alzheimer's disease. Management involved cognitive therapy.,D,"The patient's hypernatremia was caused by poor oral intake and limited access to free water due to immobility. Infection could have also exacerbated his condition by increasing insensible water losses. The hypernatremia was managed by initially administering isotonic fluid boluses and, after volume resuscitation, giving D5W to replenish the free water deficit. Other options are incorrect but good distractors because they mention other conditions from which the patient was suffering (e.g., hypertension, pneumonia, Alzheimer's disease), or diseases not mentioned in the patient's history at all (e.g., diabetes), but none of these conditions were cited as causing the patient's hypernatremia."
26,1,19846723,What was the primary diagnosis for the patient's admission in the hospital as recorded on 2184-03-24?,The patient was primarily admitted for treatment of hypertension (HTN).,The patient was primarily admitted for treatment of a nervous breakdown.,The patient was primarily admitted due to complications with hyperlipidemia.,The patient was primarily admitted due to diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia.,The patient was primarily admitted for knee surgery.,D,"The primary diagnosis for the patient's admission to the hospital on 2184-03-24, as mentioned in the discharge summary, was community-acquired pneumonia. Options A, B, C, and E, although reflective of the patient's medical condition, are not the primary reason for the patient's admission on this date."
27,1,11386416,What diagnostic imaging modalities were used to evaluate this patient's symptoms and what were the findings?,A sinus X-ray was performed which revealed fluid in the nasal cavity.,"The patient underwent an MRI of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic and lumbar spine and a CT scan of the head. Both revealed no definite focal lesions indicative of a demyelinating process, though a small- to moderate-sized protrusion was present at C5-6 level on the cervical spine.",The patient had a lumbar puncture that indicated the presence of 1 Red Blood Cell and 1 White Blood Cell with normal levels of protein and glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).,"An ultrasound of the abdomen was done, showing no significant abnormalities.","A mammogram was performed that revealed a small, benign mass in the right breast.",B,"Information in the provided note shows that the patient had an MRI of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic and lumbar spine and a CT scan of the head. The MRI of the brain showed no definite focal lesions suggestive of a demyelinating process. The MRI of the cervical spine revealed the reversal of cervical lordosis and multilevel degenerative disease, most pronounced from C4-6. The MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine was normal apart from a focal lesion in the T11 vertebral body and a small right-sided L5-S1 disc protrusion. The CT scan of the head was reportedly done at an emergency department, which was reportedly negative except for ""fluid in the nasal cavity."" This makes option B the correct answer.   Option A is incorrect as there is no mention in the note of a sinus X-ray. Option C is only partially correct, the lumbar puncture (a type of diagnostic procedure, not imaging) did reveal the presence of 1 RBC and 1 WBC but it doesn't give a complete picture of all the imaging modalities used in this patient's case. Option D and E are incorrect because the note does not mention that a mammogram or an ultrasound of the abdomen was performed on the patient."
28,1,14783413,"Given the patient's symptoms and abnormal stress test result, what findings were revealed by the cardiac catheterization completed during this hospitalization?",There was moderate tortuosity in the LAD.,The coronary circulation was right dominant.,Evidence of angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.,No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.,The Right Coronary Artery was small in caliber.,D,"The question is specifically asking about the findings from the cardiac catheterization, which is detailed in the notes. Only option D accurately summarizes information from these notes - namely that ""cath that showed no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease."" While options A, B, and E are factually accurate statements about the patient's coronary configuration, they don't answer the specific question about the findings from the cardiac catheterization. C is incorrect as no coronary artery disease was found in the catheterization. Hence, option D is the correct choice."
29,1,11870254,"Was postoperative oral anticoagulation indicated for the patient, and if not, what justification is provided in the discharge summary for not prescribing it?",Postoperative oral anticoagulation was not required due to the patient's normal sinus bradycardia.,Postoperative oral anticoagulation was not recommended as the patient experienced a brief episode of diplopia.,There was no need for postoperative oral anticoagulation as the patient was discharged with a short-term course of Amiodarone.,Postoperative oral anticoagulation was not needed as the patient has exertional dyspnea.,"Due to the patient's multiple sclerosis, postoperative oral anticoagulation was not used.",C,"The patient experienced a brief episode of atrial fibrillation post-operation but it was short-lived and self-correcting, hence the discharge summary notes that he will not require anticoagulation upon discharge. The course of amiodarone discharged was sufficient. Options A, B, D, and E are not accurate as sinus bradycardia, diplopia, exertional dyspnea, and multiple sclerosis are not reasons to forego anticoagulation if it is indicated. In this case, it was not needed post-discharge."
30,1,18190937,What alterations were made to the patient's prescription medications before discharge?,The patient was prescribed a new medication to manage anxiety.,The usage of prednisone was halted entirely.,The dosage of Metoprolol was reduced and restricted for certain health situations.,The patient was directed to halt the use of Omeprazole.,The patient was directed to increase the dosage of Atorvastatin.,C,"As indicated in the discharge summary, the patient's dose of Metoprolol was reduced. Moreover, the patient was instructed to only take this medication if their systolic blood pressure was not less than 90 and their heart rate was not less than 55. The remaining options (A, B, D, and E) are incorrect because, according to the summary, no new anxiety medication was prescribed (A), Prednisone use was not halted entirely but was tapered off (B), the use of Omeprazole was continued (D), and there was no increase in the dosage of Atorvastatin (E). These options are, however, good distractors as all these medicines are mentioned in the patient's medication list."
31,1,16299664,What medications were initiated for the patient´s alcohol cravings and anxiety disorder during her hospital stay?,Folic Acid and Multivitamins,IV Ativan and Phenobarbital,Naltrexone and Sertraline,Nitrofurantoin and CefTRIAXone,Omeprazole and Gabapentin,C,"The patient was treated for alcohol cravings with Naltrexone and for generalized anxiety disorder with Sertraline during her hospital stay, as evident in the discharge summary. The distractors, Folic Acid and Multivitamins (A), IV Ativan and Phenobarbital (B), Nitrofurantoin and CefTRIAXone (D), and Omeprazole and Gabapentin (E) were also mentioned in the notes, but they were given not specifically for alcohol cravings or anxiety disorder but for other issues or as general supplements."
32,1,15328702,What was one of the main clinical manifestations the patient experienced during this hospital admission?,Patient had large amounts of bright red blood in their stools,The patient experienced extreme fever and chills due to a zit on his buttocks getting infected and causing severe pain,The patient had signs of syphilis and had to undergo Penicillin treatment,The patient had a lichen simplex but was not treated with steroid cream due to ineffectiveness,The patient had clotting issues due to low platelet count,B,"In the discharge summary, the physician notes that the patient has presented with right buttock pain and fevers for the past few days after the infection of a ""zit"" on his buttocks. This indicates that one of the main clinical manifestations the patient experienced during this admission was severe pain and fevers due to this infected zit (Choice B). Choice A is incorrect because, although there is a mention of bright red bloody discharge, it was specified that there was no pus. Choice C is irrelevant as the documentation notes that syphilis was a condition the patient had in the past and underwent treatment for. Choice D is incorrect because while the patient did have a lichen simplex, it was treated with steroid cream and zinc ointment, though ""to little effect"". However, it wasn't a main clinical manifestation during this hospital admission. Choice E can seem like a plausible answer as the patient had a slightly lower than baseline platelet count upon admission, however, it remained stable throughout the stay and the connection to the main clinical manifestation (severe buttock pain and fevers) was not clear."
33,1,10522614,What was the patient's primary psychiatric diagnosis upon discharge and what medications were prescribed to manage it?,"Upon discharge, the patient was diagnosed with Cluster B traits and was prescribed Trazodone and Folate.",The patient was diagnosed with Polysubstance Abuse and was prescribed Mirtazepine and Hydroxazine.,The patient was diagnosed with Opiate Dependence and was treated with Glyburide and Lispro Insulin.,"Upon discharge, the patient was diagnosed with Mood disorder NOS, Hepatitis C, and was given medication for diabetes, Glyburide.","The patient was diagnosed with NIDDM and prescribed Vistaril, Neurontin, and Paxil.",B,"According to the discharge diagnosis in the note, the patient's primary psychiatric diagnosis was Mood disorder NOS and Polysubstance Abuse. The medications prescribed to manage these conditions were Mirtazepine and Hydroxazine as per the 'Brief Hopsital Course' and 'Medications on Admission' sections in the note. Option A is incorrect because Cluster B traits were an Axis II diagnosis and not the primary psychiatric diagnosis, and Trazodone and Folate were not the prescribed medications on discharge. Option C is incorrect because Opiate Dependence was part of the diagnosis, but the medications listed are for diabetes, not the psychiatric condition. Option D mixes the psychiatric and medical diagnoses and the medication listed is for managing diabetes, not the mood disorder. Option E is entirely incorrect as NIDDM is a medical diagnosis, not a psychiatric one, and the listed medications were past trials, not the current prescription upon discharge."
34,1,15867280,What was the patient's heart condition and how was it treated during the admission?,Patient had been suffering from acute on chronic renal failure and it was resolved with diuretics.,Patient had an acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure which improved with the usage of diuretics and ionotropic medications.,Patient had non-ST elevation myocardial infarction which was relieved with aspirin and Plavix.,Patient was diagnosed with acute stroke and was treated with anticoagulants.,Patient had severe anemia which was managed by transfusion and iron supplementation.,B,"The patient was admitted due to congestive heart failure and associated myocardial infarction. From the notes it says 'acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure' and 'Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction.' Treatment comprised diuretics (Lasix drip with doses of Metolazone and diuril), ionotropic medications (digoxin and metoprolol), and cardiac interventions (drug-eluting stents). These are all directly related to managing the heart condition. Although the patient received aspirin and Plavix (option C), these medicines alone do not wholly describe the range of treatments administered for their heart condition. Other options, like anemia (option E) and renal failure (option A), were indeed conditions the patient had, but weren't the heart condition in question. The patient didn't have a stroke (option D)."
35,1,16077374,What information from the patient's history of present illness and past medical history contributed to the decision to managing the patient's acute on chronic kidney disease with hydration therapy?,"The patient had past medical history of chronic renal insufficiency and recurrent Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), complications from kidney stones and stent placement, which directly contributed to the fluctuations in the patient's creatinine levels.","The patient's allergy to Codeine, Shellfish, and Percocet was the main cause of her kidney disease.",The patient's hypertension was the reason for their acute on chronic kidney disease treatment.,The patient's history of breast cancer directly influenced the decision to manage her acute on chronic kidney disease.,The cerebral aneurysm and right eye blindness were the primary contributing factors for patient's kidney disease management.,A,"The answer choice A is correct because within the discharge note it is stated that the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease from calculi (kidney stones), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), and stent placement which directly affects her kidney function, specifically evidenced by fluctuating creatinine levels. Therefore, hydration therapy was implemented as part of the management strategy for the patient's chronic kidney disease. The other selections B, C, D, and E while part of the patient's medical history, do not directly explain why hydration therapy was chosen as the management strategy for this patient's acute on chronic kidney disease."
36,1,17250264,"What antibiotics was the patient prescribed upon discharge, and what was the duration of treatment advised?",The patient was prescribed Augmentin and Bactrim for a period of 7 days.,The patient was prescribed Ibuprofen and Lisinopril for a period of 10 days.,"The patient was prescribed Oxycodone-Acetaminophen and Lisinopril, till the completion of a 10 days course.",The patient was prescribed Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid and Sulfameth/Trimethoprim for a period of 10 days.,The patient was prescribed IV vanc/unasyn for an undefined duration.,D,"The correct choice is D, which mentions the patient was prescribed Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid and Sulfameth/Trimethoprim for a duration of 10 days, which can be deduced from the patient’s discharge instructions. Choice A incorrectly mentions Augmentin and Bactrim as the antibiotics prescribed at discharge and also suggests an incorrect duration of 7 days. Choice B lists Ibuprofen and Lisinopril, which were indeed part of the discharge medication but are not antibiotics. Choice C mentions Oxycodone-Acetaminophen along with Lisinopril for 10 days, which is incorrect as the former is a pain control medication. Choice E mentions IV vanc/unasyn, which were indeed administered during hospitalization, but not prescribed upon discharge."
37,1,16255570,What were the major procedures performed on the patient and what was the state of the patient upon discharge?,"The patient underwent aortic valve replacement and was discharged with a regular heart rate and rhythm, without murmurs.","The patient had a stent placement and at discharge, she was on medication for elevated blood pressure.","The major procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting on three parts with different methods and the patient was discharged in good condition, independently mobile, wound in healing process and pain managed with oral medications.",The patient has an emergency PCI for distal right coronary artery and discharged in a stable condition with regular medication management.,A catheterization procedure was done to manage chest pain and her discharge condition was managed with monitored vital signs and regular medication.,C,"The discharge summary highlights that the patient had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting x 3. The grafting details are explained as a left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein graft to the marginal branch and diagonal branch. From the summary it is clear that the patient was discharged in a good condition, able to walk independently, the wound was healing and pain was managed with oral analgesics. Even though other options like A, B, D, and E have contextually correct information that appears in the discharge summary but those are wrong answers to the question as those procedures weren't the major ones performed on the patient, and the state of the patient on discharge was not as described in those options."
38,1,10554333,What are the patient's symptoms and history that were presented during the neurological examination?,The patient complained of vision blackouts and black spots in vision.,"The patient suffered from dizziness, blurry vision, and chronic numbness and weakness on the right side.","Throughout the day, the patient experienced regular numbness in her left arm and leg along with persistent headaches different from her typical migraines.",The patient was extremely unoriented and struggled to relay her history.,The patient had been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain for the past few days.,C,"The correct answer is C. In the notes, it is mentioned that the patient had been dealing with dizziness, blurry vision, and numbness and weakness on the left side, which included her leg and arm. She also had headaches that were different from her typical migraines.   Option A is incorrect because the notes specify that the patient denies vision blackouts or black spots in vision.   Option B mentions chronic numbness and weakness on the right side, which is wrong since the patient was having them on her left side.  Option D explains the patient was unoriented, which is the opposite of the notes which express that she was alert and oriented and able to relate history without difficulty.  Lastly, option E is incorrect as the patient denied having shortness of breath and chest pain."
39,1,15946095,"What surgical procedures did the patient undergo for the treatment of their coronary artery disease as per the discharge summary of October 12, 2118?",The patient underwent angioplasty.,The patient had a pacemaker inserted.,The patient underwent threefold CABG.,The patient had a heart valve replacement.,The patient underwent a stent insertion.,C,"According to the patient discharge summary, the patient underwent a threefold Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG). This consisted of grafting the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, and another saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they are not mentioned in the surgical procedures conducted. However, these options were plausible distractors, as they are associated with the treatment of coronary artery disease."
40,1,10071435,What was the patient's discharge medications after the coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and what were the quantities prescribed for each medication?,"Ridonitidine 150 mg once a day, Furosemide 20 mg twice a day, Acetaminophen 2000 mg every six hours, and Aspirin EC 81 mg once a day.","Metoprolol 50 mg twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq every twelve hours, Ranitidine HCl 150 mg daily, and Lidocaine 5% Patch applied topically every evening.","Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg twice a day, Furosemide 20 mg twice a day, Potassium Chloride 10 mEq every twelve hours, and Aspirin EC 81 mg daily.","Acetaminophen IV every six hours for pain, Aspirin EC once a day, Potassium Chloride 10 mEq split twice a day, and Simvastatin 40 mg daily at bedtime.","Simvastatin 80 mg at bedtime, Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg split two times a day, Ranitidine HCl 150 mg daily, and Furosemide 20 mg twice a day.",C,"According to the 'discharge summary', the patient was prescribed with Acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 hours as needed for mild pain or fever, Furosemide 20 mg twice a day, Lidocaine 5% Patch applied once daily at bedtime, Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg twice a day, Potassium Chloride 10 mEq every 12 hours, Ranitidine 150 mg daily, Simvastatin 40 mg daily at bedtime, and aspirin EC 81 mg daily. Therefore, answer choice C encapsulates this list of medications, even though it misses out some. Answer A, B, D, and E include incorrect medication dosages and frequencies not according to the summary: A includes the wrong dosage for Acetaminophen and omits several; B includes the wrong dosage for Metoprolol and omits several; D includes IV for Acetaminophen which is not listed in the summary and misses several; E has the wrong dosage for Simvastatin and omits several. Thus, answer C stays to be the best choice even though it doesn't cover all."
41,1,19801123,What could be the potential cause of the patient's left upper extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and what therapy was proposed?,The DVT was caused by HCV and the recommended therapy is CefTRIAXone 2 gm IV Q 24H.,"The DVT was caused by opioid dependence and IVDU with recent injection drug use in that arm and the proposed therapy is Elevation, warm packs and Lovenox 1mg/kg q12.",The DVT was caused by Group B strep acute bloodstream infection/sepsis and the proposed therapy was Enoxaparin Sodium 50 mg SC Q12H.,The DVT was caused by the patient's 15 weeks pregnancy and the proposed therapy was prenatal vitamins.,The DVT was caused by aortic valve endocarditis and the proposed therapy is daily intake of Acetaminophen.,B,"From the summary, it's clear that the patient's usage of intravenous drugs is what led to the DVT. The aftermath of heroin injection in the left arm caused several complications including redness and swelling that hospital records indicates as cellulitis that ultimately led to a DVT. The therapy advised for this is Elevation of the affected limb, warm packs to alleviate pain and Lovenox, an anticoagulant, administered twice daily. Option A is incorrect because there is no direct connection between HCV and DVT in this case. Option C is incorrect because Group B strep, despite being present, is not indicated as the cause of DVT. In Option D, although pregnancy does contribute to DVT risk, it is not the direct cause in this particular case. Lastly, DVT is not caused by aortic valve endocarditis as indicated in Option E."
42,1,16780715,What is the assessment of the patient's left subclavian stenosis and aortic aneurysm observed in the CTA scan and what is the future course of action planned for these conditions?,The CTA showed moderate narrowing of the arteries to the arm and a significant aortic aneurysm. The patient is recommended to immediately undergo surgery for these conditions.,The CTA scan revealed minimal narrowing of the left subclavian artery and slight enlargement of the aortic arch. Medications have been prescribed to treat these conditions.,The CTA scan showed severe narrowing of the left subclavian artery and a substantial aortic aneurysm. The patient will be evaluated by vascular surgeons for possible future stenting.,The CTA scan revealed a large aortic aneurysm and significant narrowing of the right subclavian artery. The patient will follow up with vascular surgery for aortic stent grafting.,The CTA scan showed slight narrowing of the right subclavian artery and a small aortic aneurysm. Surgical intervention has been set in the immediate future.,C,"The CTA scan from the discharge summary revealed significant narrowing of the left subclavian artery (not right) and a large aortic aneurysm. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they either misreport the severity or the location of the conditions (left subclavian artery and aortic aneurysm), or they suggest incorrect action plans like immediate surgery or medication, which were not stated in the discharge notes. The discharge notes clearly indicate that the patient will have outpatient follow-up for evaluation of possible future stenting. Thus, even though options A and D both correctly report the diagnosed conditions, they nevertheless suggest immediate surgery, which is incorrect according to discharge instructions. Option C is therefore the correct answer."
43,1,16679284,What were the discharge medications prescribed for the patient and for what conditions these medications are generally used?,"Acetaminophen for high blood pressure, Bisacodyl for heart disease, Docusate Sodium for anxiety, Enoxaparin Sodium for high cholesterol, Oxycodone for depression, Hydrochlorothiazide for pain relief, Lorazepam for constipation, Paroxetine for preventing blood clots, Simvastatin for anxiety.","Acetaminophen for moderate pain relief, Bisacodyl for constipation, Docusate Sodium for constipation, Enoxaparin Sodium for preventing blood clots, Oxycodone for severe pain relief, Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, Lorazepam for anxiety, Paroxetine for depression, Simvastatin for high cholesterol.","Acetaminophen for high cholesterol, Bisacodyl for high blood pressure, Docusate Sodium for depression, Enoxaparin Sodium for anxiety, Oxycodone for preventing blood clots, Hydrochlorothiazide for pain relief, Lorazepam for hypertension, Paroxetine for constipation, Simvastatin for anxiety.","Acetaminophen for constipation, Bisacodyl for moderate pain relief, Docusate Sodium for severe pain relief, Enoxaparin Sodium for hypertension, Oxycodone for anxiety, Hydrochlorothiazide for depression, Lorazepam for high cholesterol, Paroxetine for preventing blood clots, Simvastatin for constipation.","Acetaminophen for severe pain relief, Bisacodyl for constipation, Docusate Sodium for hypertension, Enoxaparin Sodium for anxiety, Oxycodone for depression, Hydrochlorothiazide for high cholesterol, Lorazepam for preventing blood clots, Paroxetine for moderate pain relief, Simvastatin for anxiety.",B,"According to the information in the discharge summary, the patient was prescribed: Acetaminophen for moderate pain relief, Bisacodyl and Docusate Sodium for constipation, Enoxaparin Sodium to prevent blood clots, Oxycodone for severe pain relief, Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension management, Lorazepam for anxiety, Paroxetine for depression, and Simvastatin to control high cholesterol levels. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer. All other choices, although the cited medications match the patient's prescriptions, the corresponding conditions for their utilization don't align to the provided discharge summary."
44,1,15377769,What was the most likely cause of the patient's acute rise in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) upon admission and how were these levels affected by her treatment?,Liver damage due to the high levels of potassium in the patient's blood.,The patient's liver enzymes were likely elevated due to her chronic hypothyroidism.,The rise in liver enzymes was an effect of the patient's viral gastroenteritis.,"The patient's acute rise in liver enzymes was most likely due to hypotension experienced during her illness, further aggravated by her ongoing chronic liver disease. Improved blood pressure through treatment led to a downtrend in these levels.",The elevation was a side effect of the high doses of the steroid hydrocortisone administered during her treatment.,D,"Reviewing the discharge summary, the patient's acute rise in liver enzymes was notably tied to her state of hypotension - a lower-than-normal blood pressure - and her chronic liver disease history. This is aligned with choice ""D,"" marking it as the correct answer. The patient's condition experienced significant improvement following treatment that helped to stabilize her blood pressure, with notable downtrends in the liver enzyme levels. This excludes choices ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" and ""E"". While the decisions around her hypertension medicine, potassium levels, thyroid condition, metformin and hydrocortisone are present in the summary, these did not directly contribute to the initial rise in liver enzymes, making them incorrect but plausible distractors."
45,1,14607842,What is the dosage and schedule of the patient's chemotherapy regimen RVD and when was the last dose administered?,The patient is taking 20 mg of Dexamethasone daily,"The patient is taking Bortezomib 2.6 mg on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. The last dose was given on D5.","Lenalidomide is being administered daily for 10 days, and the treatment will resume on day 11.",The patient is taking HydroMorphine 2 mg every six hours.,The patient is taking Acyclovir 400 mg twice a day.,B,"Option B is the correct answer as it matches the chemotherapy regimen of RVD (Revlimid, Velcade, Dexamethasone). Option A is incorrect as it refers only to the Dexamethasone component of RVD, but not Bortezomib (Velcade) or Lenalidomide (Revlimid). Similarly, option C only refers to Lenalidomide, not the entire RVD regimen. Options D and E are referring to the patient's pain medication and anti-viral therapy, not her RVD regimen.  Note: Although option A and C mention individual components of the RVD regimen, none specify the full combination therapy in terms of dose and administration schedule as asked in the question. Only option B mentions Bortezomib (Velcade)'s dose and its deviation from the regular schedule, hence it's the correct answer."
46,1,14944522,What were the major factors contributing to the patient's acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure and how were they managed during the hospital stay?,"Recent movement led to worsening of chronic respiratory failure, managed through changes in physical activity.","Evidence of pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significant, treated through antibiotics and continuous oxygen therapy.","Confusion and memory loss caused respiratory deterioration, addressed through cognitive therapy.","Orthostatic hypotension played a major role, and was mitigated through fluid challenge.","Increase in blood counts led to respiratory impairment, managed through bone marrow biopsy.",B,"The patient's respiratory failure was significantly contributed by community-acquired pneumonia and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as indicated by her chest imaging revealing pneumonia and emphysematous changes (referenced in the hospital course). It was managed through a course of levofloxacin and azithromycin (antibiotics) and the patient was discharged with supplemental oxygen.   Option A is not a correct answer as the patient's movement or activity change wasn't linked to her respiratory issue. Option C is also incorrect as, although the patient had issues with confusion and memory loss, these conditions are not directly associated with respiratory failure. Option D states that orthostatic hypotension contributed to the respiratory failure which is incorrect. Although the patient has orthostatic hypotension, there is no medical correlation between this and respiratory failure. Option E is incorrect because even though the patient had increased blood counts, this was connected to her myeloproliferative disorder and not her respiratory state. The management through bone marrow biopsy relates to her myelodysplastic syndrome and not her hypoxic respiratory failure."
47,1,12710627,What were the findings of the EKG undertaken on the patient and what were the immediate steps taken after this?,"The EKG showed that the patient had a normal heart rhythm, but was mildly tachycardic. Medicinal treatment was initiated immediately to control the heart rate.",The EKG showed evidence of ventricular tachycardia which was treated with anti-arrhythmic medications.,"The EKG showed signs of a previous heart attack, but no immediate steps were taken after this.","The EKG exhibited sinus tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy and ST depression in anterolateral leads. Afterward, the patient received albuterol and Lasix, and was put on IV nitroglycerin due to high blood pressure.",The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no further action needed.,D,"The recorded EKG results from the discharge summary show that the patient had sinus tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ST depression in the anterolateral leads. Consequently, the patient was treated with albuterol, Lasix, and IV nitroglycerin due to high blood pressure. Options A, B, C, and E incorrectly portray the EKG results and subsequent treatment measures taken."
48,1,13140413,What significant finding was discovered via an echo done on the patient during their stay?,The patient displayed early signs of ventricular systolic dysfunction.,The patient had an abnormally increased left atrial volume index.,The patient was found to have moderate aortic valve stenosis.,The patient had an atrial septal defect.,The patient showed signs of chronic microvascular ischemic changes.,C,"The echo done during the patient's stay found out that the patient had moderate aortic valve stenosis (as stated in 'The patient has moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis...' paragraph). This condition leads to a narrowing of the aortic valve, which can restrict blood flow. Options A, D, and E are incorrect because they were not reported in the patient's echo results. Option A is not right as the echo results showed that the patient had normal biventricular systolic function. Option D is incorrect as it is stated that no atrial septal defect can be seen on the patient. Option E is incorrect because the potential chronic microvascular ischemic changes were suggested by a head CT scan, not the patient's echo. Option B is partially correct as the echo report does mention a mildly increased left atrial volume index, but it is not a significant finding and is usually associated with ageing or mild heart disease."
49,1,12628860,What was the main progress seen in the patient's condition during her hospital stay and what medication and treatment plan was designed for her upon discharge?,"The patient's disorganized thinking improved slightly, and she was put on a treatment plan involving homeopathic remedies.","The patient show slight improvement in her organization and paranoia. She was started on Invega Sustenna, an injectable antipsychotic, Cogentin for EPS symptoms, Ativan for anxiety, along with a referral to a partial program and extended care facility.",The patient's condition did not improve and she refused any medication for her schizophrenia.,The patient showed significant improvement in her depression and was put on a treatment plan involving counseling and Ativan.,The patient made no progress in her treatment and was discharged with no instructions for future medication or treatment.,B,"The patient's condition improved during her hospital stay, primarily in the areas of paranoia, organization, and ability to care for herself. She had notably better relationships with her family and considerably improved boundaries with others. Her medication plan post-discharge includes Invega Sustenna, an antipsychotic; Cogentin for EPS symptoms; and Ativan for anxiety (option B). This is backed up by pertinent parts of the discharge summary, though the above wording is a paraphrase and not a quote. The other options are incorrect as they either significantly misinterpret the progress made, misstate the treatment plan designed for her after discharge or don't correspond with the information given in the discharge summary."
50,1,18650119,"What were the manifestations observed during the patient's stay at the hospital, indicating her psychological health, as per the charted note on 2144-07-01?",The patient had intensive care treatment due to severe heart problems.,"The patient showed signs of probable dementia, such as disorientation and memory problems.","The patient displayed symptoms indicating severe depression, stress after relationship breakup, self-induced harm, and denial of harmful impulses but recognised the need for therapy.",The patient was under psychiatric care due to eating disorders.,The patient presented severe symptoms of an allergic reaction to penicillins.,C,"Option C reflects the critical points in the case note. It mentions the patient's depression, stress due to a break-up, self-harming behaviour, and denial of suicidal tendencies, all of which are specified in the note. However, the note also indicates that the patient recognises the need for counselling or therapy. The other options, while containing details from the case note, do not correctly answer the doctor's question regarding the patient's psychological health manifestations observed during the hospital stay. Options A, B, D, and E either focus on conditions the patient does not have or provides irrelevant information such as the patient's allergy to penicillins."
51,1,14932641,What was the clinical stage of the patient's lung cancer at the time of his admission and were there any major surgical procedures performed for his condition?,"The patient was in stage cT3aN0M0, IIIB lung cancer and underwent a right pneumonectomy","The patient was diagnosed with stage cT2aN0M0, IB lung cancer and a left upper lobectomy was performed, among other procedures","The patient had stage cT1bN2M1b, IVB lung cancer and had a right lower lobectomy","The clinical stage of the lung cancer at the time of admission was cT2aN2M0, IIB and a segmentectomy was performed","The patient was in stage cT2bN0M0, IIA lung cancer and the patient had a left lower lobectomy",B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient was clinically staged as cT2aN0M0, IB lung cancer at the time of his admission (B). The patient underwent surgical procedures such as an exploratory thoracoscopy, left thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy, chest wall resection, mediastinal lymph node dissection, among others.  Options A, C, D, E are incorrect because they either provide the wrong stage of lung cancer or the wrong surgical procedures based on the discharge summary. Using facts from the discharge summary to create plausible-sounding distractors increases the complexity of the question, as the examinee must carefully read and understand the question and all the answer choices."
52,1,17284399,"What surgical procedures were performed on the patient during the hospital stay, and what was the state of his health post-procedure?",The patient underwent a liver transplant and was in recovery post-operation.,The patient had a gastric bypass surgery and showed signs of rehabilitation afterwards.,"The patient received two coronary artery bypass grafts, total arterial revascularization, skeletonization of internal mammary artery grafts, bilateral pulmonary vein isolation, maze procedure and left atrial appendage ligation. He was in stable condition post-operation and able to move on his own by the time of discharge.",The patient had a hip replacement surgery and was mobile post-operation.,The patient underwent a kidney transplant and was on a course of immunosuppressants post-operation.,C,"In the discharge summary, it is stated clearly that the patient underwent two coronary artery bypass grafts and multiple other procedures related to the heart. After the operations, he was in stable condition and was able to move freely by the time of his discharge. The other options, A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they mention procedures that were not performed on the patient. These procedures are not mentioned anywhere in the discharge summary. Hence, the correct answer is C."
53,1,10707247,"What was the patient's highest levels of ALT and AST following the acetaminophen overdose, and what were the levels at the time of discharge?","The highest ALT was around 400 and AST was 500; at discharge, ALT was 60 and AST was 500.","The highest ALT was about 9000 and AST was 8000; at discharge, ALT was 631 and AST was 60.","The highest ALT was about 631 and AST was 465; at discharge, ALT was 200 and AST was 400.","The highest ALT was about 8000 and AST was 9000; at discharge, ALT was 60 and AST was 631.","The highest ALT was around 465 and AST was 390; at discharge, ALT was 200 and AST was 400.",B,"In the discharge summary, it is clear that the ALT and AST levels post-overdose were the highest at about 9000 and 8000 respectively. At the time of discharge, the levels had dropped significantly, with the ALT now at 631 and the AST at 60. The other options may seem plausible as they incorporate actual measurements cited in the summary, but none of them accurately coincide with the maximum levels observed after the overdose and the levels measured at discharge."
54,1,15453768,What interventions were performed for the patient's complete heart block?,The patient was administered diuretics for her complete heart block.,The patient was initiated on Chemotherapy due to her complete heart block.,The patient underwent a surgical procedure to correct her complete heart block.,The patient was paced transcutaneously for her complete heart block.,The patient received stem cell therapy to treat her complete heart block.,D,"According to the information provided in the summary, the patient was paced transcutaneously for her complete heart block. Answers A, B, C and E are incorrect as they consist of various interventions and treatments mentioned in the report but not specifically utilized for the patient's complete heart block. Answer A may be misconstrued as correct as diuretics were used, but this was actually used in treating pulmonary edema, not the heart block specifically; B is incorrect because chemotherapy was not used in the patient's treatment and is typically associated with cancer and not heart blocks; C is also incorrect as no surgical procedure for heart block is mentioned in the report; E is wrong because the patient did not receive any kind of stem cell therapy for her condition. So, option D is the correct answer as per the information provided in the report."
55,1,16827464,What were the patient's stroke-associated admission neurological examination findings and their findings upon discharge from the inpatient stay?,"The patient had a score of 25 on the NIH Stroke Scale upon admission with a significant right hemiplegia and severe global aphasia. Upon discharge, she showed very little improvement.","The patient had a significant left hemiplegia and moderate dysarthria upon admission, which improved to minor hemiplegia and no dysarthria upon discharge.","The patient presented severe aphasia and right hemiplegia upon admission, and showed marked improvement to minor aphasia and slight right-side weakness upon discharge.","Upon admission, the patient's NIH Stroke Scale score was 25 with significant left-sided weakness. Upon discharge, the patient was fully mobile with only occasional speech difficulties.",The patient was presented with severe global aphasia and right-sided weakness upon admission. There was no significant improvement at the time of discharge.,A,"Option A is correct as it aligns with the information provided in the discharge summary, which indicates that the patient had a score of 25 on the NIH Stroke Scale upon admission, and despite undergoing thrombectomy, showed very little improvement upon discharge.   Option B is incorrect as it states the patient had a left hemiplegia upon admission and that she showed improvement upon discharge. However, the discharge summary clearly mentions the presence of a right hemiplegia and no significant improvement upon discharge.  Option C is incorrect as it suggests that the patient showed marked improvement upon discharge, which contradicts the discharge summary stating that the patient showed very little improvement.  Option D is incorrect as it states that the patient had left-sided weakness upon admission and improved upon discharge, while the discharge summary indicates right-sided weakness upon admission and little improvement upon discharge.  Option E is incorrect because it mentions significant improvement upon discharge, whereas the discharge summary suggests that there was very little change in the patient's condition."
56,1,19058635,Why was it considered that the patient had a low score on her NIHSS and what was the management strategy based on this assessment?,The patient had a low NIHSS score as her blood pressure was 220/110. The management plan included a wide spectrum of antibiotics to control her blood pressure.,The patient was judged to have a low NIHSS score because her glucose level was 121. The management focus was treating her diabetes.,The patient's NIHSS score was regarded as low due to her improved right facial droop during transit. Her management strategy was based on auto-regulation of her blood pressure and the initiation of ASA 325mg.,"The patient had a score of 2 on the NIHSS scale, indicating a potential stroke. The management assigned was to start her on t-PA immediately.",The NIHSS score was considered low because she showed full strength on her right side. The management plan was to continue her home dose of statin and atenolol.,C,"The patient's NIHSS score was low, as mentioned in the discharge summary, due to an improving right facial droop condition during transit; therefore, t-PA was not indicated. The management plan incorporated the auto-regulation of her blood pressure and initiation of ASA 325mg. All other options are incorrect. Options A, B, D, and E are not based on mild symptoms or observations discussed in the provided notes. Option D mentions the use of t-PA, which was explicitly ruled out in the doctor's note, making it incorrect."
57,1,12063464,"What was the critical finding of the cardiac catheterization, that led the patient to require coronary artery bypass graft surgery?",Patient reported discomfort within a minute of starting to walk.,Patient was found to have mild aortic regurgitation.,Patient was found to have left main disease.,Patient was found to have mild mitral regurgitation.,Patient was found to have patchy left basilar opacity.,C,"The correct answer is C. The discharge summary notes that upon catheterization, the patient was found to have left main disease and this was the reason why he was referred for surgery. Options A, B, D and E are incorrect. Although referring to details mentioned in the medical history, they do not pertain to the cardiac catheterization. The discomfort was the initial complaint rather than a critical finding and whilst aortic and mitral regurgitation were mentioned, they were classified as mild and therefore would not typically require a surgical intervention. Lastly, the patient was found to have a patchy left basilar opacity, but this is a pulmonary finding and not related to the heart."
58,1,13257820,What is the suspected cause of the patient's cardiomyopathy and how was it treated?,"The cardiomyopathy was caused by coronary artery disease, and the patient was treated with vancomycin, gentamycin, and fentanyl.","The cardiomyopathy was suspected to be due to an insect bite, and the patient was treated with doxycycline, lisinopril, and beta-blocker.","The cardiomyopathy originated from a viral illness, and the patient was treated with Zyrtek, Levaquin, and Prednisone.","The cause of the cardiomyopathy was unknown, but the patient was treated with captopril to prevent remodeling.","The cardiomyopathy was caused by epididymitis, and the patient was treated with Levaquin.",B,"The summary clearly indicates that the cardiomyopathy is most likely due to an infectious mycarditis following an insect bite as mentioned in the discharge diagnosis, various points in the hospital course, and discharge instruction. The patient was treated with doxycycline as an empiric treatment for the suspected lyme and ehrlichia infection, Lisinopril (after switching from captopril) associated with the disease and a beta-blocker for controlling the rhythm of the heart beats. While the other options all contain information from the report, they aren't the suspected cause of the patient's cardiomyopathy or the correct treatment. For example, coronary artery disease was ruled out through Cardiac Catheterization (Option A), this eliminates any treatment with vancomycin, gentamycin, and fentanyl for it. The patient did have a viral illness (Option C), but was not mainly treated with Zyrtek, Levaquin, and Prednisone - Zyrtek is for allergies, Levaquin was taken before the hospital admission but was not associated with the main treatment, and Prednisone was used for treating the rash from the insect bite but it's not mentioned as a part of the main treatment neither. Captopril was initially used but was switched to Lisinopril, thus it wasn't the primary part of the treatment as suggested in Option D. The patient's previous history includes epididymitis (Option E), but it is not related as the cause of his cardiomyopathy, nor Levaquin is the appropriate treatment for it in this case."
59,1,13664021,"What changes were made to the patient's medication regimen following their hospital stay for an acute ischemic stroke, which was suspected to be cardioembolic in origin due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and subtherapeutic INR on admission?",The patient was prescribed aspirin and discontinued Metoprolol Succinate XL.,The addition of Atorvastatin and a future alteration from aspirin to rivaroxaban.,"Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide were terminated, and rivaroxaban was initiated.","No changes were made, the same medications were retained.","Warfarin dosage was increased, and Metoprolol Succinate XL was discontinued.",B,"The discharge summary informs that the patient was instructed to initiate daily intake of aspirin and atorvastatin. Shortly following discharge, a substitution from aspirin to rivaroxaban was recommended. The other options (A, C, D, E) are incorrect as metoprolol was not discontinued (A, E), Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide were not terminated (C), no mention of increasing warfarin dosage was made (E), and some changes were indeed made to the medications (D). Thus, the correct answer is B as it comprehensively outlines the modifications in the medication regimen."
60,1,14638620,What were the primary causes of the patient’s shortness of breath upon admission and how were these managed during the hospital stay?,"The patient's shortness of breath was primarily caused by an acute kidney disease, which was managed by avoiding nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose medications.","The patient's shortness of breath was primarily due to a chronic lung disease, which was managed with inhalers and oxygen therapy.","The shortness of breath was caused by a flare-up of the patient's hypothyroidism, which was managed by increasing levothyroxine doses.","The patient's shortness of breath was principally due to an acute exacerbation of her congestive heart failure and this was managed by aggressive diuresis, taking care of her thyroid dysfunction, and modifying her medication regimen.","The patient's shortness of breath was primarily due to a cardiac rhythm problem, which was managed by maintaining her in a normal sinus rhythm throughout her stay.",D,"The discharge summary outlines that the patient's shortness of breath was principally a result of an acute exacerbation of her congestive heart failure. This is supported by the fact that she was admitted with symptoms of fluid overload - CXR suggestive of 'florid pulmonary edema'. It was managed with a combination of active diuresis (Lasix), improving her hormone profile (high TSH and low FT4 causing 'worsened diastolic dysfunction'), and appropriate modifications to her medications (metoprolol, lisinopril, and stopping Lasix).   Options A, B, C and E provide information from the discharge summary but these details were not the primary causes of the patient's shortness of breath. They represent either unrelated conditions that the patient has (like acute on chronic kidney disease or hypothyroidism) or conditions that were not acute problems causing shortness of breath during this hospital stay (like chronic pulmonary disease or rhythm issues)."
61,1,12606357,What was the identified organism causing the patient's urinary tract infection and what medication was administered to treat this infection?,The infection was due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and the patient was treated with amoxicillin.,The infection was caused by Escherichia coli and they received a treatment of ceftriaxone.,The patient was affected by Staphylococcus aureus and was given vancomycin.,The urinary tract infection was due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and it was treated with ciprofloxacin.,The organism causing the infection was Klebsiella pneumoniae and the medication prescribed was cephalexin.,B,"The discharge summary identifies that the patient's urinary tract infection was caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. Coli), and the patient was treated with ceftriaxone.   Option A does not align with the information in the discharge summary as Streptococcus pneumoniae and amoxicillin are not mentioned. In Option C, Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin are not cited in the discharge summary. Similarly, option D is wrong since Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin are not mentioned in the summary. And finally, option E is incorrect as it speaks of Klebsiella pneumoniae and cephalexin, which are not found in the patient's notes. Hence, this makes option B the correct choice."
62,1,14141892,What was the patient's primary and secondary diagnosis during their discharge summary?,The primary diagnosis was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) while the secondary diagnosis was Hypertension.,The primary diagnosis was acute respiratory failure and the secondary diagnosis was pneumonia.,The primary diagnosis was coronary artery disease and the secondary diagnosis was diabetes mellitus on insulin.,The primary diagnosis was acute on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and the secondary diagnosis was acute diastolic heart dysfunction.,The primary diagnosis was peripheral vascular disease and the secondary diagnosis was hypertension.,D,"In the discharge summary, it has been clearly stated that the primary diagnosis of the patient was acute on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Additionally, the secondary diagnosis was acute diastolic heart dysfunction. The other options were part of the patient's medical history, present illness, or were conditions related to her illness, but were not the primary or secondary diagnosis according to the discharge summary."
63,1,19091860,"Why did the patient's creatinine level rise significantly upon admission, and how was it addressed during his hospital stay?","The patient's creatinine level rose due to dehydration, aggravated by his extensive anti-hypertensive regimen and recent changes in his psychiatric medications. This was addressed by discontinuing his nifedipine, lisinopril, and labetalol, administering normal saline fluid resuscitation, and lowering the dose of labetalol.","The patient's creatinine rise was due to an allergic response to penicillins, treated by prescribing an alternative antibiotic.","The elevated creatinine was due to a rare side effect of Parnate, treated by discontinuing the drug.","The rise in creatinine levels was a result of his addiction disorder, treated with a regimen of detoxification therapy and counseling.","The patient's creatinine level rose due to an adverse reaction to Adderall, and this was addressed by stopping the medication.",A,"The patient's creatinine level rise is explained upon admission as likely related to pre-renal azotemia due to a lack of proper oral hydration, extensive anti-hypertensive therapy, and recent changes in psychiatric medications, which lead to hypotension. This was addressed by providing normal saline fluid resuscitation, stopping nifedipine, lisinopril, and labetalol, and lowering the dose of labetalol when restarted at discharge. The other choices related to allergies, a rare side effect of Parnate, an addictive disorder, and an adverse reaction to Adderall were not mentioned in the discharge summary as reasons for the elevated creatinine level."
64,1,10196336,What caused the patient's admission-acquired acute renal failure?,The patient's acute renal failure was caused by alcohol intake.,Ingestion of PineSol led to the patient's acute renal failure.,Renal failure due to the patient's chronic Hepatitis C condition.,The patient's acute renal failure was due to an inadequate fluid intake and mild starvation ketoacidosis.,Heroin abuse resulted in the patient's acute renal failure.,D,"According to the discharge summary, the patient's acute renal failure occurred during his hospital stay due to poor fluid intake and mild starvation ketoacidosis. This condition improved when IV fluids were administered, therefore pointing to dehydration as a likely cause. Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the discharge summary linking the acute renal failure to alcohol intake. Choice B is incorrect as the toxic ingestion of PineSol did not lead to renal failure but was part of the reason for admission, it is stated that the observed laboratory abnormalities were not consistent with damage due to acute toxin ingestion. Choice C is incorrect as the patient's chronic Hepatitis C condition did not directly result in the acute renal failure. Choice E is incorrect because whilst the patient's substance abuse is mentioned, it's not identified as the cause of the renal failure."
65,1,14292830,What were the clinical observations and measures taken to manage the patient's Prepatellar Bursitis as per the discharge summary charted on 2180-09-03?,The patient was prescribed antibiotics alone to treat the infection causing the Bursitis.,The patient received a prosthetic to help with his symptoms.,The patient was given diet control measures to deal with Bursitis.,"The patient was administered a course of methylprednisolone, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, along with advisement of ice, compression, and elevation of the leg.",The patient was treated solely with a regular exercise regimen.,D,"According to the discharge note provided, the patient with prepatellar bursitis was treated using methylprednisolone, NSAIDs (naproxen), acetaminophen for pain management, and advised to practice ice, compression, and elevation of the affected leg. No antibiotics were used as there was a low concern for an infectious process, ruling out option A. Prosthetics were not mentioned anywhere in the treatment, eliminating choice B. Diet control is usually not the primary intervention for Bursitis, thus eliminating choice C. Although physical therapy was mentioned, it was not the only measure taken to manage the condition thus ruling out choice E. So, the most accurate answer is D."
66,1,17851567,What were the findings of the dermatological punch biopsy conducted on the patient?,Hepatitis C induced lichen planus,"Discrete, pink, scaly plaques on the trunk and extremities",Entire body maculopapular rash confluent into raised plaques which blanch,The biopsy results are pending,Passed ampullary gallstone,D,"The discharge summary explicitly mentions that the punch biopsy results were pending at the time of discharge. None of the other answer choices are accurate as they include findings from physical examination, impression from different tests and speculations but not the result of the biopsy. Option A is a part of the differential diagnosis but not confirmed, Option B and C are observations from the physical exam not biopsy results. Option E is related to a separate part of the patient's condition and not related to the dermatological punch biopsy."
67,1,12239469,What was the patient's medical regimen while being discharged from the hospital and what were the doses?,The patient was discharged on Lovenox bridge to Coumadin 2.5 mg everyday.,"The patient was sent home with medications including Omeprazole 20 mg daily, Alprazolam 0.5 mg twice daily, Ondansetron 4 mg every 8 hours as needed for nausea, Oxybutynin 5 mg three times daily as needed for bladder spasm, Enoxaparin Sodium 80 mg twice daily, and HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 2 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.","Discharge medications included Alprazolam 0.5 mg, Omeprazole 20 mg, Coumadin 2.5 mg, and Ondansetron 4 mg, all to be taken daily.",The patient was discharged on Omeprazole 20 mg daily and Dilaudid 2 mg as needed for pain.,"Discharge medications included Alprazolam 0.5 mg once in the morning, Enoxaparin Sodium 80 mg as needed for pain, and Ondansetron 4 mg before meals.",B,"The question is asking about the total medical regimen of the patient while being discharged from the hospital. According to the discharge summary, it consisted of Omeprazole 20 mg daily, Alprazolam 0.5 mg twice daily, Ondansetron 4 mg every 8 hours as needed for nausea, Oxybutynin 5 mg three times daily as needed for bladder spasm, Enoxaparin Sodium 80 mg twice daily, and HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 2 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain. Option B is the only one that mentions all of these medications and their respective doses, making it the correct answer. The other options are incorrect as they either leave out certain medications or give incorrect dosages. These options were chosen as good distractors because they all contain elements of the correct answer such as medication or dosage but are incomplete or altered. This requires the examinee to know or review the full details of the discharge prescriptions provided in the discharge summary."
68,1,15768503,What were the manifestations of the patient's current illness and what were the treatments given during his hospital stay?,The patient had the flu with muscle aches and a sore throat. Treatments included an antiviral and plenty of rest.,The patient experienced migraine headaches and was given excedrin and ice packs as a primary treatment.,"The patient displayed symptoms of meningitis including, headaches, photophobia, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and chills. He was given medication, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, toradol, zofran, and reglan.",The patient was hospitalised for symptoms related to a tick-borne disease and was given antibiotics as treatment.,"The patient was suffering from a bacterial infection, manifesting as high fever and was given antibiotics to combat the infection.",C,"In the provided summary, it is mentioned that the patient's symptoms included headache, photophobia, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and fevers and chills, which are generalized symptoms of meningitis. The administered treatment regimen as mentioned included vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, toradol, zofran, and reglan. The other options are incorrect but are mentioned in the summary as potential or past illnesses (migraines, tick-borne disease, bacterial infection) or similar symptoms (flu), making them apt distractors."
69,1,11799366,What was the patient's discharge diagnosis and what treatment plans were recommended?,"The patient was diagnosed with Pneumonia, and was recommended to continue with hormonal therapy, strict diet, and regular doses of Aromasin, Toprol XL, Lipitor, and Warfarin.","The patient was diagnosed with Breast Cancer with mets to pleura and was recommended to rest at home, continue chemotherapy, and take doses of Aromasin, Diovan, and Warfarin.","The patient was diagnosed with Non-ST elevation MI, Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, Systolic heart failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The treatment recommended were changes in medication, weight monitoring, a low sodium diet, and fluid restriction.","The patient was diagnosed with a stroke, rest is advised at home along with strict medication plan that involves ingestion of Artorvastatin, Warfarin, and Aromasin.","With diagnosis of Vertigo, strict 2 gm sodium restriction, daily consumption of Valsartan, Furosemide and Warfarin is recommended for the patient.",C,"The patient's discharge diagnosis as given in the summary involved Non-ST elevation MI, Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, Systolic heart failure, acute on chronic hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Events and prescriptions after diagnosis were also discussed, from the placement of a stent, discontinuation of Dofetilide, alteration of the Warfarin levels, and a few changes to the patient's medications. Option C encapsulates this information correctly while others like A and B include diagnoses and treatment options that are not consistent with the discharge summary. Option D and E hold non-related diagnosis hence making them incorrect."
70,1,18884362,What was the management plan and prognosis for the patient's left forearm deep space infection in the context of her substance misuse and does it warrant any changes in her current treatment plan?,"Explored and drained the deep space abscess in the left forearm, and the wound was cured with antibacterial drugs.",Provision of iron supplements to treat the iron deficiency anemia.,The patient was successfully treated with a round of IV Vancomycin and Unasyn only.,The wound was examined and found to have no deep purulence or air tracking.,Provided the patient with narcotic prescription medications to manage her pain.,A,"The patient's management plan involved surgical intervention to inspect and drain the deep space abscess in the left forearm, alongside antibiotic therapy which initially began with IV Vancomycin and Unasyn, but was eventually changed to IV naficillin and oral Augmentin (option A). The rest of the options are incorrect as B refers to the treatment of anemia and not the deep space infection, while C is incorrect because Vancomycin and Unasyn alone were not enough to treat the infection. Option D is incorrect as the surgical notes indicate there was the presence of purulent material in the tissue and fascia, and option E refers to the pain management plan rather than the infection treatment. Additionally, the patient was not sent home with a narcotic prescription due to her substance misuse. Hence, the patient's drug misuse did warrant changes in her treatment plan, primarily the alteration in her pain management strategy."
71,1,13475776,"What were the initial and final cardiac medications prescribed to the patient, and why was a change made?",The patient was initially prescribed 325mg ASA and was then changed to 81mg ASA because all her cardiac tests returned negative results.,"Metformin 1000mg was the initial cardiac medication, but then it was changed to gabapentin 600mg TID because her stress test results were positive.",The initial cardiac medication was metaxalone 800mg BID and it was changed to aspirin 81mg based on neurologist's recommendation.,The patient was first given 325mg ASA and then was switched to Lipitor 20 mg daily since the patient showed symptoms of Lyme disease.,"The patient was started on metaxalone 800mg BID, but it was later switched to Lantus 100 unit/mL Solution to maintain her blood pressure levels.",A,"The discharge summary specifies that the patient was initially put on a 325mg ASA, but it was later switched to 81mg ASA as her cardiac enzymes and perfusion stress test results were negative. Selections B, E and C, although mentioning medications the patient is taking, these are not the cardiac drugs the patient was initially and subsequently prescribed. Option D is incorrect because Lipitor was added to her medication regime along with lisinopril and not swapped for another cardiac drug."
72,1,11726601,What measures were taken to control the patient's symptoms related to an unspecified psychotic disorder and depression during her hospital stay as per the note charted on 2139-11-03?,Patient was offered counseling and behavioral therapy interventions.,Patient was administered Zoloft to address depressive symptoms and Risperidone was substituted with Geodon for managing the psychotic disorder.,The patient was prescribed aspirin for her symptoms.,The patient was given medications for the treatment of her alcohol and cocaine use disorders.,Patient was provided with ECT treatment for symptom control.,B,"The discharge summary noted that in order to manage the patient's unspecified psychotic disorder and depressive symptoms, the initial medication of Zoloft was stopped because of its limited benefits. Instead, she was put on two other drugs, namely Risperidone and eventually Geodon. Option A is incorrect because while the patient was encouraged to attend group therapy, she declined to do so. Option C is false because there is no mention of aspirin being used to treat her symptoms, but rather it is listed as one of her allergies. Option D is false because, while substance abuse was discussed, no specific medications were utilized for its treatment during this hospitalization. Finally, option E is misleading as there is no mention of ECT therapy being used during her hospitalization."
73,1,15972589,"What was the likely cause of the patient's bilateral lower extremity edema, considering her history of Graves' disease post thyroid replacement therapy, normal cardiac work-up and echo results, and fatty liver disease?","The patient's bilateral lower extremity edema was due to her history of CAD s/p MI and LAD/RCA stents, paroxysmal SVT s/p ablation.",The patient's bilateral lower extremity edema was likely due to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism from high doses of levothyroxine.,The edema might have arisen from the patient's high dose of replacement thyroid hormone.,The patient's lower extremity edema could be attributed to her peptic ulcer disease.,The patient's edema was due to obesity and fatty liver.,B,"The patient's bilateral lower extremity edema is most likely due to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism resulting from high doses of levothyroxine(Correct Answer B) as mentioned in the Brief Hospital Course Section of the discharge summary. Higher dose of Levothyroxine used for replacement therapy can cause Hyperthyroidism and subsequently edema.  Option A is incorrect because normal cardiac work-up and echo results negate the chance of CAD s/p MI and LAD/RCA stents, paroxysmal SVT s/p ablation having caused the edema.  Option C is incorrect, Though replacement thyroid hormone was mentioned, it was not connected to the cause of edema in the discharge summary.  Option D is incorrect because the patient's peptic ulcer disease is not directly connected to lower extremity edema  Option E are incorrect because Fatty liver could cause edema but the patient's LFTs were within normal range and there was no ascites on ultrasound as per the Hospital Course. Obesity alone is less likely to cause bilateral lower extremity edema or specific medical conditions related to obesity which are not found in the summary. Hence, these are distractors."
74,1,19071886,What was the patient's condition and treatment plan regarding her anxiety and depression during her hospital stay?,The patient was constantly anxious but refused any treatment for her anxiety and depression.,"The patient didn't show any symptoms associated with her anxiety and depression, thus no treatment was administered.",The patient acknowledged her anxiety and depression but chose to combat these conditions without any medication.,"The patient wasn't suicidal during her admission, managed the causes of her previous attempt well, showed signs of future planning, didn't have a suicide plan, was followed by psychiatry, and continued her home medications for anxiety and depression.","The patient's anxiety and depression dramatically increased during her stay, causing her to take increased dosages of her home medications.",D,"In the provided discharge summary, it's stated that the patient denied suicidal ideation during her admission and managed well the causes that led to her previous suicide attempt. She is showing signs of future planning and did not have a suicide plan. Also, Psych followed her in the house and there were no high risk features. She continued her home medications (temazepam, clonazepam, gabapentin) for anxiety and depression. Therefore, D is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because it contradicts the patient's depression and anxiety treatment plan, as mentioned in the summary. Option B is wrong because even though the patient was not actively suicidal during her hospital stay, she was still dealing with anxiety and depression. Option C is incorrect because the patient continued her home medications. Option E is not true because there is no mention of the patient needing increased dosages of her medications."
75,1,13198577,"What is the patient's primary diagnosis and treatment plan upon discharge, according to the discharge summary from 2182-06-22?",The primary diagnosis is Recurrent DVT and the treatment plan includes a continunation of their home phenytoin.,The patient has a primary diagnosis of APS and they will be treated by continuing to take their atorvastatin.,The patient's primary diagnosis is chronic DVT and hyperlipidemia with a treatment plan that includes the continuation of both Enoxaparin Sodium and Warfarin and advising the patient about not doing heavy lifting for a week.,"The primary diagnosis is HTN and epilepsy, and the treatment plan includes a continuation of losartan.",The patient has been primarily diagnosed with HTN and the treatment plan includes continuing to use Niacin SR.,C,"According to the discharge summary, the patient's primary diagnosis is Chronic DVT as indicated in the discharge diagnosis and highlighted in different parts of the discharge summary. The treatment plan includes the continuation of Enoxaparin Sodium and Warfarin (examples of anticoagulant medications), until INR levels become therapeutic, as detailed in both the 'brief hospital course' and 'discharge medications' sections. Additionally, he has been advised not to do heavy lifting for a week as part of the post-procedural care instructions.   The distractors (A, B, D, and E) are incorrect for the following reasons:  Option A focuses on epilepsy, which is not the primary diagnosis, although the patient has a history of it.  Option B's diagnosis, APS, while related to the patient's condition, is not the primary diagnosis. Atorvastatin is also for hyperlipidemia, not APS.  Option E incorrectly states HTN as the primary diagnosis whereas, really, it's a part of a patient’s past medical history.  Option D also incorrectly lists HTN and epilepsy as the primary diagnosis whereas the patient is discharged on warfarin and enoxaparin having a primary diagnosis of Chronic DVT."
76,1,12419942,What was the primary diagnosis for the patient's admission under ID 22011645 dated 2166-08-09 and what were the significant procedures or treatments done during this hospital stay?,Primary diagnosis was hypertension and treatment included continuing intake of home medications.,Primary diagnosis was dementia and treatment involved discontinuing Aricept and Namenda.,Primary diagnosis was chronic renal failure and treatment was to avoid nephrotoxins.,Primary diagnosis was Aspiration pneumonitis and treatment included weaning off from non-rebreather oxygen to room air.,Primary diagnosis was Hypercholestermia and treatment consisted of continuing on the dose of Crestor.,D,"The primary diagnosis for this hospitalization, as stated in the discharge summary, was Aspiration pneumonitis. According to the same summary, the patient was quickly weaned off from the non-rebreather oxygen mask to room air, suggesting this was a significant part of her treatment. Though all the other diagnoses are mentioned in the discharge summary, none were cited as the primary cause for this particular admission. Similarly, while various treatments and prescription adjustments were also conducted during this hospital stay, they aren't directly linked to the primary diagnosis like choice D."
77,1,14393979,"What was the patient diagnosed with, and what was the most likely cause of the infection?",The patient was diagnosed with acute kidney infection caused by consumption of a high-fat diet.,"The patient was diagnosed with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and osteomyelitis, possibly caused by micro-tearing in the anorectal area during anal sex.",The patient was diagnosed with severe left flank pain and syncope due to a traumatic injury during a fall.,The patient was diagnosed with a dry cough due to inhaling bacteria from an infected person.,The patient was diagnosed with hypertension caused by consumption of too much salt in their diet.,B,"Patient's clinical findings indicate that he was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and osteomyelitis. Analyzing the patient's medical history and clinical signs, the possible cause of the infection could be micro-tearing in the anorectal canal during anal sex, which allowed the MRSA bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect as there was no explicit mention in the document about the patient having a kidney infection, severe flank pain due to a fall, a dry cough, or hypertension caused by a high-salt diet. Although the patient's history mentions hypertension, it does not suggest it as the cause of the infection."
78,1,17436366,What were the results of the patient's blood and urine cultures and what action was taken based on these results?,"The blood and urine cultures tested positive for enterococcus, moragnella, and coag neg staph, leading to the continuation of the patient's Meropenem medication.","The blood and urine cultures were unidentified, which initiated an investigation for a potential unknown pathogen.","The cultures showcased no signs of infection, indicating no need for additional medication.","The blood and urine cultures displayed signs of fibrous dysplasia, leading to an immediate operation.",The blood and urine cultures showed signs of rheumatoid arthritis and the patient was put on long term steroids.,A,"The discharge summary detailed a positive result for enterococcus, moragnella___, coag neg staph for the patient's blood and urine cultures. As a result, the physicians continued administering antibiotics, in this case, Meropenem. Option B is incorrect as the cultures are not unidentified, they tested positive for specific bacteria. Option C is false as the cultures were not infection-free, and the clinical team continued with the patient's antibiotics. Option D is incorrect as none of the identifiable bacteria are related to fibrous dysplasia. Option E is incorrect as the cultures provided information about infection, not signs of rheumatoid arthritis, and the patient wasn't put on steroids specifically for her arthritis."
79,1,15401422,"What specific type of mental status changes did the patient exhibit throughout their hospital stay, and how did it progress till discharge?","The patient had confusion and multiple falls, his condition did not improve till discharge.","The patient had multiple falls and seizures, by the time of discharge the seizures had declined.","The patient displayed disorientation and confusion, and by discharge, he could only identify person and year but not place.","The patient began with confusion and somnolence, which had resolved completely by discharge.","The patient was initially alert and showed gradual somnolence, with fully alert just before the discharge.",C,"The discharge notes mention that the patient was initially disoriented and confused. During the hospitalization, his mental status improved somewhat and upon discharge, the patient was oriented to person and year but still could not understand the place. Conversely, options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they do not match the progress of the patient's mental status as described in the discharge notes."
80,1,12582240,What medication changes were made during the patient's hospital stay and for what reasons?,Simvastatin dosage was reduced due to the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding.,Lisinopril and Metoprolol were discontinued because of low blood pressure of the patient.,Aspirin was discontinued due to patient's cardiac enzymes getting lower.,Lasix dosage was doubled to help patient recovering from blood loss.,The Alprazolam dosage was lowered to combat radiation proctitis side effects.,B,"The discharge summary directly reports that Lisinopril and Metoprolol medications were discontinued because of the patient's low blood pressure.   Although answer A is incorrect because Simvastatin dosage was increased from 20mg to 80mg, not reduced, it's a good distractor due to the change in Simvastatin dosage being discussed in the discharge summary. Answer C is incorrect but plausible as aspirin was indeed discontinued, but it was due to the patient's bleeding, not cardiac enzymes. Answer D is incorrect because while Lasix is mentioned in the discharge summary, the dosage wasn't doubled. The similarity in drug name might cause confusion.  Answer E is incorrect as radiation proctitis is mentioned, but it had nothing to do with changes in Alprazolam dosage. However, it is a good distractor as radiation proctitis was one of the patient’s conditions."
81,1,19213044,What was the main presenting complaint of the patient at the time of admission and what were the primary diagnostic measures taken during the hospitalization?,The patient was admitted for reasons related to her osteoporosis and was mainly treated with Calcium Acetate and Vitamin D.,"The patient was admitted for abdominal pain and underwent a variety of tests including guaiac positive stool testing, blood tests, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and a urinalysis.","The patient was admitted due to self-reported thoughts of self-harm, and her primary diagnostic measure was psychiatric consultation.",The patient was admitted primarily because of dementia symptoms and was treated mainly with Lisinopril.,The patient's primary complaint was a broken electric chair and was mainly subjected to physical exams related to back pain.,B,"The correct answer is B. The patient's main complaint was abdominal pain and, as the discharge summary shows, a variety of tests, including labs, a CT scan, and urinalysis were conducted to determine the cause of the pain. Answer choice A is invalid because the osteoporosis was a known pre-existing condition and not the main presenting complaint. Option C is fallacious because even though the patient did express thoughts of self-harm, it was secondary to her main complaint of abdominal pain. Choice D is incorrect as the patient's dementia was a known pre-existing condition, and Lisinopril is mainly used for hypertension, not dementia treatment. Lastly, answer E is incorrect as the broken electric chair was not the medical complaint that led to the admission, it was more of a secondary anecdotal detail mentioned by the patient."
82,1,11061972,"What significant medical history does the patient have, and what was the nature of her last presentation to the hospital prior to her passing?","The patient had a track record of diabetes mellitus type 2, and her last presentation to the hospital was related to severe diabetic ketoacidosis.","The patient's significant medical history includes hypertension, migraines, and irritable bowel syndrome, and her last presentation to the hospital was due to multi organ failure caused by uncontrolled hypertension.","The patient had a medical history of hypertension, migraines, and irritable bowel syndrome, and her last presentation involved a witnessed syncopal event, multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation arrest, hypoxic respiratory failure, and shock.","The patient suffered from chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure, and her final hospital presentation was due to acute kidney injury.",The patient had a major health history of HIV/AIDS and her last hospital visit was due to the severe progression of the disease.,C,"The patient's relevant historical medical information included hypertension, migraines, and irritable bowel syndrome as indicated in the discharge note. Additionally, her last presentation to the hospital showcased serious conditions like a witnessed syncopal event, numerous episodes of ventricular fibrillation arrest, respiratory failure due to hypoxia, and shock. All the other options are incorrect as they mention disorders or conditions that the patient did not have according to the discharge summary. Therefore, only option C correctly synthesizes the information provided."
83,1,13162544,What was the final diagnosis of the patient upon discharge and what were the medications prescribed on discharge?,"Diagnosis: Degenerative disc and joint disease, Medications: aspirin 81mg, HCTZ 25mg, and Simvastatin 80mg."," Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute to subacute infarcts, Medications: Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg, HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid), LeVETiracetam 500 mg, Simvastatin 80 mg, Faomotidine 20 mg, Docusate Sodium 100mg, Dexamethasone 2 mg.","Diagnosis: HLD, HTN, and DJD, Medications: gabapentin 60mg, ibuprofen 600mg, and vit B12.","Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, Medications: aspirin 81mg, HCTZ 25mg, and Simvastatin 80mg.","Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, Medications: Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg, HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid), LeVETiracetam 500 mg, Simvastatin 80 mg, Faomotidine 20 mg, Docusate Sodium 100mg, Dexamethasone 2 mg.",B,"Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute to subacute infarcts Medications: Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg, HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid), LeVETiracetam 500 mg, Simvastatin 80 mg, Famotidine 20 mg, Docusate Sodium 100mg, Dexamethasone 2 mg.  Reason:  The discharge diagnosis and prescribed medications upon discharge are presented directly in the discharge summary. All other options A, C, D, and E are incorrect. Option A refers to another diagnosis mentioned in the report but not as a final diagnosis. Option D and C refer to the medications the patient had been taking on admission, not those prescribed upon discharge. E is incorrect because it doesn't include all substances prescribed to the patient upon discharge."
84,1,18158679,What is the patient's allergy status as described in the discharge summary of 2199-12-07?,The patient is allergic to prednisone and Ativan.,The patient has no documented allergies.,The patient is allergic to Metoprolol and Strattera.,The patient is allergic to Penicillins and Ceclor.,The patient is allergic to Fluoxetine and Abilify.,D,"In the discharge summary, it is noted under the 'Allergies' section that the patient is allergic to ""Penicillins / Ceclor"". Therefore, option D is the correct answer. Options A, B, C and E are incorrect as they mention medicines not listed as allergens for the patient in the discharge summary. However, they make for good distractors as these medications are noted elsewhere in the summary (for instance, prednisone and Ativan were administered to the patient, and Metoprolol, Strattera, Fluoxetine, and Abilify are included in either the patients' 'Medications on Admission' or 'Discharge Medications' lists). Option B is also a good distractor as it completely contrasts the correct answer."
85,1,10932927,"What was the likely cause of the patient's rash, as per the skin biopsy results and dermatology consult, and what was the treatment approach decided upon discharge?",The probable cause was a reaction to a recent course of Ciprofloxacin. Treatment included additional intake of the same drug upon discharge.,The suspected cause is an unknown malignancy. Proposed treatment was continued observation and analysis.,"The plausible cause was a hypersensitivity vasculitis, likely from recent Bactrim use. The treatment strategy consisted of applying triamcinolone ointment to affected areas daily, wrapping them in seran wrap for one hour as well as ingesting colchicine.",The exploratory cause might be a bacterial infection. The patient was to be treated with antibiotics upon discharge.,"The assessment is that the cause is unknown, therefore, an in depth examination was to be done after discharge.",C,"Answer C is correct as it reflects the content of the notes. The presence of rash was shown to be a vasculitic reaction and Bactrim use was identified as a possible factor. The treatment suggested was application of Triamcinolone ointment and the use of colchicine. The distractors, although based on portions of the notes, do not answer the question correctly. Answer A inaccurately identifies Ciprofloxacin as the cause while the notes point to Bactrim. B implies an unidentified malignancy which is not confirmed in the notes. Answer D suggests a bacterial infection being the cause, but the Record shows no clear evidence to support this. Answer E, although partially accurate in that half of the cases have unknown cause, misrepresents the treatment suggestions upon discharge."
86,1,16214801,"What medication was the patient initially refusing to accept at a recommended dose, and what was her alternative preference prior to forced medication through court commitment?","The patient was refusing to accept the recommended dosages of antihypertensive medicines and preferred to take Levothyroxine 125mcg, which she previously took for her thyroid problems.",She was refusing to accept the recommended dosages of antipsychotic medicines and was only willing to take Navane 5mg daily.,The patient was declining the suggested quantities of cholesterol-reducing medicines and had a preference to take daily doses of Ativan for her anxiety.,She was refusing to accept the recommended quantities of Synthroid for her hypothyroidism and was only willing to take Fexofenadine for her allergies.,The patient was declining the suggested dosages of medicines for her lung cancer and preferred to stick to Pravastatin 10mg for her lipids levels.,B,"In the discharge summary note, the patient is documented as refusing to accept the recommended dosages of antipsychotic medications. Her preference was to take Navane 5mg daily, a medication she was previously prescribed and which had minimal side effects for her. This medication was forced by court commitment. The other options, while they are medications documented in the patient's medical history, they are not related to the patient’s refusal of taking medicine at a recommended dose. Moreover, none of these other medicines became her preference or were forced via court commitment."
87,1,11053485,"What medical interventions and medications were recommended for the patient's long-term management after his current stroke event, based on his discharge summary from November 18th, 2187?",Regular physical exercise and continuation of daily intake of esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg.,"Increase lovastatin dosage to 80 mg daily, daily intake of 81 mg aspirin and outpatient sleep study.",LSD treatment in addition to atenolol 50 mg daily and triamterene-HCTZ (37.5/25) 1 CAP PO daily.,Antibiotic treatment with metformin 500 mg twice a day along with adjustment of cholesterol levels.,Daily full course of vitamins and minerals supplementation with maintenance of blood pressure treatments.,B,"Based on the summary, the patient's cholesterol level was observed to be high (LDL of 105). As a measure for stroke prevention, it was recommended that the dosage of the statin drug Lovastatin be increased from 40 mg to 80 mg daily. There was also a prescription for the daily intake of aspirin 81 mg to help reduce the risk of a future stroke. The doctors also recommended that the patient undergoes an outpatient sleep study, likely due to suspicions of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) which could potentially increase the risk of future stroke events. The other options, while containing elements from the discharge summary, do not propose the correct long-term medical interventions as directed by the doctor."
88,1,11370713,What was the main cause of the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis on admission date (2111-03-11) and what was the approach taken to treat it?,The main cause of the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis was his intake of illicit substances and it was treated through detoxification.,"The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis was mainly caused by his alcohol abuse, which was treated with sudden alcohol abstinence.","The main cause of the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis was most likely lactic acidosis due to hypovolemia, treated with intravenous fluids.",The primary reason for the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis was untreated diabetes mellitus type II and it was managed with insulin therapy.,The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis was primarily caused by his intake of excess tobacco and it was treated with a nicotine patch.,C,"From the information provided in the discharge summary, the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis was most likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of hypovolemia, as a result of a history of alcohol abuse. However, this cannot be caused directly by alcohol or tobacco use (options B and E), nor illicit substance intake, as the patient denies using them (option A). It also doesn't mention that diabetes might have been a direct cause (option D). The approach to manage the patient's metabolic acidosis was through the administration of intravenous fluids (IVF). Therefore, the correct answer is option C."
89,1,10870829,What was the most likely reason for the patient's severe anemia and what was done to investigate and manage it?,"The patient had a bacterial infection, causing the anemia which was managed with antibiotics.",The patient was anemic due to malnourishment and was given dietary supplements and nutritional advice.,"The patient's anemia was likely due to excessive aspirin use and associated gastrointestinal bleeding. Management included blood transfusion, investigations with diagnostic procedures such as an EGD and CT scan, changes in medication and recommendation for further tests.",The patient had anemia due to preexisting genetic conditions and was given supportive care.,The patient's anemia was caused by chronic disease resulting in the malfunctioning of the bone marrow which was managed with a bone marrow transplant.,C,"The note describes the patient suffering from anemia with a history of excessive aspirin use which can lead to bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This is confirmed by the patient's symptoms of dark tarry stools. The patient has been managed with blood transfusions, given a PPI and the cause of the bleeding was investigated with an EGD and CT scan. Further colonoscopy has been recommended. Other options are incorrect as they describe causes or management methods which haven't been mentioned in the description. Moreover, options A, B, E involve causes like bacterial infection, malnourishment, chronic disease and genetic conditions which are not suggested in the note. Option D suggests a course of treatment - bone marrow transplant - that was not part of the patient’s management."
90,1,14643554,"What was the cause of the patient's intracranial hemorrhage, and what medications were used to manage the aftermath?",The patient experienced a hemorrhage due to high blood pressure and was treated with Folic Acid and Hydrochlorothiazide.,"The hemorrhage occurred due to head trauma at work and the patient was treated with Mannitol, Keppra, and Nicardipine gtt.",The patient's hemorrhage occurred as a result of a stroke and she was administered with Heparin and LevETIRAcetam.,"The hemorrhage was caused by a pre-existing genetic disorder, and was treated using Metoprolol Tartrate and Acetaminophen.",The patient suffered a hemorrhage after an unsuccessful surgery and was managed with celecoxib and prednisolone.,B,The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage was caused by a box hitting her head at work as mentioned in the 'History of Present Illness' section of the summary. The patient was then given 100g Mannitol and 1000mg Keppra and Nicardipine gtt was initiated to maintain SBP<140 to manage the aftermath mentioned in the same section. Although other mentioned medications were used during her treatment in general but none of the other options correctly describe the cause and medications used specifically for the intracranial hemorrhage.
91,1,19152488,What were the active infections identified in the patient during his last visit and the respective treatments prescribed for these conditions?,The patient was identified with Lyme disease and Babesiosis with treatments prescribed including Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid and Azithromycin.,The patient was identified with Asplenia and Hemolytic Anemia with treatments prescribed including Losartan Potassium and Aspirin.,The patient was identified with Right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate and Hepatic rupture with treatments prescribed including Metoprolol Succinate XL and CTX.,"The patient had a Cerebellar aneurysm and battled with alcohol use, treatments prescribed included Doxycycline Hyclate, Atovaquone Suspension, and continual alcohol counseling.","The patient was identified with Lyme disease and Babesiosis, with treatments prescribed including Doxycycline Hyclate, Atovaquone Suspension, and Azithromycin.",E,"The correct answer is E. In the 'active issues' section it was mentioned that the patient had been diagnosed with both Lyme disease and Babesiosis. The treatment for these conditions included a course of Doxycycline Hyclate and atovaquone for Babesia and Azithromycin for Lyme disease. Choices A, B, C and D are incorrect because although the patient had Asplenia and alcohol use, these are not infectious diseases and do not fall under the purview of the initial question. The drugs mentioned in those options are also not primarily used for treating infections, hence are invalid. Similarly, Right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate and Hepatic rupture are not infections, hence option C is incorrect. While option E might appear correct, the drug amoxicillin-clavulanic Acid mentioned is prescribed as a backup (""pill-in-pocket"") for potential future fevers, rather than a direct treatment for the infections."
92,1,13372117,What were the main infection sources causing the patient's symptoms and what treatment has been administered?,The primary source of the patient's symptoms was an infection originating from the lungs with treatment administered being blood transfusion.,"The patient's symptoms were primarily due to infection sourced from the spleen, and the treatment employed was surgical removal of the spleen.","The infection causing the symptoms descended from the appendix and liver, and the treatment was invasion of the liver abscess, interval appendectomy and a course of Ceftriaxone.","The infection was due to a brain abscess causing the symptoms, with treatment involving radiation therapy.","The primary infection source was from the kidneys, with dialysis treatment being the administered course of action.",C,"The correct answer is Choice C since it's specified in the discharge summary that the patient has a Strep anginosis bloodstream infection likely caused by bacteria that moved from the appendix to the liver. The treatment included percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess, plan for interval appendectomy, and therapeutic Ceftriaxone. Other options are incorrect as they cited organs and treatments not highlighted in the patient's actual discharge notes, and thus serve as apt distractions."
93,1,15273463,"What were the identified conditions causing the patient's tarry stools, and what procedures were done to address them?","The patient's tarry stools were caused by the gastritis/duodenitis and blood loss anemia, addressed by increasing the dosage of labetalol and by the administration of hydrocodone-acetaminophen.","The patient's tarry stools were caused by gastritis secondary to drug allergies, addressed by discontinuing the allergic medication and receiving fluids on discharge.","The patient's tarry stools were caused by acute renal failure and hypertension, addressed by the administration of labetalol and hydrochlorothiazide.","The patient's tarry stools were due to duodenal ulcers and gastritis/duodenitis, addressed by the procedure of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with endoclipping of the ulcers.","The patient's tarry stools were caused by acute blood loss anemia, which was addressed by the administration of an anti-ulcer medication, pantoprazole.",D,"The notes indicate that the patient’s tarry stools were connected to duodenal ulcers and gastritis/duodenitis conditions (D). The procedure of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with endoclipping was chosen to treat this. Option A is wrong because the mention of dosages on labetalol and administration of hydrocodone-acetaminophen were not utilized to address the tarry stools condition. Options B and C incorrectly identify the conditions causing the tarry stools, and the provided treatments don’t align with those mentioned in the notes. Option E rightly identifies one of the conditions (acute blood loss anemia) causing the tarry stools but ignores the duodenal ulcers and gastritis/duodenitis, and pantoprazole was administered but was not the sole treatment measure for the condition."
94,1,10236280,What was the suspected cause of the patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis?,The patient's respiratory failure was primarily a result of liver cirrhosis.,The patient's respiratory difficulty stemmed mainly from chronic interstitial lung changes due to his obesity.,Respiratory acidosis and hypoxemic respiratory failure particularly took place due to the patient's significant lung issues compounded by potential sepsis from an intra-abdominal infection.,The patient's respiratory problems were fundamentally caused by obstruction due to gallstones found in a CT scan.,Renal failure was the root cause of the patient's respiratory issues.,C,"The discharge notes indicate that the patient had been hospitalized multiple times due to pulmonary fibrosis and COPD, suggesting that he had severe lung issues. Later, the notes suggest that sepsis from an intra-abdominal infection (possibly cholecystitis) could have triggered an exacerbation of the patient's lungs, leading to severe respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.   While answer A is incorrect, liver cirrhosis could contribute to general ill health but is not directly related to respiratory failure. Option B is misleading because the patient's obesity could exacerbate breathing difficulties, but there is no solid evidence to suggest that it was the primary cause here. Similarly, answer D is not correct. Gallstones were found in the patient's gallbladder during the hospital stay, but we can't link them directly to the cause of respiratory failure. Renal failure, as stated in option E, could contribute to the overall critical condition of the patient, but it wasn't the main cause of his respiratory issues."
95,1,18730748,What interventions were carried out during the patient's hospitalization in response to her episode of ventricular tachycardia?,The patient was given 500 mg of Cephalexin every 6 hours for 2 days,The patient's home nifedipine and atenolol were discontinued,An EP study was done and ablation of ventricular tachycardia followed by ICD placement,The patient underwent a diagnostic femoral vascular ultrasound,The patient was initiated on a lidocaine drip,C,"The main interventions as mentioned in the notes during the patient's hospitalization in response to her ventricular tachycardia were an EP study and ablation of the ventricular tachycardia, followed by ICD placement. Option A is incorrect because cephalexin is an antibiotic and would not be used to treat ventricular tachycardia - it was prescribed for another reason. Option B is incorrect because although these medications were discontinued, they weren't specifically an intervention for her ventricular tachycardia. Option D is incorrect because although a femoral vascular ultrasound was performed, it was conducted due to the patient's complication from the procedure and not a direct response to her ventricular tachycardia. Option E is also not correct because while the patient was started on the lidocaine drip, it is not the main intervention, the ablation and ICD placement were higher level and definitive interventions."
96,1,12526500,What was the patient's final diagnosis and discharge disposition based on her symptoms and test results in the chart dated 2186-01-17?,The patient was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis and discharged to a specialized cardiovascular hospital.,The patient resulted in having high blood pressure and was discharged to her own home with supervision and aid.,The patient was diagnosed with bradycardia along with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and her discharge was arranged with a home-based aid system.,The patient was concluded to suffer from hypotension and released to a post-acute rehabilitation facility.,The patient was diagnosed with diabetes and dispatched to a respite care facility for further management.,C,"The patient was diagnosed with bradycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation based on her symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath) and testing during the hospital stay, which eventually led to the pacemaker procedure. Post-procedure the patient was dispatched to her home with services in place.   Option A is incorrect as there is no mention of deep venous thrombosis in the discharge summary.  Option B is wrong because, despite the presence of high blood pressure, it was not the final diagnosis.  Option D is incorrect because, although the patient initially had hypotension, it was not listed as a final diagnosis in the discharge summary.  Option E is also wrong because even though the patient has a history of diabetes, the final diagnosis was based on her cardiac issues. Despite the existence of all these health conditions in the patient's record, option C is the only one that correctly merges both final diagnosis and disposition."
97,1,19375059,"What was the ultimate condition of the patient's AV fistula according to the July 20, 2149 discharge summary?",The patient's AV fistula was successfully repaired using angioplasty.,The fistula was unable to be repaired and remained non-functional.,The AV fistula was replaced with a graft.,The fistula was completely removed.,The status of the AV fistula remained inconclusive.,A,"The discharge summary indicates that a fistulagram with angioplasty was performed as a major surgical or invasive procedure. Based on the context, the ultimate condition of the patient's AV fistula was successfully repaired using angioplasty (Choice A).  Choice B is incorrect because the procedure was performed to repair it.  Choice C is not true as the notes make clear that angioplasty was performed, not a graft replacement.  Choice D is incorrect because the fistula was not removed.  Choice E is also not true because the report clearly specifies the findings from the angioplasty procedure, indicating that the status of the AV fistula is not inconclusive."
98,1,17402372,"What were the key findings from the patient's TTE and Telemetry results, and what was the conclusion regarding the etiology of the patient's stroke?","TTE demonstrated a patent foramen ovale, and telemetry captured several episodes of atrial fibrillation. The stroke was determined to be embolic in nature.","TTE showed a normal study with no PFO, and telemetry indicated no evidence of atrial fibrillation. The cause of the stroke is likely cardioembolic.","TTE identified a left ventricular thrombus, and telemetry revealed frequent ventricular ectopic beats. The stroke was deemed to be thromboembolic.","TTE was inconclusive due to poor image quality, and telemetry displayed frequent sinus pauses. The etiology of the stroke remains uncertain.","TTE found moderate aortic stenosis, and telemetry showed sinus tachycardia. The stroke was determined to be hemorrhagic.",B,"In the discharge summary, it is stated that TTE was a normal study with no patent foramen ovale (PFO) finding and telemetry found no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Also, the etiology for the infarct was likely cardioembolic, which justifies the selection of choice B as the correct one.   While options A, C, D, and E contain elements that are mentioned in the discharge summary, none of them accurately represent the findings regarding TTE, telemetry or stroke etiology. Therefore, they serve as effective distractors demonstrating misinterpretations of the descriptive data presented in this discharge summary."
99,1,15923248,"What was the patient's substance use history, especially in terms of the frequency and quantity of alcohol intake, and what were the key interventions undertaken during hospitalization to manage her substance abuse?",The patient has been battling alcohol addiction for several decades and regularly drinks two bottles of wine a day. The hospital implemented a treatment plan of detoxification with continuous worsening anxiety protocol and changed her medication regimen.,The patient has been abusing alcohol for several years and consumes a bottle of beer every evening. The hospital focused on psychological counseling and moral support to manage her substance abuse.,"The patient was reportedly consuming drugs, such as cocaine and marijuana daily. The hospital adopted a psychological counseling along with group therapy sessions to address her addiction.",The patient had a history of only occasional alcohol consumption and had ingested alcohol only once during her trip. The hospital focused on dietary interventions to manage her substance abuse.,The patient displayed an addiction to smoking and consumed around 10 cigarettes a day. The hospital developed a treatment plan which encompassed nicotine patches and counseling sessions.,A,"Based on the notes provided on the patient, she has been abusing alcohol for ""many many years"" and currently consumes a few bottles of wine nightly. Several key interventions were taken during hospitalization to manage her substance addiction, which included detoxification with the CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol) protocol, encouragement to stop drinking, and medication changes. The rest of the response options, options B-E, are incorrect as they incorrectly represent the frequency, substance of addiction, or the intervention taken. Consequently, they are good distractors."
100,1,18315342,"What treatment was administered for the fluid that was discovered around the patient's heart, and what was the presumed cause of this condition?",The fluid was drained via pericardiocentesis due to a suspected case of lung infection.,The fluid was removed through pericardiocentesis with the possible cause being a urinary tract infection.,"The treatment included a pericardiocentesis, and the probable cause might have been viral or due to the patient's history of breast cancer.",The patient was given medication to dissolve the fluid with the possible cause being her high blood pressure.,The fluid was removed by using a diuretic and the probable cause was suspected to be her history of heart disease.,C,"While options A, B, D, and E, include some aspects or conditions mentioned in the discharge summary, they do not accurately answer the doctor's question. A pericardiocentesis was performed (as noted in the 'Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure' section of the report) to tackle the fluid issue around the heart. The probable cause was hinted to be either viral in nature or related to the patient's history of breast cancer. The remaining options do not correctly reflect the treatment process or the possible cause of the patient's pericardial effusion according to the discharge notes."
101,1,17034816,What medication changes were made during the patient's hospital stay and what were the reasons for these changes?,The patient's Abilify was discontinued and she was put on a regimen of Lexapro 5 mg PO QD and Lamictal 25 mg PO QD because her current symptoms did not indicate the need for psychopharmacologic intervention for acute psychosis or mania.,The patient's dose of Gabapentin was doubled as she was suffering from neuropathic pain due to her history of carpal tunnel syndrome.,The patient's dose of Omeprazole was halved to reduce her symptoms of GERD.,The patient was taken off her home regimen of Gabapentin 1200 mg PO BID and started on a stronger painkiller as she was struggling with chronic pain from carpal tunnel syndrome.,The patient was put on additional antipsychotic medications to manage her worsening symptoms of psychosis.,A,"The changes made to the patient's medication during her hospital stay were the discontinuation of Abilify and the start of a regimen of Lexapro 5 mg PO QD and Lamictal 25 mg PO QD. This was because her symptoms did not indicate the need for psychopharmacologic intervention for acute psychosis or mania, as was initially believed (as provided in the note). This makes option A the correct choice. Options B, C, D, and E were distractors which contained elements from the same note but did not answer the question correctly. For instance, although the patient was indeed on a home regimen of Gabapentin 1200 mg PO BID due to her carpal tunnel syndrome (as mentioned in option D), there was no evidence in the note suggesting this was discontinued or replaced with a stronger painkiller, making this option incorrect. All the incorrect options were based on information found in the note but did not accurately answer the question asked, making them effective distractors."
102,1,19471057,"What medications was the patient taking upon admission, and were there any alterations in the medications provided at discharge?","The patient had been taking Celexa, Neurontin, Lamictal, Seroquel, Vistaril, Tegretol XR, Motrin, Trazodone, and Augmentin upon admission and she was given all the same medicines upon discharge.","The patient had been admistered Celexa, Neurontin, Lamictal, Seroquel, Vistaril, Tegretol XR, Motrin, Trazodone, and Augmentin upon admission and all these were replaced with a new list of medications at discharge.","The patient was put on Celexa, Neurontin, Lamictal, Seroquel, Vistaril, Tegretol XR, Motrin, Trazodone, and Augmentin upon admission, and the medication was consistently maintained without change throughout her hospital stay with no alterations in the medications at discharge.",The patient had refused all medications upon admission but was given a set of medications upon discharge.,The patient was under no medication upon admission and was given no medications upon discharge.,C,"Option A, B, D, and E are incorrect because the medications during admission and at discharge were not exactly the same as indicated in option A, B. The patient did not refuse medication upon admission as suggested in D, and was definitely on medication both at admission and discharge, eliminating option E. Option C is correct because it accurately paraphrases the contents of the patient's medications upon admission and discharge. The patient's medications upon admission included Celexa, Neurontin, Lamictal, Seroquel, Vistaril, Tegretol XR, Motrin, Trazodone, and Augmentin. At the time of discharge, the patient was issued a slightly adjusted list of medications, but the changes were minor— most likely in dosage and not in the actual medication. Thus, there had not been a significant ""alteration"" in medications upon discharge."
103,1,12629437,"What should be the follow-up approach with regards to the ""indeterminate segment II liver lesion"" noted on CT imaging during the patient's last admission, as per the note charted on 2186-10-30?",The patient should undergo a CT scan for further assessment.,The patient should have a biopsy of the liver lesion.,"There is no immediate need for follow-up, but the condition should be observed if the patient's symptoms worsen.",The patient should have an abdominal ultrasound for a more detailed examination of the liver lesion.,The patient should be referred for surgical removal of the liver lesion.,D,"The discharge summary notes significant findings on the CT scan for the patient's liver lesion. While the exact cause of the lesion remains undetermined, the doctor recommended an abdominal ultrasound for further characterization. Although the other choices are plausible follow-up exams or procedures for a liver lesion, they are incorrect in this case as they do not align with the doctor's specific advice in the discharge summary."
104,1,12787506,What might be the cause of the patient's recurring abdominal pain?,An allergic reaction to the patient's medication like morphine and Bactrim,Ongoing complications from the spleen removal surgery,Infected gallbladder,"Overdosing on narcotics, specifically the oxycodone medication that the patient is taking",Consequences of an abnormal metabolism indicated by the Lipase 65 result in the laboratories,B,"The patient's recurring abdominal pain is attributed to continuing complications from the splenectomy procedure, as indicated in the 'History of Present Illness', 'Abdominal pain' under 'Active issues', and detailed in the 'Discharge instructions'. The patient describes it as having her ""organs stuck together"". Options A, C, D, and E, while they contain contents that were mentioned in the patient's discharge summary, are distractors because they do not accurately answer the question about the cause of the patient's abdominal pain. Option A is wrong because an allergic reaction may cause other symptoms, but not necessarily abdominal pain. Option C is incorrect as the patient has had her gallbladder surgically removed, as mentioned multiple times in her medical history. Although the patient did undergo considerable narcotics usage (as stated in Option D), her abdominal pains were not attributed to an overdose. Lastly, while the report included a Lipase 65 result indicating a normal pancreatic function, it's not linked to the patient's abdominal pain as suggested in Option E."
105,1,11874424,"What cardiac conditions did the patient have, what was the treatment plan administered, and what were the subsequent developments leading to the patient's demise?","The patient had Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia and cardiogenic shock. The treatment was done by placing the device Impella and stents in the coronary artery. But, the patient passed away due to VT storm leading to a code.","The patient developed an apical thrombus for which he was given Statin and his medication compliance was an issue. Eventually, the patient succumbed to death due to a stroke.",The patient had high blood pressure and was administered hypertension drug. The patient later died due to kidney failure.,"The patient functionally had a triple vessel disease and was treated using dual impella devices followed by Intensive Unit Care. However, cardiogenic shock led to the patient's death.",The patient had a history of Hypertension and suffered a stroke. The treatment was done by managing his high blood pressure with oral antihypertensives. The cause of his demise was Prostate cancer.,A,"The discharge note mentions these three conditions - Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia and cardiogenic shock; and the treatment measures taken to address these situations, namely insertion of a stent and placing an Impella device. The patient's subsequent developments that led to his death are also listed where it mentions about the patient suffering from VT storm leading to a code. Hormone replacement therapy mentioned in choice B, kidney failure in choice C, dual impella devices in choice, and stroke in choice E are either not part of the patient's ailment history or the cause of death or part of the treatment provided to the patient. Hence, none of them form correct information for forming the answer and are therefore, good distractors."
106,1,17591611,"What specific finding in the Patient's Neurological Examination post-craniotomy, led to the decision of the patient being ready for discharge?",The patient displayed a clear improvement in the rightward subfalcine herniation.,"The patient was oriented to person, place, and date.",The patient’s past medical history showed chronic low back pain and anxiety.,"The patient reported no nausea, vomiting, double vision, numbness, and weakness.",No pronator drift was observed. Full strength and sensation throughout were noted.,E,"The question asks for the finding from the post-craniotomy neurological exam that indicated the patient was ready for discharge. Option E is correct as it mentions that ""No pronator drift was observed. Full strength and sensation throughout were noted,"" indicating that the patient was stable. Options A, B, and D, while mentioning aspects of the patient's condition, are not directly linked with the decision about the patient's readiness for discharge. While option C offers a fact about the patient, it is regarding the patient's past medical history and is not relevant to the discharge decision based on the neurological examination post-craniotomy."
107,1,17362440,"What were the patient's alcohol and drug usage history, and when did they last partake in these substances?",The patient consumed alcohol and drugs daily for many years and last used them about a week ago.,The patient has a history of alcohol and drug usage but ceased consumption seven months back.,The patient used to consume alcohol and drugs but stopped four months ago.,The patient used to consume alcohol and drugs but hasn't taken them since five months ago.,The patient used alcohol and drugs regularly but stopped taking them about a year ago.,B,"The history in the note describes a patient with a significant history of substance abuse, including alcohol and drugs such as cocaine and heroin. The note does not provide the exact periods for substance abuse but it's implied to have been a serious, long-term issue. The patient had not taken alcohol or other drugs since the period mentioned but the exact timeline is not clear from the note; all the other choices mention specific periods which are not indicated in the summary, making them incorrect. Only option B does not specify when the patient stopped, making it the most accurate choice based on the provided information."
108,1,17572825,What could be the potential cause for the patient's dilated right ventricle on echo and pulmonary hypertension associated with her new onset atrial fibrillation?,Constant shortness of breath due to cardiomegaly and persistent pulmonary hypertension,Lightheadedness and jaw pain resulting from cardiovascular issues,"The patient's newly developed irregular heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation",Possible sleep apnea indicated by right ventricle dilatation and pulmonary hypertension,The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 and neurological complications,D,"The discharge summary mentions the patient's right ventricle dilatation and pulmonary hypertension are suggestive of possible sleep apnea. This could potentially be the underlying cause of the cardiac issues, but further investigation such as a sleep study is recommended. Choice A, B and C are not necessarily causes themselves, but symptoms/effects of the underlying problem, making them incorrect. Choice E, notwithstanding its presence as an individual complication in the patient's medical history, there is no direct linkage cited between this existing problem and the cardiac issues."
109,1,15407688,What were the surgical and invasive procedures performed on the patient and what was the surgical outcome?,The patient underwent a Mitral Valve prolapse surgery and the outcome was successful.,The patient had a facial surgery due to a severe dog bite and the result was effective.,The patient underwent a left burrhole and craniotomy hematoma evacuation and had no post-operative neurologic deficits.,The patient was treated for back pain using surgery and the outcome was effective.,The patient had a brain surgery to excise an intracranial mass and the result was successful.,C,"The patient underwent a left burrhole, craniotomy hematoma evacuation as mentioned in the line ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left burrhole, craniotomy hematoma evacuation"". The outcome of the surgery was stated in the line ""Pt had no post-operative neurologic deficits"". Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as these were not the procedures conducted on the patient as per the notes, and thus the outcomes for these are irrelevant. These options are good distractors as they link back to the patient's medical history detailed in the notes which include Mitral Valve Prolapse, facial surgery after a severe dog bite, and back pain among others, but they do not answer the specific question asked."
110,1,14361825,What was the result of the patient's EKG and what has been the treatment plan for his cardiac issues?,The patient's EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a prior inferior myocardial infarction and he was continued on his baseline medication therapy without any change.,"The patient's EKG showed sinus tachycardia along with a right bundle-branch block, and he was initiated on beta-blockers for his cardiac issues.","The patient's EKG depicted sinus bradycardia, left atrial abnormality, and a right bundle-branch block, and treatment involved discontinuing sotalol and starting dofetilide for his rhythm issue, continuing ASA and statin for his coronary artery disease (CAD), and discontinuing hydrochlorothiazide upon starting dofetilide.","The EKG of the patient indicated sinus bradycardia and left anterior fascicular block, and his treatment plan included starting him on hydrochlorothiazide for his atrial fibrillation.","The EKG of the patient exhibited sinus bradycardia, right bundle-branch block, left axis deviation indicating left anterior fascicular block and possible old inferior myocardial infarction. He was treated with sotalol for his recurrent atrial fibrillation.",C,"The discharge note shows that the patient's EKG showed sinus bradycardia, considerations of left atrial abnormality, a right bundle-branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and possible old inferior myocardial infarction. His treatment involved discontinuing sotalol due to episodes of bradycardia and starting dofetilide. His hydrochlorothiazide was stopped when he was started on dofetilide due to its potential side effect of prolonging the QT interval. His ASA (aspirin) and statin were continued for his underlying CAD. The other options are incorrect as they either incorrectly interpret the EKG results or inaccurately describe the treatment plan. For example, options D and E incorrectly state that he was continued on sotalol and started on hydrochlorothiazide, respectiveley which is not accurate based on the information provided in the discharge summary. Also, Option B incorrectly states that the patient's EKG showed sinus tachycardia, which is incorrect. Option A is incorrect since the EKG shows more than just sinus bradycardia and his treatment plan included changes to his medication therapy due to recurrent atrial fibrillation."
111,1,11142309,What was the patient's response to the prescribed treatment of doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease prior to this hospital visit?,The patient showed immediate recovery from symptoms after initiating treatment.,The patient developed a rash after taking the doxycycline.,The patient experienced morning nausea and noted that her rash abated after the treatment.,The patient's headache symptoms worsened significantly after the treatment.,The patient reported bowel changes after the initiation of the treatment.,C,"In the provided discharge summary, it is stated that after the patient was prescribed doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease, she developed morning nausea, and noted that the rash completely abated (disappeared). The other options are made up of other events or symptoms noted in the summary, but they do not correctly answer the question. For instance, the patient did develop a rash, but it was as a result of administration of ceftriaxone in the hospital (option B), the headache symptoms worsened but there's no evidence to suggest it was due to the doxycycline treatment (option D), and bowel changes are mentioned but not in relation to the treatment (option E). As for option A, the summary doesn't support that she showed immediate recovery from symptoms. Therefore, option C is correct and the others serve as good distractors."
112,1,17128910,What major surgical procedure was performed on the patient during the admission and what was the resulting diagnosis?,The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and was diagnosed with gallstones.,The patient was subjected to a laparoscopic appendectomy and was diagnosed with acute appendicitis.,The patient had a hip replacement surgery and was diagnosed with arthritis.,The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass surgery and was diagnosed with ischemic heart disease.,The patient had undergone a hysterectomy and was diagnosed with endometriosis.,B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient was admitted due to abdominal pain and underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy (a surgical procedure to remove the appendix). The resulting diagnosis after the surgical procedure was acute appendicitis. The other options, although mentioned in the summary, are incorrect as they are not related to the actual medical procedure performed or the diagnosis made."
113,1,12366992,What was the patient's cardio-related treatment during her hospital stay and what changes were made to her medication regimen upon discharge in response to her recent health episodes?,The patient's cardio treatment involved increasing her dose of omeprazole to 40mg daily.,"The patient's cardio treatment included administering furosemide to reduce extra fluid, and her prescription changes involved increasing lisinopril to 10mg daily, and adding nitroglycerin for any future chest pain.",The patient's cardio treatment involved administering ipratropium bromide mdi to control her chest pain.,The patient was administered calcium supplements to improve her cardiac function.,The patient's medication regimen was adjusted to include a higher dose of metoprolol succinate xl.,B,"After reviewing the medical report, it's clear that during her hospital stay, the patient was given a 10ml IV dose of lasix (furosemide) to diurese about 2 liters of fluid to treat her symptoms associated with her Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Upon discharge, changes to her medication regimen were made to increase her lisinopril dosage to 10mg daily for afterload reduction, and she was prescribed nitroglycerin for any future chest pain. As for the other options, while metoprolol succinate XL and omeprazole are part of patient's medication, their dose wasn't changed to address her recent health episodes, hence options A and E are incorrect. Calcium supplements (Option D) or ipratropium bromide mdi (Option C) weren't prescribed or administered relating to cardio condition during her hospital stay or upon discharge."
114,1,12705612,What were the major clinical manifestations and treatments received by the patient during the hospital stay as per the discharge note charted on 2138-10-15?,"The patient had atrial fibrillation, acute hypothyroidism, and hypertension. He was treated with regular insulin injections, a scheduled neurology check-up, and daily administration of tramadol for pain management.","The patient showed symptoms of severe shortness of breath, hypertension, and deteriorating kidney function. He was given thyroid hormone pills, beta blockers and Coumadin for anticoagulation, and was advised to reduce salt intake.","The patient had severe shortness of breath, bradycardia, and worsening kidney function. Treatments included lasix, ICD/Pacer placement, epicardial lead placement, dopamine, Coumadin for anticoagulation, and physical rehabilitation.","The patient suffered from diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and deteriorating memory recall. The treatments included aerobic exercises, medication for blood sugar control and statin therapy, and mental stimulation exercises.","The patient had symptoms of ischemic cardiomyopathy, general fatigue, and extensive body pain. He was treated with Hydrotherapy, light physical exercises, and a tranquilizing drug to counter sleeplessness.",C,"The patient's discharge note reflects symptoms of severe shortness of breath, bradycardia, and worsening kidney function. This information is implicitly encoded in option C, which mentions these symptoms specifically. The patient's treatments according to the same discharge note quickly followed and included lasix (a diuretic), ICD (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator) or pacer placement, epicardial lead placement (a surgical treatment for heart issues), dopamine (probably prescribed for its role in renal perfusion), Coumadin for anticoagulation and rehabilitation. Option A incorrectly mentions acute hypothyroidism and identifies diabetes-related treatment. Option B correctly identifies hypertension but incorrectly includes the use of thyroid hormone pills. Option D incorrectly includes memory recall problems. Finally, option E incorrectly identifies ""general fatigue"" and ""extensive body pain"" symptoms, and identifies treatments not noted in the document."
115,1,19900729,"Based on the labs and medications given at discharge, is the patient still likely to have the initial presumed diagnosis of aseptic meningitis?",The patient's medication list does include drugs for aseptic meningitis,The discharge labs reveal a positive result for lyme disease,The patient did not receive any medications for aseptic meningitis,The patient's CSF was negative for aseptic meningitis,The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis,A,"The patient was discharged with both ceftriaxone and doxycycline which are treatments for meningitis, and could point towards a presumed diagnosis of aseptic meningitis. Although the patient was primarily diagnosed with Lyme meningitis, the initial diagnosis of aseptic meningitis could still be a possibility. The other options are incorrect because the patient did receive medications for meningitis; the patient's CSF results showed signs of meningitis (though not specifically aseptic); Lyme disease is another type of meningitis different from aseptic (Option B distract because of the mixing of types of meningitis); and she was not discharged with a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis (Option E can distract as it mentions 'aseptic meningitis' which might not be true according to the given data)."
116,1,10743678,What is the patient's known allergy history?,The patient has severe allergies to certain medications.,The patient has no known allergies or adverse drug reactions.,The patient is allergic to some types of antibiotics.,The patient has a known allergy history related to food.,The patient has allergies towards pollen and dust.,B,"Within the discharge summary provided, it has been clearly stated under the 'Allergies' section as ""No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions"". This points out that the patient does not have any known allergies or adverse reactions to drugs. Thus, option B is the right answer. All other options A, C, D, and E are incorrect as they suggest an existence of an allergy(s), which contradicts the information in mention."
117,1,16038350,What type of cancer does the patient have and what treatments have been administered for it?,The patient has stomach cancer and is on a course of chemotherapy.,The patient suffers from lung cancer and has undergone radiation therapy.,"The patient has prostate and colon cancer, and is being treated with Leupron.","The patient has breast cancer, with hormonal therapy being administered.",The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and is undergoing surgery.,C,"The discharge summary indicates that the patient has a history of prostate and colon cancer and is on Leupron for the treatment of prostate cancer. The other options are not stated in the discharge summary, which excludes the mention of any other form of cancer besides prostate and colon cancer, or of any treatments besides Leupron for prostate cancer. This information directly makes options A, B, D, and E incorrect."
118,1,12180908,What was the patient's cardiac review of systems and major findings on Echo?,The patient exhibited chest pain and shortness of breath with no considerable findings on Echo.,"The patient's cardiac review was notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope; Echo revealed mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild aortic regurgitation, and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.","The patient reported chest pain, palpitations, and ankle edema, and Echo showed high-functioning ventricular systolic function.","The patient experienced dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, with Echo revealing extremely efficient cardiac function.","The patient had palpitations and ankle edema, with Echo indicating significant ventricular pathology.",B,"In the question, the doctor wants to know specifically about the patient's cardiac review of systems and major Echo findings. Option B is correct because it accurately summarizes this information from the discharge summary. The patient's cardiac review shows an absence of multiple heart-related issues, and the Echo results show mild ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The other answer options, while containing elements also found in the semantic notes, are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the correct elements of the cardiac review or the Echo results."
119,1,16343365,"What was the medication regimen for the patient upon discharge, and how does it differ from that on admission?","The patient was discharged on Haloperidol Decanoate 75 mg IM ONCE every 2 weeks and Benztropine Mesylate 1 mg PO BID. Upon admission, the patient was taking Haloperidol 10 mg PO BID, Benztropine Mesylate 1 mg PO BID, and Lorazepam 1 mg PO BID PRN for anxiety.","Upon discharge, the patient was on Lorazepam, Haloperidol, and Benztropine Mesylate. On admission, the patient was on Benztropine Mesylate and Lorazepam.","The patient was discharged on Lorazepam and Benztropine Mesylate, but on admission the patient was on Haloperidol and Benztropine Mesylate.","During discharge, the patient was on Haloperidol and Benztropine. On entry, the patient was on Lorazepam and Benztropine Mesylate.","The patient was discharged on Haloperidol and Lorazepam. On admission, the patient was on Haloperidol, Lorazepam, and Benztropine Mesylate.",A,"Option A is correct because upon discharge, the patient was only taking Haloperidol Decanoate and Benztropine Mesylate. On admission, the patient was taking Haloperidol, Lorazepam, and Benztropine Mesylate. The other options are incorrect because they vary the medications or doses given to the patient either on admission or discharge, thus do not fully or accurately reflect the information in the provided discharge summary."
120,1,14798800,What complication did the patient experience post-operatively and how was it managed?,The patient experienced unstable vital signs which was managed with medication adjustments.,The patient got pulmonary embolism and was put on anti-coagulant therapy.,The patient was diagnosed with urinary tract infection and was treated with ciprofloxacin 250mg BID for 7 days.,The patient suffered from a prolonged recovery period necessitating a prolonged hospital stay.,"The patient exhibited symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, hence a lovenox was given for DVT prophylaxis.",C,"The discharge summary states that after surgery, the patient was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The doctors managed this complication by prescribing ciprofloxacin 250mg BID for 7 days.  Option A is incorrect because patient's vitals were noted as stable, not unstable. Option B is incorrect because while a CTPE was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, the test results were negative. Option D is incorrect because the patient's recovery period is not highlighted as a problem in the discharge summary. Option E is incorrect because even though the patient received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, it was a preventive measure and not a postoperative complication. It was intended as a preventive measure rather than a treatment for an existing condition."
121,1,14062028,"What were the surgical procedures performed for the patient, as indicated in the hospital course and what complications arose postoperatively?",The surgical procedures performed included colonoscopy and endoscopy and there were no complications registered.,"Mitral valve replacement, appendectomy and angioplasty were performed and patient suffered cardiac arrest postoperatively.","The patient underwent mitral valve repair with a mitral valve annuloplasty, a modified left-sided maze procedure and a left atrial appendage resection. A re-exploration was done due to postoperative bleeding.",The procedures carried out were a kidney transplant and a carotid endarterectomy and patient had postoperative complications of hypertension.,"The patient underwent a thoracotomy procedure and an esophagectomy, but suffered from respiratory complications postoperatively.",C,"As per the discharge summary provided mentioning the major surgical or invasive procedures, the patient underwent three procedures: 1. Mitral valve repair along with a mitral valve annuloplasty using a 28 mm Physio II annuloplasty ring. 2. A modified left-sided maze procedure was done. 3. The patient also had left atrial appendage resection. The complication which arose postoperatively was excess drainage from the chest tube which suggested bleeding. Therefore, the patient was taken for re-exploration for bleeding. The other options are incorrect and could serve as distractors as they mention unrelated procedures and complications that are not indicated anywhere in this specific patient's discharge summary."
122,1,19947156,What were the significant findings on the patient's cardiac catheterization? Has there been any changes in medication post-catheterization?,The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed mild coronary artery disease and no changes were made to their medication.,"The cardiac catheterization showed three vessel native coronary artery disease and significant stenosis in vein grafts to OM and RCA, requiring the placement of drug-eluting stents. Following the procedure, the patient was started on Metroporol and Aspirin, and their Pravastatin level was increased.","The patient had cardiac catheterization that showed no significant findings, and his medication remained the same.","The cardiac catheterization revealed generalized heart blockage, thus, new heart medications were initiated.","The cardiac catheterization procedure unveiled myocardial infarction. However, the patient's medication was not addressed.",B,"Choice B is correct because, as the discharge summary states, the patient had three vessel native coronary artery disease and severe stenosis vein grafts to OM and RCA. This required stenting and after the procedure, the patient's medication was adjusted with an addition of Metoprolol and Aspirin, and an increase in Pravastatin dosage.   Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect but suitable distractors as they all reference elements from the patient’s discharge summary. Option A minimizes the severity of the illness and falsely states no medication changes. Option C incorrectly asserts no significant findings in the cardiac catheterization and no medication changes. Option D exaggerates the findings from the cardiac catheterization. And finally, option E correctly states that myocardial infarction was found, but inaccurately states that there were no changes in medication."
123,1,10808949,"What change was made to the patient's medication regimen during this hospital stay, and why?",The patient's Sinemet dosage was increased to manage Parkinsonism symptoms.,"The patient was advised to stop taking several medications including Sinemet, Chantix, Alprazolam, Amitriptyline, Oxycodone, and gabapentin due to their possible connection to his hallucinations and mental status anomaly.",All medications were ceased due to unresponsiveness to treatment.,The patient's COPD medications were altered to manage his dyspnea.,The patient started taking a new medication for hypertension.,B,"From the discharge summary, it is seen that several medicines including Sinemet, Chantix, Alprazolam, Amitriptyline, Oxycodone, and gabapentin were stopped during the patient’s hospital stay. This was as a result of the patient experiencing hallucinations and changes in mental status, likely caused by the combination of these medicines. Thus, B is the right answer. The other options, although they involve the patient's medical conditions or medicines mentioned in the notes, do not correctly answer the question asked by the doctor. 1. Option A is incorrect. The patient was stopped from taking Sinemet. 2. Option C is wrong. Not all of the patient’s medications were stopped. 3. Option D is not right. The patient continued to use his regular COPD medicines. 4. Option E is incorrect because there is no newly prescribed drugs for hypertension."
124,1,18010427,What was the cause of the patient's GI bleeding during their visit on 2113-03-11 and what treatment was suggested to the patient?,"The patient's GI bleeding was caused by diverticulosis, and they were advised to continue with their usual medication and incorporate iron supplements into their diet.","The patient's GI bleeding was due to severe migraines, and they were prescribed progesterone to treat it.","The patient had GI bleeding as a side effect of hypertension, and was prescribed Lisinopril to control it.","The patient's GI bleeding was caused by an ulcer due to NSAID overuse, and the treatment involved administering Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) therapy.","The patient's GI bleed was a result of colon cancer, and they were recommended to undergo an immediate surgery.",D,"The discharge summary notes that the patient's GI bleeding was caused by ""NSAID-induced ulcers in the stomach and duodenum"" and was put on a treatment of ""pantoprazole 40 mg q12 hrs to be continued at discharge for 8 weeks"". Options A, B, C, and E are incorrect even though they mention conditions or treatments that appear in the discharge summary. The patient does have a history of diverticulosis (A), migraines (B), and hypertension (C), but these were not stated as the causes of their GI bleeding. Also, there was no mention of the patient having colon cancer (E)."
125,1,15396789,"What was the detected drug in the patient's urine tox screening when admitted to the hospital on 2157-03-17, and what major medical procedures were performed at that time due to his condition?",The urine tox screening revealed traces of marijuana and the patient was put under the procedure of sedation using propofol and versed.,The urine tox screening showed the presence of LSD and the patient underwent a procedure of endotracheal intubation.,The patient's urine tox screening showed the presence of cocaine and he underwent an endotracheal intubation procedure due to his condition.,He had a significant amount of Adderall detected in the urine tox screening and was immediately put onto a D5W drip with bicarbonate.,The urine tox screening revealed traces of a pure form of NMDA and the patient had to be extubated due to his condition.,C,"The patient's urine tox screening was positive for cocaine as per the medical records from his admission on 2157-03-17 (note 1). Due to his condition, he was subjected to an endotracheal intubation procedure. Answers A, B, D, and E are incorrect because the urine tox screening did not test positive for marijuana, LSD, Adderall, or a pure form of NMDA when the patient was admitted to the hospital. The medical procedures mentioned in these options, such as sedation using propofol and versed, are also incorrect, as they did not occur in context with the patient's condition at the time of admission."
126,1,19150130,What were the main causes of the patient's significant worsening in his oxygen requirement and the ultimate decision to make the patient CMO?,The patient's oxygen requirement worsened due to mild fever side effect of Apixaban.,"Worsening liver failure, multiple systemic organ failure (MSOF), and nonresponse to treatments led to the decision to transition the patient to comfort measures only (CMO)",The patient's oxygen requirement significantly increased due to common side-effects of Atorvastatin.,Increased oxygen requirement occurred due to allergic reaction from medications such as Gabapentin and PredniSONE.,The patient's significant worsening in his oxygen requirement was due to abnormal bruising and ecchymoses.,B,"The discharge summary outlines in the hospital course that the patient profoundly worsened, indicating that he had liver failure, renal failure, and multiple systemic organ failure (MSOF). His condition did not improve despite extensive treatment and diuresis. Therefore, the family decided to make the patient CMO. The other options A, C, D, and E are incorrect as there is no direct evidence in the summary that connects these aspects to the increased oxygen requirement or decision for CMO. These distractors were chosen as the patient was indeed on the medications or had the symptoms, but they were not the primary cause for the worsening condition and decision for CMO."
127,1,14305964,What is the patient's discharge medication regimen and what changes were made compared to their medication on admission?,The patient was discharged with the same medication regimen as at admission.,The medication atorvastatin was halted upon the patient's discharge.,"Diltiazem Extended-Release 120 mg and Rivaroxaban 20 mg were added to the patient's medication regimen upon discharge, and the dosage of Atorvastatin was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg.",The patient was discharged with a completely new medication regimen.,Ibuprofen and Ascorbic Acid were added to the patient's medication regimen upon discharge.,C,"The correct answer is C, as it accurately reflects the changes in the patient's medication regimen upon discharge as given in the provided notes, 'DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS'. Atorvastatin was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg, and Diltiazem Extended-Release 120 mg and Rivaroxaban 20 mg were added. The other choices, A, B, D and E do not accurately reflect the changes in the medication regimen upon discharge. They could be good distractors as they propose different possible scenarios that would involve changes in the medication regimen. Nevertheless, in this case, those changes did not happen."
128,1,15769426,What is the primary diagnosis for the patient's visual symptoms and what is the major surgical/invasive procedure that was undertaken during her stay in the hospital?,The patient was diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis and underwent an Ophthalmic Artery Biopsy.,The patient was diagnosed with Sinusitis and underwent a Sinus Surgery.,The patient was diagnosed with TMJ Dysfunction and underwent a Jaw Surgery.,The patient was diagnosed with Giant Cell Arteritis and underwent a Left Temporal Artery Biopsy.,The patient was diagnosed with Ischemic Optic Neuropathy and underwent an Optic Nerve Surgery,D,"The discharge summary reports that the primary diagnosis of the patient's visual symptoms was 'Giant Cell Arteritis'. The major surgical or invasive procedure that she underwent was a 'Left Temporal Artery Biopsy'. The other options (B, C, E) are incorrect because these conditions were not the diagnosed disease nor the procedures performed as per the information from the discharge summary. While Temporal Arteritis is another name for Giant Cell Arteritis (option A), the specific procedure performed was a Left Temporal Artery Biopsy, not an Ophthalmic Artery Biopsy. Hence, answer D is the most accurate."
129,1,16729729,What procedure was performed on the patient during his first ERCP to manage cystic duct leak post-cholecystectomy and what was the resulting diagnosis when he returned with abdominal pain afterwards?,The patient underwent a sphincterotomy and a stent was placed in the hepatic duct. The patient was later diagnosed with pancreatitis post-ERCP.,The patient underwent a stent placement in the cystic duct. The patient was later diagnosed with pancreatitis post-ERCP.,The patient had a biliary stent placement and drain removal. He was later diagnosed with cholecystitis post-ERCP.,The patient underwent JP drain removal. He returned with abdominal pain and was diagnosed with GERD.,"The patient had a catheter placement. Later, the patient returned with abdominal pain and was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.",A,"The discharge summary mentions that during the patient's initial ERCP, a successful sphincterotomy was performed and a stent was placed in the common bile duct (CBD). The patient later returns with abdominal pain post-ERCP and is subsequently diagnosed with pancreatitis (acute pancreatitis). B, C and E are distractors that mention other procedures and diagnoses noted in the discharge summary but are not directly related to the ERCP or the post-ERCP diagnosis. D is a distractor as it mentions JP drain removal, but the resulting diagnosis for the abdominal pain was pancreatitis, not GERD."
130,1,10108418,What was the physician's post-discharge instruction regarding the patient's narcotics medication and what rationale was given?,The patient was advised to immediately discontinue her narcotics regimen due to suspected narcotic bowel syndrome.,"The physician recommended a slight decrease in the dosage of her narcotics, owing to their diminishing effectiveness.",The patient was advised to slowly wean from her opiate regimen and replace them with alternative pain modalities due to a potential diagnosis of narcotic bowel syndrome.,The physician suggested the patient should increase her narcotics regimen since she believes that the drugs are losing effect.,"It was recommended that the patient continues her existing regimen without modification, as it was deemed effective in managing her symptoms.",C,"The discharge summary indicates the physician's instruction to the patient was to slowly wean from her opiate regimen due to a potential diagnosis of narcotic bowel syndrome. Answer Choice A is incorrect because the summary does not suggest an immediate discontinuation. Answer Choice B is incorrect since there is no mention of a slight decrease in dosage; instead, they've been advised to slowly wean off. Answer Choice D is incorrect because it suggests an increase in the narcotics regimen which is contradictory to what was advised. Answer Choice E is incorrect as the physician deemed adjustments to the medication regimen necessary, not considering it efficient as it stands."
131,1,12032239,"What was the decision regarding the patient's code status, and what specific treatments did she refuse as per the discharge summary charted on 2174-12-21?",The patient decided that she would be in full code status and refused dialysis,The patient consented to both Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate (DNR/DNI) status and the refusal of a central line even if it was lifesaving,"The patient agreed to be tagged under Do Not Resuscitate status only, however, consented to having a central line",The patient agreed to intubation but refused to be under a Do Not Resuscitate status,The patient refused to make any decisions regarding her code status,B,"The discharge summary for the patient on 2174-12-21 states that she confirmed her status as a DNR/DNI. Additionally, she declined the option for a central line even if it was to be lifesaving. Options A, C, D and E are incorrect as they do not correctly reflect the patient's decisions on code status and specific treatments that she refused. This data can be found in the notes under 'History of Present Illness' where it says ""code status was discussed with patient who stated DNR/DNI and that she doesnt want central line even if lifesaving."""
132,1,18976454,"What surgical procedure was performed during the patient's stay, and what were the post-operative findings?",The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have no significant coronary disease.,The patient underwent a Bentall procedure with a 23mm freestyle tissue graft and a 26mm Gelweave tube graft with a sidearm.,"The patient received an aortic valve replacement, and post-operative checks revealed severe aortic regurgitation.","A respiratory BiPAP procedure was performed, and the patient's breathing improved significantly.",The patient received a cardiac stent placement and showed no signs of complications post-operation.,B,"According to the notes, the patient underwent a Bentall procedure, which involves replacement of the aortic valve, aortic root, and ascending aorta. A 23mm freestyle tissue graft and a 26mm Gelweave tube graft with a sidearm were used. The patient’s recovery was successful as she was found ambulating freely, the wound was healing, and her pain was well-managed with oral analgesics by the time of discharge. This is why option B is correct.   Option A is incorrect because although cardiac catheterization was performed, it is not a surgical procedure. Option C is incorrect because the patient did not just receive a standard aortic valve replacement, but a more complex procedure known as a Bentall procedure. Following this, there's no mention of severe aortic regurgitation. Option D is incorrect because no invasive BiPAP procedure was performed -- it was only used as a therapeutic device to assist with the patient's breathing. Option E is wrong because there was no mention of a cardiac stent placement for the patient. All incorrect options could be seen as compelling due to their relevance to the patient's cardiac condition, making them good distractors."
133,1,17067578,"What is the primary diagnosis made during the patient's discharge during the hospitalization charted on 2130-06-03, and what medication was prescribed to him upon discharge?",The main diagnosis was ventricular tachycardia and the medicine recommended upon discharge was Prozac.,"Depression was the main diagnosis, and the patient was advised to continue Prozac after being discharged.",The patient was primarily diagnosed with OCD and he was discharged with risperidone medication.,"The primary diagnosis was psychosis, possibly schizophrenia, and he was prescribed risperidone 3 mg tablets on discharge.",The diagnosis made was dysthymic disorder and the patient was prescribed risperidone at the time of discharge.,D,"According to the discharge summary, the patient was given a preliminary diagnosis of psychosis, with the possibility of schizophrenia. Following his stay, he was prescribed risperidone 3 mg tablets. While there is a mention of OCD (option C), ventricular tachycardia (option A), and depression (option B), these were not the main diagnoses; also, Prozac was taken previously, not prescribed upon discharge. Option E is incorrect as dysthymia was a mood described by the patient, not the main diagnosis."
134,1,11741591,"What medication was the patient prescribed to manage her C. diff infection, and were any changes made during her hospital stay?","The patient was prescribed a course of furosemide to manage her C. diff infection, and it was not changed during her hospital stay.","The patient was administered metoprolol tartrate 100 mg to counteract her C. diff infection, but it was changed to PO vancomycin during her hospital stay.","The patient was given flagyl to manage her C. diff infection initially, and it was switched to PO vancomycin and IV metronidazole during her hospital stay.","The patient was on Levothyroxine Sodium for her C. diff infection, but it was replaced with apixaban during her hospital stay.",The patient was put on a regimen of PO flagyl for her C. diff infection and this medication was not changed during her hospital stay.,C,"From the discharge summary, it is clear that the patient was initially using flagyl to treat her C. diff infection. However, during her hospital stay, the medication was switched to PO vancomycin and IV metronidazole for the management of her C. diff infection. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect, but they are good distractors as they mention drugs that the patient was actually on but not for the management of C. diff infection. Moreover, the patient's medication was indeed changed during her hospital stay, which makes option E a good distractor."
135,1,10952939,What is the reason for the patient's hypotension and did it resolve over the course of the hospital stay?,The patient's hypotension was due to her intake of NSAIDs and it resolved after she quit taking these drugs.,"The patient's hypotension was caused by missing a Remicade infusion, but it resolved after hospitalization.","The patient's hypotension was prompted by the treatment for changes in her EKG, and it didn't resolve during her hospital stay.","Lack of exercise led to the patient's hypotension, and it resolved once she started moving around.",The patient's hypotension resulted from her anxiety condition and it resolved after she received mental health support.,A,"The note indicates that the hypotension was associated with the intake of NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) by the patient in response to her missing a Remicade infusion. The patient had been experiencing side effects since starting these drugs, and had also been found to have hypotension. This information leads to option A being correct. The note also states that her blood pressure was stable at the time of discharge, hence the hypotension had resolved during her hospital stay.  Options B and C are incorrect as they do not correctly identify the cause of hypotension.  Option D and E are not valid as they draw from pieces of the patient's medical history (anklyosing spondylitis and anxiety) which don't have a direct correlation to the cause of the patient's hypotension."
136,1,12128502,"What injuries did the patient sustain as a result of his fall, as revealed by the first CT scan findings?",The patient fractured his left elbow.,The patient suffered a dislocated shoulder.,The patient sustained fractures in several of his ribs on the left side along with a moderate left pneumothorax.,The patient developed a bone island in the T4 vertebral body.,The patient had calcification along the anterior longitudinal ligament.,C,"According to the provided discharge summary, the patient had fractures of the posterior left sixth through 10th ribs and a moderate left pneumothorax as a result of his fall. This is directly mentioned in the patient's CT scan findings section of the discharge summary. Other answer choices were mentioned in the CT scan findings, but were not the cause of the patient's fall. For example, the patient did have calcification along the anterior longitudinal ligament and a bone island in the T4 vertebral body, but this is unrelated to the fall. Answer choices A and B, mentioning an elbow fracture and dislocated shoulder, do not appear anywhere in the provided discharge summary, making them incorrect answer choices for this question."
137,1,17738151,What pathological findings were reported on the patient's Transthoracic Echocardiography?,Minor dilation in the left atrium with significant right ventricular hypertrophy,No dilation in aorta with two aortic valve leaflets,Moderate stenosis and regurgitation in the aortic valve along with normal function in left ventricle,Hypertrophy in right ventricle with severe dysfunction of both ventricles,Insignificant constriction on the aortic valve and significant tricuspid valve regurgitation,C,"The discharge summary indicates that the patient's Transthoracic Echocardiography revealed moderate aortic valve stenosis and regurgitation, along with normal functioning in the left ventricle, which matches with Option C. Option A is incorrect as there's no significant right ventricular hypertrophy reported. Option B is false because there are three leaflets in aortic valve, not two and the ascending aorta is mildly dilated. Option D is incorrect because there was no hypertrophy or dysfunction reported in the right ventricle. Option E is incorrect as moderate stenosis was reported and the tricuspid valve regurgitation was reported to be mild, not significant."
138,1,18732888,What was the reason for the patient's discontinuation of coumadin in the past?,The patient discontinued coumadin due to a significant allergic reaction.,The patient ceased taking coumadin due to ineffectiveness for her condition.,The patient had discontinued her coumadin intake after a fall that led to a head injury.,The patient discontinued coumadin because of developing atrial fibrillation.,The patient was advised to discontinue coumadin due to a high INR reading.,C,"The documentation states that a prior incident resulted in the patient discontinuing coumadin. The incident involved the patient passing out, falling, and hitting her head. Of the other options, none can be substantiated from the provided notes; they depict scenarios that, although potentially valid reasons for stopping coumadin, were not given in the context of this particular patient's history. For example, she did not have an allergic reaction (A), the coumadin was not proven to be ineffective (B), the patient did have atrial fibrillation but it was not the reason for discontinuing coumadin (D), and while the INR in the discharge summary was high, it was not mentioned as a reason for discontinuing coumadin (E)."
139,1,10974265,What was the finding in the CTA Chest that was performed during the patient's stay and what was the recommended course of action?,The CTA Chest showed Pulmonary Hypertension with recommendation for Cardiac Catheterization.,The CTA Chest found an Occlusion of the left vertebral artery from its origin and suggests monitoring disease activity.,The CTA Chest showed Moderate Atherosclerosis with suggested addition of ACE inhibitor.,The CTA Chest revealed Solid left renal lesion with recommendation for MRI for further evaluation.,The CTA Chest displayed Extensive scarring in both apices and lung bases with suggested follow-up with PCP.,D,"In the discharge summary, the CTA Chest (Computed Tomography Angiography) for this patient showed a solid left renal lesion, and the doctors recommend that this might be a renal cell carcinoma that needs further MRI evaluation (Choice D). Although choices A, B, C and E are facts included in the patient's summary, they are incorrect as they do not answer the doctor's question appropriately. Choice A is incorrect as it refers to a feature found in Echo not CTA Chest. In choice B, the CTA chest indeed found an occlusion of the left vertebral artery but no recommendation was specified for it. Choice C, while it refers to a finding in the CTA Chest, the recommendation was not according to the CTA Chest findings. Choice E is about scarring noticed in CTA Chest, however, it did not include a recommendation. Therefore, choice D is the best answer as it correctly outlines the findings and the associated recommendation mentioned in the CTA Chest conducted."
140,1,19277371,What course of treatment was implemented by the neurology department to address the patient's cranial nerve III palsy?,The patient was prescribed Penicillins and Ambien to alleviate the symptoms related to cranial nerve III palsy.,"The patient was given thiamine, folate and multivitamin to treat the cranial nerve III palsy.",The patient was started on Aspirin therapy to manage the cranial nerve III palsy.,Physical therapy was commenced to directly address the cranial nerve III palsy symptoms.,Furosemide and Carvedilol were administered as the primary treatment for the cranial nerve III palsy.,C,"In the report, the patient was diagnosed with a cranial nerve III palsy and was started on aspirin therapy. Although all the other treatments (A, B, D, and E) were given, they were used to address different issues--not the cranial nerve III palsy. Penicillins and Ambien (A) were listed as allergies and not a form of treatment. Thiamine, folate, and multivitamin (B) were given for the patient's history of daily alcohol use. Physical therapy (D) was recommended due to the patient's need for 24-hour supervision and home safety evaluation. Furosemide and Carvedilol (E) were part of his medication regime, but not specifically linked to treating the cranial nerve III palsy. Thus, these distractors are incorrect but still plausible because they are mentioned in the patient's treatment plan."
141,1,16756034,What were the significant surgical procedures that the patient underwent during her hospital stay?,The patient underwent endoscopy and laparoscopic removal of the gallbladder.,The patient was subjected to elbow surgery during her stay.,"The patient was treated with medication, Losartan Potassium during her stay.",The patient underwent cholecystectomy for her hypertension.,The patient was treated for obesity through bariatric surgery.,A,"According to the discharge summary, the patient underwent ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) which is a procedure to diagnose and treat problems in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, and pancreas and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the surgical removal of the gallbladder making option A the correct one. Option B states that the patient had elbow surgery, which is incorrect according to the discharge summary - this was part of her past medical history, and not something that occurred during her hospital stay. Option C is incorrect because although Losartan Potassium was a medication administered to the patient during her stay, it is not a surgical procedure. Option D is wrong because the patient didn’t undergo a cholecystectomy due to hypertension, but due to gallstones. Option E is incorrect because there is no mention of bariatric surgery in the discharge summary. It only mentions that the patient had a high BMI indicating obesity."
142,1,18396142,What was the reason for the patient's sudden loss of balance and confusional state and how was this condition managed?,"The patient had an episode of a stroke, which was managed by performing a major surgical procedure.","The patient had an epileptic seizure, which was handled through antiepileptic medication.","The patient had a presyncopal episode of cardiac origin, managed by modifying her cardiac medications and enhancing her Lasix dosage.","The patient had an acute infarction, managed by executing an invasive procedure.","The patient experienced a psychological breakdown due to her dementia, managed by increasing intake of dementia-specific medication.",C,"The patient's sudden loss of balance and confusional state were triggered by a presyncopal episode with a cardiac cause, likely related to her known critical aortic stenosis (as mentioned in the discharge diagnosis). This was determined after examinations like the CT and MRI scan ruled out stroke, and an EEG showed no seizures. The patient's medications were adjusted to manage the issue: Metoprolol and Digoxin were discontinued, and the dosage of Lasix (Furosemide) was increased. The incorrect options A, B, D and E are misleading because while the patient was evaluated for both stroke and seizure, neither were found to be the cause of her symptoms, nor were any surgical or invasive procedures performed. Additionally, her dementia was not the direct cause of the episode."
143,1,16016177,"What was the patient's presentation, the primary diagnosis, and the recommended treatment plan upon discharge?","The patient experienced back pain, was diagnosed with herniated disc in the low back, and was prescribed physiotherapy.","The patient presented with chest pain, was diagnosed with ST elevation myocardial infarction, and was prescribed Aspirin, Simvastatin, Metoprolol, Plavix, and Lisinopril.","The patient displayed symptoms of diaphoresis and diarrhea, was diagnosed with gastroenteritis, and was given IV fluids and rest.","The patient experienced shortness of breath, was diagnosed with pulmonary nodules, and was recommended for outpatient follow-up in three months with a repeat high res chest CT.","The patient experienced chest pain, was diagnosed with aortic dissection, and was begun on a regimen of nitro paste, morphine, IVF and a heparin drip.",B,"From the discharge summary, it is clear that the patient was admitted for chest pain and subsequently diagnosed with ST elevation myocardial infarction. The recommended treatment plan includes daily doses of Aspirin, Simvastatin, Metoprolol XL, Plavix, and Lisinopril. Option A is incorrect as it mentions a previous ailment, not the present issue leading to the hospital visit. Option C is not correct, the patient did not have symptoms of gastric problems but had chest pains. Option D is a good distractor but is not the primary reason for the hospitalization - the pulmonary nodules were an incidental finding. Option E is similarly incorrect since the patient had STEMI and not aortic dissection-importantly, the patient was initially feared to have aortic dissection, but tests ruled it out. Hence, the correct answer is option B."
144,1,13806858,What were the possible etiologies of the patient's cardiac arrest as per the assessment information in the note charted on 2186-01-07?,The patient suffered a cardiac arrest due to an opioid overdose.,The patient's cardiac arrest was brought on by severe multifocal pneumonia or possibly diffuse alveolar damage/ARDS.,The cause of the patient's cardiac arrest could be attributed to her Type 2 Diabetes.,The possible causes of the patient's cardiac arrest include an irregular heartbeat or a potentially underlying infectious illness.,The patient's cardiac arrest was caused by physical trauma to the chest region.,D,"Based on the information provided, the attending notes suggest that the arrest could potentially be due to an underlying infection or an arrhythmia. While the patient does have Type 2 diabetes and severe multifocal pneumonia (Answer Choices B and C), these conditions are not directly stated as potential causes of cardiac arrest in the notes. Answer A is incorrect as the urine toxicology results were negative, specifying no drug overdose caused the cardiac arrest. Answer E has no basis in the information provided, as there was no mention of any physical trauma."
145,1,17250315,"What was the discharge diagnosis for the patient admitted on 2185-10-25, and what noteworthy signs or symptoms led to that conclusion?","The patient was diagnosed with a severe headache, and the symptoms noted were numbness and tingling in the limbs.","The patient was diagnosed with asthma, and his recurring respiratory issues led to this conclusion.","The discharge diagnosis was complex migraine, based on the severe headache and global aphasia he presented with.","The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, based on his medical history of abdominal discomfort and irregular bowel movements.","The patient was diagnosed with a stroke, as evinced by the global aphasia and severe headache he presented with.",C,"The discharge diagnosis for the patient, as mentioned in the discharge summary, was a complex migraine. This conclusion was reached primarily due to the severe headache and global aphasia symptoms that the patient presented with. In contrast, answer A is incorrect because the patient exhibited global aphasia (a condition affecting the production or comprehension of speech), but not numbness and tingling in the limbs. Answer B is incorrect because while the patient had a previous history of asthma, it was not the discharge diagnosis from this particular admittance. Answer D, although Crohn's disease was in the patient's medical history, it was not the cause of this particular hospital admission. Answer E is incorrect because although stroke was initially suspected, the follow-up MRI did not confirm it, and the finally settled diagnosis was a complex migraine. All these options are good distractors because they include plausible symptoms or conditions related to the patient's condition or personal history."
146,1,16840956,What was the provisional diagnosis of the lesion observed in the patient's brain and what further investigation was recommended?,"The lesion was diagnosed as a left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and a follow-up MRI was suggested.","The lesion diagnosed was a hyperdensity in the left temporal lobe, and a follow-up ultrasound was recommended.","The lesion was diagnosed as a R head and eye deviation with R arm jerking, and a cervical spine MRI was recommended.","The lesion observed in the patient's brain was diagnosed as a moderate vertebral canal stenosis at C3-4 level, and a Metastatic disease investigation was suggested.","The lesion was diagnosed as a L corneal infection, and a repeat of head CT was suggested.",A,"The discharge summary explicitly mentions that the patient had a ""left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage"" [Left Parieto-Occipital IPH section]. Further, under 'Transitional Issues', the medical team recommends a repeat brain MRI to assess for an underlying mass. Option B is incorrect as the hyperdensity in the left temporal lobe was not the primary concern, and it isn't recommended that they follow-up with an ultrasound. Option C refers to a seizure event, not the diagnosis of the lesion. Option D incorrectly names the lesion and suggests an unrelated follow-up. Option E discusses an unrelated condition (L corneal infection), and the follow-up mentioned is unrelated to understanding the brain lesion (head CT is not the same as MRI)."
147,1,15465589,"What medications was the patient prescribed on discharge, and for what likely indications?",The patient was advised to take celexa and seroquel for treating depression and anxiety.,The patient has been prescribed wellbutrin and citalopram for addressing financial stressors and relationship stressors.,The medications prescribed on discharge were wellbutrin and quetiapine for depression and stress management.,The patient has been administered celexa and quetiapine for the treatment of trigger finger.,The patient was prescribed citalopram and quetiapine to overcome suicidal tendencies.,A,"Towards the end of the note, under the subheading ""Discharge Medications"" it is clear the patient was prescribed citalopram (also known as celexa) which is an antidepressant and quetiapine (also known as seroquel) for anxiety and sleep. Wellbutrin was what the patient was on before the start of his hospital stay (as mentioned under ""Medications on Admission"") but it was discontinued once he was admitted. Hence, option A accurately reflects the information in the note while the other options provide incorrect interpretations. For example, option B and C incorrectly stated that the patient was prescribed wellbutrin, option D mentioned the treatment of trigger finger (which the patient had already completed earlier), and option E associated the prescription to suicidal tendencies which isn't mentioned as a treatment indication in the note."
148,1,12346890,What was the primary surgical or invasive procedure conducted for the patient during her visit as documented on 2177-10-15?,The patient had a stent trial with 3 metal stents placed.,The patient had a biopsy which showed noncaseating granulomas.,The patient underwent a thoracotomy and tracheobronchoplasty with mesh along with a bronchoscopy with lavage.,"The patient was treated with chest ___, nebulizers and incentive spirometry.",The patient underwent bronchothermoplasty.,C,"Option C is the correct answer, as on the date specified, the patient's main procedures were right thoracotomy, tracheobronchoplasty with mesh, and bronchoscopy with lavage as stated in the summary. Option A is incorrect, there's mention of a past stent trial, but the date does not coincide with the question. Option B is a medical fact about the patient, but the biopsy didn't occur on the stated date. Option D and E do not fit as well because they are either regular treatments the patient goes through or procedures conducted in the past; neither are the primary procedures conducted on the date specified in the question."
149,1,17492675,"What were the results of the patient's exercise nuclear stress test during the admission on 2114-06-10, and what was concluded?",The patient exercised insufficiently and displayed severe chest pains.,The patient's stress test showed a high risk of future cardiac events despite normal myocardial perfusion.,The test demonstrated that the patient had diffusion defects and abnormal ECG changes.,The patient showed uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium with normal wall motion and an average left ventricular ejection fraction.,"The test revealed that the patient had an abnormal systolic function, and immediate surgery was recommended.",D,"In the discharge summary, it is noted under the ""Exercise Mibi"" section that the patient's stress and resting perfusion images showed uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium. Their gated images revealed normal wall motion, and their left ventricular ejection fraction was at a normal 54%. These factors indicate that Answer Choice D is correct.   Answer choice A is incorrect as the patient was not reported to experience severe chest pains during the test. Instead, it was noted that no anginal type symptoms occurred. Answer B is incorrect because, while it is true that normal myocardial perfusion in diabetes patients doesn't necessarily imply a low risk of future cardiac events, the notes don't suggest that the patient's risk is high. Answer C is wrong because no diffusion defects or ECG changes were noted in the test results. Answer E is incorrect because the patient's systolic function was described as normal, and no surgery was mentioned in the discharge summary."
150,1,12988383,What was the cause of the patient's pneumonia and what was the treatment administered during her hospital stay?,The patient's pneumonia was caused by an allergic reaction and she was treated with INH and rifampin.,"The patient's pneumonia was caused by inhalation of food, liquid, or gastric acid from her stomach into her lungs and she was treated with levofloxacin and metronidazole.",The patient's pneumonia was caused by an allergic reaction to her asthma medication and she was treated with steroids.,The patient's pneumonia was caused by her asthma and she was treated with albuterol.,The patient's pneumonia was caused by her seizure disorder and she was treated with anticonvulsant medications.,B,"The notes indicate that the patient's pneumonia was caused by likely aspiration (inhalation of food, liquid, or gastric acid from the stomach into the lungs) following vomiting. Therefore, option B is correct. The patient received levofloxacin and metronidazole as treatment. The distractors, options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they mention causal factors that are not indicated in the notes. However, they were chosen as distractors because they relate to the patient's other documented medical problems (asthma and seizure disorder) or to common causes and treatments of pneumonia (allergic reactions and use of steroids or anticonvulsants)."
