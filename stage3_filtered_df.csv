History of Present Illness:
___ yo F with h/o obesity, with one day history of n/v and 
abdominal pain.  Pt had sushi for lunch on ___, then chicken & 
noodles for dinner, with a single drink.  She had gradual onset 
of epigastric pain, accompanied by nausea and three episodes of 
nonbloody emesis. She saw her PCP yesterday, who began 
procholoperazine and prilosec for possible gastritis, which 
provided only some relief.  The PCP checked her amylase (3446) 
and lipase (2816); the covering PCP referred the pt to the ED 
for further evaluation, but she felt drowsy from the antiemetic, 
so elected to wait until this am to present to the ED.

In the ED, lipase was 767.  RUQ US revealed a thin gallbladder 
filled with gallstones.  There is shadowing in the CBD c/w 
gallstone; CBD is focally dilated to 9 mm.  There is no 
pericholecystic fluid.

The ED contacted the ERCP team, who recommended admission to the 
medical service for further care.

Now feels ok with only minimal left-sided abdominal pain; no 
radiation.  No current n/v.

History of Present Illness:
___ yo F with h/o obesity, with one day history of n/v and
abdominal pain. Pt had sushi for lunch on ___, then chicken &
noodles for dinner, with a single drink. She had gradual onset
of epigastric pain, accompanied by nausea and three episodes of
nonbloody emesis. She saw her PCP yesterday, who began
procholoperazine and prilosec for possible gastritis, which
provided only some relief. The PCP checked her amylase (3446)
and lipase (2816); the covering PCP referred the pt to the ED
for further evaluation, but she felt drowsy from the antiemetic,
so elected to wait until this am to present to the ED.
In the ED, lipase was 767. RUQ US revealed a thin gallbladder
filled with gallstones. There is shadowing in the CBD c/w
gallstone; CBD is focally dilated to 9 mm. There is no
pericholecystic fluid.
The ED contacted the ERCP team, who recommended admission to the
medical service for further care.
Now feels ok with only minimal left-sided abdominal pain; no
radiation. No current n/v.

gtt. He was given 6 L IVF found to be anuric with K 6.4, for 
which patient was started on dialysis ___. He underwent two 
sessions of iHD. Patient had TTE performed which demonstrated
large vegetation on anterior mitral valve leaflet measuring 
2.56cm in length with mild MR, bicuspid aortic valve with mild 
AS, preserved EF without WMA; RVSP 40. He was given vancomycin 
and cefepime. Preliminary blood cultures demonstrated MSSA 
bacteremia and patient was subsequently narrowed to cefazolin. 
He was given stress dose IV steroids. CTA chest/abdomen did not
demonstrate PE or septic emboli. Head CT did not show any acute
abnormality.

He was maintained on Vasopressin, Norepinephrine, Fentanyl, and 
___ transferred to ___ for TEE and surgical evaluation.

Imaging:
Head CT:
There is diffuse cerebral edema with loss of gray-white 
differentiation.  
There is effacement of the sulci. There is effacement of the 
lateral 
ventricles, basal cisterns and downward tonsillar herniation. 
There is 
increased density in the basilar cisterns likely related to 
diffuse cerebral edema. 
There is a possible fracture of the left medial orbital wall.  
There is 
opacification of the bilateral ethmoid air cells and mucosal 
thickening of the bilateral sphenoid sinuses and right maxillary 
sinus.  The frontal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. 
IMPRESSION: 
Diffuse cerebral edema with loss of gray-white differentiation 
and uncal and downward tonsillar herniation. 

CXR: 
Portable AP chest radiograph. The ETT now terminates 3.2 cm 
above the carina. Lung volumes are very low with low with 
bibasilar atelectasis.  
There is no pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with asystole -> PEA arrest with ROSC p/w cerebral edema and 
herniation.

#Cardiac Arrest/Brain Herniation: The patient was found down in 
the field and resusicated and had return of circulation after 39 
minutues from the time of EMS arrival on the scene. He was 
unresponsive and was placed on blood pressure support. His 
troponin was elevated, indicating a likely cardiac source for 
his arrest. He had a head CT that was notable for severe 
cerebral edema at the outside hospital. He was transfered to 
___ for further care. Here he required increased blood 
pressure support and was ultimatly on maximum dose of 3 
medications to raise blood pressure. He was unresponsive to 
painful stimuli. He was noted to have a left pupil that was 
fixed and dialated. He underwent repeat Head CT that was notable 
for severe cerebral edema with efacement of the grey/white 
matter and both tonsilar and uncal herniation. Neurosurgery was 
consulted who did not believe that any surgical or medical 
intervention would be successful in return of any type brain 
function. Given these findings multiple family meetings were had 
to explain the prognosis and that he would not improve. 
Following the family discussions the family decided to make the 
patient CMO and the pressors were stopped and he was extubated. 
The patient quickly passed and was pronounced dead at 2240. The 
family was informed and autopsy was declined.

improvement in his blood pressure. Per report from the ED all
lines and interventions were done without sedation. No family
member per the ED resident was with the patient. On repeat scan
in the ED he was noted to have uncle herniation and diffuse
swelling of the drain with lost of the grey white matter.

___ yr F w/ hx of ESRD on HD, HTN, DMII, and prior stroke in 
___ w/ residual mild aphasia who was transferred from OSH due 
to new onset R sided weakness and profound aphasia concerning 
for stroke. Exam is consistent with a L MCA syndrome w/ pt seen
to have severe expressive aphasia, L gaze preference, and R 
sided weakness. NIHSS at OSH was 22, tPA was given at OSH at 
___ on ___. NIHSS on ___ was 18. Etiology could potentially 
cardioembolic, given recurrent stroke and proximal vasculature
appearing clear on affected side. Her 24 hour head CT showed 
large L MCA
infarct, with no hemorrhage. Based on the CTA would not have 
expected the entire territory to infarct, as she had what 
appeared to be relatively good distal reconstitution. She has a 
fetal PCA on the L and appeared to be supplying her MCA from

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ woman with hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, dementia, ""slow"" leukemia, 
possible prolapsed uterus who was sent from nursing home with 
report of vaginal bleeding for two days because employees found 
blood on pad of her bed. The volume and source of the blood are 
both uncertain. In addition, the patient experienced some nausea 
and vomiting. The patient's mental status is poor at baseline, 
but she is usually more conversant and now more withdrawn.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 97.3F 70 82/44 14 96% RA.  She 
underwent gynecological evaluation. Gyn could not definitively 
rule out uterine prolapse, but who felt that patient more than 
likely had urethral prolapse. No vaginal bleeding (or any 
bleeding) on exam - can only tolerate one finger digital exam, 
but no blood on diaper or glove. Suspect bleeding was from 
irritation of urethral prolapse. Endometrial stripe 3mm on 
ultrasound (normal). No acute gyn issue.
.
Overall, no GYN intervention was needed, and given her 
leukocytosis and hypotension, admission to medicine was 
recommended. Labs were notable for floridly positive UA, Cr 1.7, 
WBC of 27K (1 band, 32% PMNs, rest Lymphs), HCT of 30, platelets

# Urinary tract infection: Patient's urinalysis positive for
bacteria, nitrites, and had > 200 WBCs. UTI leading to sepsis
may be responsible for hypotension on arrival to Emergency
Department, as well as altered mental status (although patient
may well be at baseline). Urine and blood cultures showed no
growth. Patient was afebrile durign hospitalization. High WBCs
complicated by patient's leukemia, though the patient did not

source of blood on patient's bed pads is unclear. ___ have been
secondary to urethral or uterus prolapse, though in either case,
Gynecology felt there was no need for intervention. ___ also be
rectal bleed, though stool guaiacs were negative. Patient may
also be losing blood via vomiting. Anemia further complicated by
patient's blood dyscrasia. Patient's hematocrit was stable. The
source of blood was likely uterine or urethral.
.
# Dementia: Continued donepezil therapy.
.
# Hypertension: Held home anti-hypertensives in setting of

RA.  Initial labs showed wnl chemistries, negative serum and 
urine tox screens, WBC 11.1, Hgb 15.0, Plt 199, troponins x 2 
were negative.  CXR showed RLL PNA. ECHO showed low normal LVEF 
of 50% but was otherwise unremarkable.  While in the ED, he 
developed substernal chest pain for which Cardiology was 
consulted.  His EKG showed TWI in the precordial leads and 
borderline LVH.  His chest pain was felt to be atypical and was 
reproducible on exam with palpation.  Inaptient admission for 
further monitoring on telemetry was recommended.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient denies any current chest 
pain and otherwise feels well.  He states feeling rather anxious 
and frustrated by the recent news from his dentist that he may 
have to have all of his lower dental teeth removed.  No other 
acute medical complaints.  He denies any fevers/cough/ns, but

Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history hypertension who 
presents with complaints of hypertension of SBP to 190 on home 
monitor.  
# Hypertension: Patient with history of hypertension dx one year 
ago, not adherent with medications due to cost. Although patient 
was prescribed Labetolol 200mg BID, Captopril 25mg BID and 
Nifedipine 60mg BID, he was not taking them except for when he 
felt sick. We did not restart his Acei due to bump in creatinine 
(unclear if chronic). At OSH ___ in ___) renal u/s was 
completed and negative for RAS. His BP on admission was 190/142 
and down trended to 140s-150/90s-110 the day of discharge. He 
felt a bit dizzy prior to admission and did not recur during 
admission. He was initially placed on labetolol 200mg BID, which 
was titrated up to 300mg BID and amlodipine 10mg daily. 
Hydralazine 10mg po TID was added with some effect and increased 
to 20mg TID. There was a large component of patient stressors 
(pending divorce/annulment of marriage) which may have been 
worsening patient's BP. On discharge, he was increased to 25 
Hydralazine TID and started on Atenolol 25 daily due to cost of 
medications (___ 4$). Patient vocalized that he would not be 
able to afford medications unless cheap, which is why the above 
regimen was chosen.  
-cont low sodium diet
-close f/u with new PCP, titrate up medications. 
-needs insurance, f/u with ___ clinic to get signed up.
-Consider starting ACEi if CR stable 

# ___ vs. CKD: Unknown baseline. Risk factors include 
hypertension. Creatinine was 1.4 on admission, increased to 1.6 
the night of admission and came back down to 1.4 on discharge. 
His UA was postive for protein at 30mg/dL (microalbuminemia).

presented with several days of low grade temperatures, 
headaches, shaking chills, and fatigue after a trip to ___ 
one month prior. 
.
#Febrile syndrome: Presentation seems most consistent with a 
viral syndrome.  Initial suspicion for meningitis in the ED and 
patient given ceftriaxone and vancomycin prior to arrival to the 
medical floor (pt refused LP).  Clinical suspicion for menigitis 
was very low by the time of the patient's admission to the 
floor, so antibiotics were discontinued.  Malaria was also 
entertained given prior traveling history and lack of 
prophylaxis, but smears were negative times four.  Pt did not 
receive any pretrip vaccinations.  Time line of presentation 
inconsistent with dengue.  Typhoid fever and yellow fever also 
thought to be less likely.  Full infection workup, including 
blood cultures, urine analysis, chest radiograph, liver function 
tests, and infectious labs - including viral hepatitis 
(A,C,D,E), EBv, toxo, CMV - were all negative.  With supportive 
care and fluid, the patient's fevers resolved and  symptoms 
significantly improved by hospital day three.  Patient was 
discharged home with PCP follow up.
.
#Tachycardia: On admission patient was tachycardic to the 120s 
which responded well to IV fluid boluses.  EKG consistent with 
sinus tachycardia.  Differential for tachycardia included fever, 
infectious process, anxiety, and hyperthyroidism.  TSH was sent 
which came back as 0.031 with T4 of 7.9 which suggested 
subcllinical hyperthyrodism for which patient will follow up 
with his PCP for further management.  On the day of discharge 
patient's heart rate had decreased to normal ranges of ___. 
.
Transition of care:
Pending Labs: Blood Cultures with no growth to date.
Patient will follow up with his PCP on ___ for evaluation 
of any remaining symptoms he may have as well as for management 
of his subclinical hyperthyrodism.

hours of chest pain earlier today. She initially presented to 
her PCP today for workup of a headache that has been going on 
for a month. Patient reports that while in the PCP's office, she 
developed substernal chest pressure, which is similar to the 
pain she gets with angina. At this point she was send to the ED. 


#Chest Pain
   HPI as above. While in the ED all laboratory testing was 
negative and EKG was equivocal. At this point given the patient 
history of preexisting cardiac disease and typical symptoms 
cardiology felt it would be best to admit over the weekend for 
observation for ACS and stress testing ___. Over the weekend 
Ms. ___ continued to have intermitted episodes of typical 
chest pain with negative testing. Cardiology originally wanted a 
pharmacologic stress test presantine MIBI but patient refused IV 
access and testing had to be converted to stress echo. As 
testing was limited to noting wall motion abnormalities only 
results should be taken in such context. Patient will likely 
need a discussion as an outpatient on need for more informative 
cardiac testing. 

#DM
  Patient refused sliding scale insulin and POC glucose checks. 
Maintained on outpatient PO medications

*****TRANSITION ISSUES*****
1. F/up with PCP. Potentially bring up negotiation for IV access 
and need for p-MIBI to truly investigate perfusion and vessels. 
2. Establish care with cardiology. 
3. No tests pending at time of d/c.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the GYN service for monitoring 
of her pain. She underwent serial abdominal exams for 
monitoring.  Ms. ___ had initially required narcotics for 
pain medication while in the ED but upon arriving to the floor 
had decreased need. Her work-up was unrevealing for a source of 
her abdominal pain with normal labs and imaging. Her abdominal 
exam was reassuring, without any distention or peritoneal signs 
throughout her entire hospitalization. She did however start her 
menses shortly after admission which was thought to contribute 
to her pain.  

On hospital day one she also had urinary retention and was 
straight catheterized for 600 cc of clear yellow urine. This was 
thought to be secondary to narcotic use. After that initial 
decompression she had no trouble voiding. 

By hospital day 2 she was able to control her pain with oral 
tylenol and motrin.  She no longer required narcotics.  She was 
ambulating, tolerating a regular diet and voiding spontaneously. 
 She was discharged home in good condition with follow-up.

predominance, elevated total protein and normal glucose findings 
are concerning for viral meningitis.  Likely ___ to recent viral 
URI symptoms which progressed.  Unclear that patient actually 
had meningitis years ago as he did no have a lumbar puncture at 
that time.  However, NSAID association with meningitis has been 
described and may be related to what is going on now.  Would 
also consider other potential viral causes including HIV 
encephalitis although mental status is normal. Patient was 
treated with acyclovir and IVF until HSV PCR from CSF returned 
negative at which point acyclovir was discontinued.  His pain 
was controlled with tylenol and oxycodone.  He was discharged 
home to follow-up with his primary care physician. 

# ___: likely ___ hypovolemia in patient with poor PO intake for 
the last ___ days c/b NSAID use.  Acyclovir was renally dosed 
until Creatinine improved with IVF.  His GFR was normal prior to 
discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with past history of idiopathic pancreatitis 
presents with abdominal pain and elevated lipase concerning for 
recurrent pancreatitis, now w/ normalized labs, negative CT and
EGD.

# ABDOMINAL PAIN / PANCREATITIS:
Lipase elevated to 431 on admission, now normalized. Initial 
presentation consistent with pancreatitis, though unclear why 
symptoms continue to persist at this point. Negative workup
including RUQ ultrasound, CT abd/pelvis, and EGD. There may be 
some component of patient/family anxiety that something worse is 
going on. Patient's father had friend who died of pancreatic
cancer after delayed diagnosis and this may be driving some of 
the anxiety. However, patient does seem to have very real 
symptoms which may not be entirely explained by pancreatitis. 
Normal EGD rules out PUD/gastritis. Patient's diet was advanced 
and she was tolerating full liquids at the time of discharge. 
Her symptoms were ultimately felt to be due to pancreatitis plus 
perhaps R lumbar muscle spasm. She will need to follow up with 
her outpatient gatroenterologist (Dr. ___ for consideration 
of further testing for idiopathic pancreatitis vs other 
functional GI causes that could explain her pain.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

pancreatitis, including genetic screening. This will likely be 
done by Dr. ___ patient's outpatient gastroenterologist.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ male who presented to the ED with 
___ days of gradual onset acute left lower back pain limiting 
his ability to walk. He has had left low back pain for about 1 
month. On ___ he awoke to pain down the side of his leg and 
anterior tenderness. This worsened over the subsequent 48 hours 
to the point where he could not stand or walk so he came to the 
ED. He denies fevers, urinary or fecal incontinence or 
retention, recent trauma, IV drug use or diabetes. He has no 
associated paresthesias or motor dysfunction.

In the ED, initial vitals: T 97.8, 96/67, 81, 16, 100%RA

PELVIS AND LEFT HIP (___):
Tiny bony fragment adjacent to the superior aspect of the left 
acetabulum is
likely an os acetabuli, a tiny avulsion fracture is considered 
much less
likely.

MRI LEFT HIP (___):
No fracture. Mild left greater trochanteric bursitis. 
Proliferative changes
the anterior aspect of the left femoral neck and subtle 
acetabular roof marrow
edema, suggestive of femoroacetabular impingement.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with no significant PMH admitted with acute to subacute 
onset left low back, and left lateral and anterior thigh pain. 

# Leg Pain: The patient was found to have an incidental finding 
on hip plain film of os acetabuli vs very small rectus femoris 
avulsion fracture. Patient denied history of trauma. He was 
admitted for pain control, requiring a combination of diazepam, 
oxycodone, tylenol, naproxen and gabapentin for adequate relief 
initially. MRI hip obtained for clarification of hip plain film 
findings revealed greater trochanteric bursitis but no evidence 
of either an occult femoral neck fracture nor rectus femoris 
avulsion fracture.. The night prior to discharge complained of 
numbness in L4 distribution. ___ saw him and thought his quads on 
the L were fatiguable. This ___ be consistent with an L4 
radiculopathy and he will follow up with spine. Patient's 
preference was for lumbar MRI. The patient was informed that the 
need for further imaging will be considered by his orthopedist 
at follow up if he has new/worsening or unresolved symptoms. At 
time of discharge his pain was well controlled on naproxen 
alone, although he was also discharged with a prescription for a 
small amount of oxycodone for breakthrough pain and valium for 
muscle spasm. He will be seen in ___ clinic at ___ on 
___. He will need ortho-spine followup within one 
week.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ on ___ with left leg pain. You 
were seen by Orthopedic Surgery during your admission and they 
thought your symptoms were likely caused by a problem with your 
spine (nerve impingement at L4). They did not think this 
required surgery right now and thought it will likely resolve on 
its own but you should follow up with a spine doctor within one 
week.   Your pain was managed with a combination of analgesics 
and you are now ready to be discharged home with close follow 
up. An MRI of your hip did not show a cause for your symptoms.  
If your symptoms worsen or if you have any new symptoms 
(worsened weakness) you should come to the ED.  Your outpatient 
orthopedics doctor who you will see ___ order an MRI of your 
spine when you see him if your symptoms are not resolving. 

It was a pleasure to take care of you during your hospital stay.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M with a history of EVAR (___), 
found to have an expanding AAA on follow up CT scans, no clear 
evidence of endoleak, admitted on ___ for aortogram with 
possible intervention (endoleak embolization vs limb extension 
vs graft relining). Intraop angiogram on ___ revealed no clear 
evidence of endoleak, but a large lumbar artery as visible. This 
lumbar artery was thought  to possibly be the source of an 
occult endoleak, and was embolized with coils. Final intraop 
angiogram revealed coiled lumbar artery and no evidence of 
endoleak. After the conclusion of the procedure but before 
extubation, Mr. ___ was noted to have ST elevations. A 12 
lead EKG and TEE were performed. By the time of both the EKG and 
the TEE, his ST changes had resolved (none were captured 
formally). His EKG showed no ST elevations, and TEE revealed no 
wall motion abnormalities. Mr. ___ remained intubated and 
was transferred to the ICU for monitoring overnight. Troponins 
were trended and were all negative. On post-op day 1, Mr. 
___ was extubated. He had a slight pressor requirement, and 
so he was monitored in the vascular immediate care unit for 24 
hours after being transferred from the ICU. He was weaned off 
pressors without complication. He continued to have ST changes 
by tele on POD#1,and so cardiology was consulted. The cardiology 
team reviewed his EKGs and thought his ST changes were 
non-specific and were not concerning for acute coronary syndrome 
in the setting of no troponin elevations and no chest pain. Mr. 
___ was kept in the hospital for monitoring until post-op 
day 2, when he was discharged with instructions to f/u with his 
cardiologist and Dr. ___. His groins were hemostatic, 
he lower extremities were warm and well perfused, and he denied 
abdominal pain at time of discharge.

he developed a troponin leak and acute renal insufficiency
which was thought to be prerenal and atrial fibrillation.  He
then was transferred at the request of the surgeon there with
an essentially an acute abdomen, respiratory at failure
requiring urgent intubation.  After initial stabilization and
resuscitation, and evaluation in the ICU, he was taken to the

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room on ___ for R 
femur periprosthetic hip ORIF (Distal femoral plate), which the 
patient tolerated well (for full details please see the 
separately dictated operative report). The patient was taken 
from the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after recovery 
from anesthesia was transferred to the floor.  The patient was 
initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, and 
progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. The 
patient was given perioperative antibiotics and anticoagulation 
per routine.  The patients home medications were continued 
throughout this hospitalization.  The patient worked with ___ who 
determined appropriate discharge. The ___ hospital course 
was otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable 
vital signs that were within normal limits, pain was well 
controlled with oral medications, incisions were 
clean/dry/intact, and the patient was voiding/moving bowels 
spontaneously. The patient is TDWB RLE in unlocked ___ 
brace, and will be discharged on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.  
The patient will follow up in two weeks per routine. A thorough 
discussion was had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and 
expected post-discharge course, and all questions were answered 
prior to discharge.

___ TTE
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal 
left ventricular wall thickness with a moderately 
increased/dilated cavity. Quantitative biplane left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 15 % (normal 54-73%). Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic 
sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal 
descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are 
mildly thickened. There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
moderate to severe [3+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve 
leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severely 
reduced left ventricular systolic function. No pericardial 
effusion. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Impella 
device is at appropriate depth.

___: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) was performed on a planned basis 
based on coronary angiographic findings documented on a prior 
angiogram. Postatherectomy the angiogram showed perforation of 
the ___ Diagonal bifurcation. Access was obtained in the 
left femoral artery and after multiple attempts Graftmaster - 
Covered stent 2.8mm was deployed at the site of perforation. The 
stent deployement resulted in closure of the perforation. The 
diagnoal outflow segment remained patent. For hemodynamic 
support Impella was inserted through the right femoral artery. 
The echocardiogram during the procedure showed absence of 
pericardial effusion. The wire was exchanged for Rota Floppy 
wire. Three passes were performed with the 1.5 mm burr at 170K 
RPM for <30 seconds each with no decelerations.
Complications: Complication: perforation
Findings: Successful PCI with drug-eluting stent of the LAD and 
diagonal coronary arteries. Impella device insertion for 
hemodynamic support.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with HTN, HLD and CAD 
who was admitted for planned staged PCI to the LAD. In ___ she was found to have severe CAD including 80% diag, 100% 
mid-LAD, 90% RCA. She declined CABG due to her preference to 
avoid invasive interventions. On ___ she had an 
uncomplicated intervention of the RCA. She presented on ___ 
for intervention to the LAD and LCx. Atherectomy of the LAD was 
complicated by coronary perforation that was treated with a 
covered stent and there was no evidence of effusion. She had an 
impella placed for hemodynamic support. 

Ms. ___ expressed that she did not want further interventions 
and wanted to revert to her DNR/DNI status. Her blood pressure 
was supported with norepinephrine as well as crystalloid and 
colloid infusions. Her impella settings were slowly weaned and 
this was removed on ___. Unfortunately she required 
increasing support after the impella was removed and dobutamine 
was added. Despite this, she continued to decline throughout the 
day. She then entered an unstable ventricular arrhythmia and 
passed away.

He normally takes 2 oral regimen for his type II diabetes. He 
recalls that one of his 2 agents is Actos, but does not know the 
name of the other agent. He reports excellent compliance with

he does it has been in the low 100s. The last time he checked 
his FSG at home was about 10 days ago. He denies fevers or 
chills. He reports that he has had a non-productive cough for 
about 7 months. This is following lobectomy for ""lung cancer."" 
He also notes right sided chest pain that is mostly pleuritic 
that has started following his lobectomy which was about 8 
months ago. He denies abdominal pain, nausea or vomitting. He 
had 1 episode of diarrhea 2 days ago.

minimal ketonuria. He was given 8 units of insulin with FSG to 
438. he was then given 4 units of insulin with resultant FSG at 
290 approximately 3 hours prior to arrival to medicine floor. He 
was given 3 L NS. He also reportedly had U waves on ECG. Normal 
lytes on arrival to ED, has not yet been repeated. He also had 
an RUQ ultrasound for reported RUQ pain (though appears to be

evaluation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ y.o. M with h/o lung resection, DM on oral 
medications only who presents with hyperglycemia to the 700s.
.
Hyperglycemia: Ddx included infection, poor compliance with 
medications, toxic metabolic disturbance, MI, among others.  He 
was placed on a sliding scale of insulin and in the first 12 
hours required >20 units of SC insulin.  Initial urinalysis was 
positive for ketones.  He did not have an anion gap despite his 
blood sugar of 701 on admission.  The hyperglycemia was 
attributed to recent steroid use and infectious workup was 
negative.  The patient endorsed knowing that his blood sugars 
were high and despite this he stopped checking them regularly at 
home.  He was initially going to be discharged on a temporary 
sliding scale, however the patient was unable to comprehend or 
interpret the sliding scale despite education by nursing with an 
interpreter.  His BS were expected to continue to improve off 
steroids and it was felt that the risks of inappropriate insulin 
dosing by the patient outweighed the benefits of tight control.  
He was discharged home on his usual regimen of glipizide and 
actos.  ___ will help continue diabetes teaching and the patient 
was instructed to check his sugars routinely and seek medical 
attention if they remain above 300. At the time of discharge his 
___ were in the low 200s.

FINDINGS: There is increased opacity near the right heart border 
within the area of the right middle lung, concerning for 
underlying infectious process. In addition, there is an 
approximately 17 x 12 mm ill-defined rounded opacity near the 
lateral portion of the left lung base which is not localized on 
the lateral view. Again noted is pleural thickening along the 
right apex. Again noted are several right lateral rib fractures 
and pleural thickening in this area, stable. There is elevation 
of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged. The cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is normal. Osseous structures appear intact. No free 
air is seen below the diaphragm. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Right middle lobe pneumonia. 
2. Ill-defined rounded hyperdensity in the left lower lung base, 
not seen on the lateral view. A chest CT could be done on a 
non-emergent basis for 
further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an unfortunate young man who was admitted for 
unresponsiveness that was likely feigned in the setting of being 
arrested for breaking and entering. He was admitted to the ICU 
in police custody for unresponsiveness. EEG was negative for 
seizure activity, CT and MRI were negative for acute pathology 
including stroke, hemorrhage, or evidence of trauma though MRI 
revealed possible foreign body in his sinus. 
He has a severe crack cocaine addiction and also abuses Etoh. He 
had no evidence of withdrawal during his admission. He was seen 
by our neurology service as well as psychiatric service. He 
endorses ""hearing voices"" but the pscychiatric service did not 
feel that he had pscychosis, likely again feigned in the setting 
of his arrest. Social work consulted for his substance abuse 
issues as well as his homelessness. 
Upon admission, his CK levels were elevated but trended down 
with diuresis. His cardiac enzymes were negative and EKGs were 
with out ischemic changes.
He should be further assessed by the court clinical 
psychiatrist.

Imaging:

CT Chest (___): No images sent. Per report: Right rib 
fractures
___, hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion, possible liver
hematoma. 

CT Abdomen (___): R chest tube with small residual 
pneumothorax, basilar
atelectasis, and subcutaneous emphysema. A small right chest 
wall
hematoma surrounds the chest tube. In addition, there is a very
small subcapsular liver hematoma extending from chest tube along 
the right lateral surface of liver. It is unclear if liver 
hematoma is due to initial trauma of tube insertion which is 
ultimately intra-pleural or if the course of the tube is 
partially intra-peritoneal,though the latter is felt less likely 
significantly distended bladder 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented as detailed above and was admitted to the 
Acute Care Surgery service for management of his rib fractures, 
hemothorax and subcapsular hematoma. The plan was to ensure good 
pain control to ensure good ventilation, follow chest tube 
output and perform serial abdominal exams for the subcapsular 
hematoma. The patient remained hemodynamically stable on the 
floor and his chest tube output was low so his chest tube, which 
was initially kept to wall suction, was switched to waterseal on 
HD2. Follow-up CXR demonstrated good lung volumes and no 
pneumothorax so his chest tube was removed. A post-pull CXR was 
obtained to rule out any residual pneumothorax. By end of HD2 
the patient was maintaining his oxygen saturations on room air 
after being weaned off oxygen and his pain was under control on 
PO pain medications so he was discharged home with a scheduled 
follow up visit in the ___ clinic in 2 weeks.

pulmonary contusion and small subcapsular liver hematoma.  

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
*  Your injury caused rib fractures on the right side of your 
rib cage which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you 
to take shallow breaths because of the pain.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay 
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep 
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the 
dose and notify your physician.

*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.

*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to 
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing 
and deep breathing.

*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.

*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.

*  Do NOT smoke

*  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs ( crepitus ).

* Continue to use your incentive spirometer 10 times an hour 
while awake.

* Check your incisions daily and report any increased redness or 
drainage.   Cover the area with a gauze pad if it is draining.

* Your chest tube dressing may be removed in 48 hours.  If it 
starts to drain, cover it with a clean dry dressing and change 
it  as needed to keep site clean and dry. 

* No driving while taking narcotic pain medication.

* Continue to stay well hydrated and eat well to heal your 
incisions

* Shower daily. Wash incision with mild soap & water, rinse, pat 
dry 

* No tub bathing, swimming or hot tubs until incision healed 

* No lotions or creams to incision site

* Walk ___ times a day and gradually increase your activity as 
you can tolerate.

Come to the ED if you experience any of the following:
-Fevers > 101 or chills 
-Increased shortness of breath, chest pain or any other symptoms 
that concern you.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was a ___ year old female with a past medical 
history significant for right frontal oligodendrocytoma s/p 
resection and colon cancer s/p resection who was admitted with 
temporal headache and eye pain.
.
# Headache, eye pain: The differential included temporal 
arteritis, trigeminal neuralgia, and Herpes ophthalmicus. 
Symptoms of headache, temporal tenderness, and jaw pain are 
consistent with GCA, although low-normal inflammatory markers 
made this less likely; although GCA with normal ESR/CRP has been 
reported. Herpes ophthalmicus was also a possibility, although 
symptoms would be very early as no skin lesions are noted and 
corneal involvement also not noted on exam by Ophthalmology. 
Trigeminal neuralgia is also a potential etiology, although the 
constant nature of the pain makes this less likely. The 
patient's history of a right frontal brain tumor raised the 
concern for relapse with compression of the trigeminal root. 
Rheumatology was consulted and recommended temporal artery 
biopsy to rule out GCA. An outpatient biopsy was arranged with 
vascular surgery and outpatient rheumatology follow up with 
close neuro-oncology and neuro-ophthalmology surveillance was 
strongly advised. She was started on prednisone 60 mg daily and 
was asked to continue this dose until outpatient follow up with 
rheumatology.

acrocyanosis one week prior to admission. Echo at outside 
hospital reported large atrial septal defect wtih primarily left 
to right shunt. There was moderate right ventricular dilatation, 
moderate right ventricular hypokinesis with moderate pulmonary 
hypertension. Echo also notable for a four centimeter clot in 
the right atrium. Prior to surgical intervention, she underwent 
cardiac catheterization which revealed normal coronary arteries. 
She was transferred to the ___ for cardiac surgical 
intervention.

Pertinent Results:
___ Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.A 
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at 
rest across a large secundum atrial septal defect. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately 
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The number 
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There 
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
___ Intraop TEE: PREBYPASS: A definite large (3.1cmx2cm) 
thrombus in the right atrial appendage. There is a bidirectional 
shunt across the interatrial septum at rest. A large secundum 
atrial septal defect is present. The left ventricular cavity 
size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is 
markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The 
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal 
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation 
is seen. POSTBYPASS: Pt was removed from cardiopulmonary bypass 
on epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions and was AV paced. 1. 
The large ASD has been subsequently repaired; there is no 
evidence of flow across the intraatrial septum. 2. The RV 
remains markedly dilated with moderate global hypokinesis. 3. LV 
remains with mild left ventricular hypokinesis without evidence 
of regional wall abnormalities. 4. Aortic contours are intact 
post decannulation.
___ CXR: The cardiomegaly is unchanged. The post-sternotomy 
wires are intact. Bibasilar consolidations consistent with 
atelectasis are grossly unchanged, still significant. There is 
no appreciable pleural effusion, and there is no pneumothorax.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
She was started on a heparin drips. She was started on cipro for 
a UTI. She was taken to the operating room on ___ where she 
underwent an atrial thrombectomy and ASD repair. She was 
transferred to the ICU in critical but stable condition on epi 
and propofol. She was given 48 hours of vancomycin as she was in 
the hospital preoperatively. She was extubated later that same 
day. She was started on fluconazole for the rash on her ankles. 
She was started on coumadin. She was transferred to the floor on 
POD #1.  Over the next several days the patient was gently 
diuresed, she was started on Bblockers and was anticoagulated. 
She has been in AFib with a rapid ventricular rate, up to the 
140's with activity.  By POD #7, after her Lopressor had been 
increased, her heart rate was better controlled. She was also 
started on Keflex for an IV site phlebitis. She is now stable, 
and ready to be discharged home.  Her Coumadin will be followed 
by the ___ (___), ___ has been 
notified, and records faxed to her there.

just an open wound. She denies any pain when the area is not 
being moved or manipulated but has pain when one pushes around 
the open area or when she moves the knee, which is new. Aside 
from these symptoms she has felt well.  

 
In the ED VS T 98.4, P 96, BP 125/70, RR 16, O2 100% on RA. Labs 
were unremarkable with no leukocytosis. Exam notable for open 
area with dark eschar and surrounding erythema. She received one 
dose of IV vanc for presumed cellulitis. Because of the area of 
dark tissue at the wound base the ED team felt uncomfortable 
obs'ing the patient and therefore she is being admitted to 
medicine. Of note, pt developed total body itching with vanco 
and some flushing and therefore received diphenhydramine 50 mg

History of Present Illness:
This is a healthy ___ year old female with history of severe hot
water burn of both knees in youth complicated by scarring who
presents for a wound evaluation three weeks after a disk
excision of an atypical nevus. The patient has been doing
relatively well after her surgery but noted some increased
swelling, discomfort, and redness around the site of her
excision starting three days prior to her ED presentation. On
the day prior to her ED presentation she was seen by her derm
surgeon who saw some surrounding erythema and a bit of yellow
fibrinous material at the wound base and recommended a course of
doxycycline for presumed cellulitis. The patient did not have
time to fill the prescription but then noted some dark tissue at
the base of the wound and increased redness today. She called in
and spoke to her dermatologist again and sent some pictures and
that provider recommended she come into the ED for evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with h/o mantle cell lymphoma s/p R-CHOP (minus 
adriamycin) and presumed alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy with EF 
50-55% on ___ presenting with lightheadedness and hypotension 
following stress test. 
 
# Lightheadedness/hypotension- Patient's symptoms began after 
fasting overnight and exercise, and were likely exacerbated by 
taking his home dose of metoprolol.  Hypotension did not occur 
during exercise, only during recovery phase so much less 
concerning for ACS.  Patient was ruled out overnight with 
negative cardiac enzymes.  In addition, he was chest pain free 
throughout admission and had no EKG changes.  Blood culture were 
negative to date, with low suspicion for infection as underlying 
cause of hypotension. He was fluid responsive at ___ 
clinic, and blood pressures remained stable throughout 
admission.  Orthostatics were negative at the time of discharge. 
 Lisinopril was held secondary to elevated creatinine, and 
metoprolol was decreased to 12.5mg succinate given hypotension.  

 
# Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy- Patient had depressed EF of 
___ during pre-chemotherapy work-up in ___.  This 
was attributed to long-term, excessive alcohol use.  Patient was 
started on lisinopril and metoprolol at that time, and has 
significantly cut down on his alcohol and tobacco intake.  His 
most recent echo in ___ showed an improved EF to 50-55%.  
Patient has no evidence of decompensation during admission with 
flat neck veins, no lower extremities edema and clear lungs. As 
above, home metoprolol was decreased and lisinopril was held 
given ARF.

# Acute renal failure- Creatinine elevated to 1.5.  Likely 
prerenal, supporting theory that hypotension was due to 
hypovolemia.  Creatinine trended down, and lisinopril was held 
at the time of discharge to be restarted by cardiologist in 
follow-up.

# Mantle cell lymphoma- s/p R-CHOP (without adriamycin given 
cardiomyopathy), now preparing for stem cell transplant. No 
active issues during admission. 

# Transitional issues-
- metoprolol succinate decreased to 12.5mg daily, lisinopril 
held on discharge
 
Medications on Admission:
Lisinopril 7.5 mgs daily
Metoprolol Succinate 25 mgs daily
Rosuvastatin 20 mgs daily

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
admission.

You were admitted with low blood pressure and lightheadedness.  
You received IV fluids and your pressure improved.  You had 
blood tests and EKGs which showed you were not having a heart 
attack.  Your symptoms and low blood pressure were likely 
related to fasting for you stress test and becoming dehydrated 
with exercise. 

You will be discharged home to complete your stress test 
imaging.

The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
- STOP lisinopril 
- DECREASE metoprolol to 12.5mg (split the pill in half!)
continue the remainder of your medications without changes

admission. Orthostatics were negative at the time of discharge. Lisinopril was held secondary to elevated creatinine, and
metoprolol was decreased to 12.5mg succinate given hypotension.
# Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy- Patient had depressed EF of
___ during pre-chemotherapy work-up in ___. This
was attributed to long-term, excessive alcohol use. Patient was
started on lisinopril and metoprolol at that time, and has
significantly cut down on his alcohol and tobacco intake. His
most recent echo in ___ showed an improved EF to 50-55%.
Patient has no evidence of decompensation during admission with
flat neck veins, no lower extremities edema and clear lungs. As
above, home metoprolol was decreased and lisinopril was held
given ARF.
# Acute renal failure- Creatinine elevated to 1.5. Likely
prerenal, supporting theory that hypotension was due to
hypovolemia. Creatinine trended down, and lisinopril was held
at the time of discharge to be restarted by cardiologist in
follow-up.
# Mantle cell lymphoma- s/p R-CHOP (without adriamycin given
cardiomyopathy), now preparing for stem cell transplant. No
active issues during admission.
# Transitional issues-
- metoprolol succinate decreased to 12.5mg daily, lisinopril
held on discharge

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On POD#2, patient was complaining of calf pain.  An ultrasound 
was performed, which showed a small fluid collection (likely a 
popiteal fossa hematoma), no clot noted.  No intervention 
needed.  She had an elevated heart rate throughout her 
hospitalization with increased activity.  Per patient report, 
this is not new.  She was instructed to follow-up with her 
primary care physician after discharge to have her TSH 
rechecked.  On day of discharge, her hematoma was 25.5.  She was 
started on iron supplementation and instructed to follow-up with 
her primary care physician ___ to have her labs 
checked and determine whether this medication needs to be 
continued.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled on oral and IV pain 
medications.  The patient received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis 
starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was removed on 
POD#2 and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. The 
surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision 
was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs 
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of an acute 
___ flare. In addition to the potential ___ flare, you 
were found to have inflammation of your pancreas (also known as 
pancreatitis) which we believe was most likely caused by 
starting 6-mercaptopurine. We treated you for the potential 
___ flare with antibiotics (including Cipro and Flagyl) and 
Solumedrol (methylprednisolone, which is a steroid like 
prednisone, which we used because it is available intravenously 
vs by mouth). For the acute pancreatitis, we kept you with 
nothing by mouth, gave you copious intravenous fluids, and gave 
you pain control medications. Your symptoms improved with 
treatment, and we were able to advance you to drinking and then 
a full diet.

We placed a PPD on your right forearm because you may be 
starting Remicade, a biologic agent for treatment of ___. 
This should be read on ___. Please have this read at Dr. 
___ or return to the ___ ___ floor 
and ask for any member of the ___ to have it read.

Please do not resume your home 6-mercaptopurine, as we suspect 
this may have precipitated your acute pancreatitis. Please 
continue prednisone 40 mg daily until evaluated by Dr. 
___ dose changes may be made at that time. You will 
continue antiobiotics (flagyl and ciprofloxacin) for four more 
days as well. You may resume your home omeprazole.

Please follow-up with your outpatient gastroenterologist Dr. 
___ tomorrow as scheduled.

Please return to the ___ ED or call your physician if you 
experience worsening or returning pain, nausea, vomiting, 
fevers, chills, worsening diarrhea, back pain, dizziness, 
light-headedness, blood in the stool, or any other medical 
emergency.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of an acute
___ flare. In addition to the potential ___ flare, you
were found to have inflammation of your pancreas (also known as
pancreatitis) which we believe was most likely caused by
starting 6-mercaptopurine. We treated you for the potential
___ flare with antibiotics (including Cipro and Flagyl) and
Solumedrol (methylprednisolone, which is a steroid like
prednisone, which we used because it is available intravenously
vs by mouth). For the acute pancreatitis, we kept you with
nothing by mouth, gave you copious intravenous fluids, and gave
you pain control medications. Your symptoms improved with
treatment, and we were able to advance you to drinking and then
a full diet.
We placed a PPD on your right forearm because you may be
starting Remicade, a biologic agent for treatment of ___.
This should be read on ___. Please have this read at Dr.
___ or return to the ___ ___ floor
and ask for any member of the ___ to have it read.
Please do not resume your home 6-mercaptopurine, as we suspect
this may have precipitated your acute pancreatitis. Please
continue prednisone 40 mg daily until evaluated by Dr.
___ dose changes may be made at that time. You will
continue antiobiotics (flagyl and ciprofloxacin) for four more
days as well. You may resume your home omeprazole.
Please follow-up with your outpatient gastroenterologist Dr.
___ tomorrow as scheduled.
Please return to the ___ ED or call your physician if you
experience worsening or returning pain, nausea, vomiting,
fevers, chills, worsening diarrhea, back pain, dizziness,
light-headedness, blood in the stool, or any other medical
emergency.

Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC
#Depression/Anxiety: Patient's distress appears to be due to 
combination of depressive and anxious symptoms.  She has had 
trouble adjusting to being at a larger school and felt betrayed 
and abandoned by the friends she has made. Her feelings of 
isolation led to suicidal thoughts. Upon admission to the unit 
patient was already starting to feel better as these issues were 
being addressed and she had communicated her distress to her 
boyfriend and parents which improved feeling of isolation. Her 
wellbutrin was discontinued as she did not feel like it was 
helping her and she was started on Zoloft 50mg which she 
tolerated well. Due to her current lack of insurance, she will 
be given a month supply of Zoloft on discharge and will f/u with 
___ student counseling until her insurance starts and she 
can see a private therapist and psychiatrist.

Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC
#Depression/Anxiety: Patient's distress appears to be due to
combination of depressive and anxious symptoms. She has had
trouble adjusting to being at a larger school and felt betrayed
and abandoned by the friends she has made. Her feelings of
isolation led to suicidal thoughts. Upon admission to the unit
patient was already starting to feel better as these issues were
being addressed and she had communicated her distress to her
boyfriend and parents which improved feeling of isolation. Her
wellbutrin was discontinued as she did not feel like it was
helping her and she was started on Zoloft 50mg which she
tolerated well. Due to her current lack of insurance, she will
be given a month supply of Zoloft on discharge and will f/u with

This is a ___ malip that presented to triage for
induction of labor for elevated blood pressures in the
150s/100s.  She presented earlier in
pregnancy with diagnosis of preeclampsia, admitted to the
hospital and then was discharged and followed outpatient for
preeclampsia.  Due to worsening blood pressure in the office,
at 37 weeks, a decision was made to admit this patient for
induction of labor.  The patient was admitted, started with
Cytotec for induction of labor.  Blood pressure remained
elevated.  Labetalol IV was used to maintain her blood
pressure.  Magnesium bolus was started too after admission.
After Cytotec was used, Pitocin was initiated.  The patient's
exam had been unchanged.  Low dose Pitocin was started.  The
patient went up to 20 of Pitocin.  The cervix remained
closed, continued to use IV labetalol as needed to control
blood pressures, maintain the patient on magnesium.  We
continued induction.  We restarted Cytotec again.  Pitocin
for the ___ time had been restarted.  On going up on Pitocin
the fetal heart rate had been in a category 1, but the
patient had started to have late decelerations and decision
was made with the patient to turn off the Pitocin, proceed
with C section for minimal change on her exams.

The patient delivered, on ___, in the morning after
decision was made to go with a C section after failed
induction in the setting of severe preeclampsia with a
nonreassuring fetal heart tracing.  The patient agreed.  The
patient did well postoperatively on the floor.  We continued
labetalol orally at 200 mg b.i.d.  During the ___
hospital course, the patient was given nifedipine, because
the labetalol, patient was responding well to, her blood
pressures were still elevated.  Then the patient was switched
over to 30 mg of the extended release nifedipine which she
tolerated well.  The patient was discharged home on the
nifedipine to follow up in the office within 1 week for
another blood pressure check with monitoring for her
medication.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ underwent uncomplicated resection of biliary 
cystadenoma (segment 7) with intra-op placement of JP drain. On 
POD 1, her pain was not controlled by mixed epidural, it was 
d/c'ed and she was placed on Dilaudid PCA and given tordol 30mg 
IV q6 x3 days with better pain control. She was nauseous and 
given chompazine. Her foley was also d/c'ed and she voided 
spontaneously. She was noted to have SBP to ___ and was given 
500cc NS bolus to good effect. On POD 2, she complained of 
migraine; she was evaluated by anesthesia who were confident her 
migraine was unrelated to epidural and she was started on 
fiorcet. She underwent CXR for dyspnea and was noted to have 
moderate layering right and small layering left pleural effusion 
with likely compressive atelectasis; she was encouraged to use 
IS. On POD 3, she was switched to PO pain medication, tolerating 
regular diet, and had flatus. Her JP drain was removed. On POD

Mucinous carcinoma, arising in a background of borderline 
mucinous tumor, intestinal type. See note
and synoptic report.
Note: Areas of destructive pattern invasion are present (for 
example, block ___, where it measures
1.6 cm in expanse on a single slide), as well as areas of 
cribriform growth and other areas with
prominent intraluminal papillary growth.
2. Omentum, biopsy:
- Benign fibroadipose tissue with acute and chronic 
inflammation, reactive mesothelial changes, and
focal decidualization.
- No malignancy identified.
3. ___ placenta, 296 grams (approximately ___ percentile 
for gestational age of ___ weeks 3
days):
- Placenta with multifocal infarct, involving approximately 10% 
of the placental body, and chorionic
villi with accelerated maturity, consistent with maternal 
vascular malperfusion.
- Unremarkable three-vessel umbilical cord and fetal membranes.
- No malignancy identified.

DIAGNOSIS:
PELVIC WASHING:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Unremarkable and reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, 
histiocytes and red blood cells
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ G1 P0 who was transferred from an 
outside hospital with severe IUGR, oligohydramnios, newly 
diagnosed severe gestational hypertension.  She was started on 
magnesium.  She developed recurrent late decelerations.  
Decision was made to proceed
with cesarean section.  Decision was made to proceed through a 
vertical skin incision due to a large 24 cm ovarian mass, with 
plan to remove the mass at time of cesarean section. She thus 
underwent an urgent primary low transverse, right 
salpingo-oophorectomy, washings, omental bx via midline vertical 
incision for decreased FM and 24cm pelvic mass on ___ with 
both maternal fetal medicine and gynecologic oncology present. 
She was also with Crohn's disease and severe gestational 
hypertension. 

She completed 24 hours of IV magnesium infusion postpartum, and 
was initiated on nifedipine 30mg daily on ___ for elevated 
blood pressure readings. Her serum pregnancy-induced 
hypertension labs were notable for elevated uric acid of 6.2, 
but were otherwise within normal limits. For her Crohn's 
disease, she was maintained on Zantac daily, and Zofran as 
needed.

Final pathology of the pelvic mass was found to be mucinous 
carcinoma in background of borderline, with planned presentation 
at gynecologic oncology tumor board for further treatment 
planning and follow-up scheduled. 

Her pain was treated with oral pain medications. She ambulated 
and her foley was discontinued and she voided spontaneously. Her 
diet was advanced without incident. 

By postpartum day 5, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was 
then discharged home in stable condition with postpartum 
outpatient follow-up scheduled.

ACTIVE ISSUES
Colonic obstruction: The pt was found to have a sigmoid volvulus 
on CT.  The pt was transfered to ___ for further evaluation, and 
the pt was offered operative treatment.  The pt did not want a 
surgery, but agreed to attempt to have colonoscopic 
decompression.  The pt underwent a decompression on the first 
day he was here, but he failed to pass flatus and stools the 
next day.  In the setting of a rising WBC, patient was started 
empirically on vanco/ceftriaxone.  A repeat KUB showed that he 
had a recurrent volulus, and the pt was decompressed again.  
Again, he failed to improve and didn't pass stool or flatus the 
next day, and again a repeat KUB showed that he had another 
sigmoid volvulus.  The pt continued to decline surgery for fear 
of a colostomy.  After family meeting with primary and 
palliative care teams, the decision was given to advance to 
comfort care, as patient wished to stay comfortable with no 
aggressive intervention.  Pt developed abdominal pain on HD3, 
and responded well to morhpine.

Mr. ___,

___ was a pleasure to take care of you while you were here in the 
hospital.  As we discussed, part of your intestines is twisted 
upon itself, and despite trying to untwist twice with the 
colonoscope, it continues to remain twisted.  The area of your 
intestine that's twisted is called the sigmoid colon, and the 
medical word for ""twisted"" is ""volvulus"", so your diagnosis is a 
sigmoid volvulus.  

After considerable discussion about your options and what would 
be in your best interest, you arrived at the conclusion that the 
best thing for you would not be a surgery, and rather to focus 
on comfort care and control your pain.  We agreed with this, and 
arranged for you to go to a hospice home where they will 
continue to treat your pain and make you comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was started on the eating protocol the day of 
admission.  On HD #1 she was started on solid foods and vomited 
after eating which was not believed to be induced.  She was then 
started on ensure supplements which she tolerated throughout HD 
#2.  She was started once again on solids on HD #3 and vomited 
once again, which was again not believed to be induced. The 
patient expressed concern that limited food options were 
available to her because she was vegetarian.  It was also 
thought that anxiety was playing a large role in her inability 
to tolerate solid foods.  She reported severe anxiety at the 
thought of eating foods which she felt was causing her vomiting. 
She was therefore started on zyprexa and ativan.  She was also 
taken off of the eating protocol because after three days she 
had not tolerated any solid food intake, and the medical staff 
felt that if she had more choice that maybe she would be less 
likely to vomit.  On HD #4 and #5 she remained off of the eating 
protocol but was also reporting significantly more anxiety and 
she was therefore able only to tolerate popsicles and juice.  
Her ativan and zyprexa were switched to be given prior to meals 
with mild impact on her anxiety.  On HD#6 her ativan dosing was 
increased, however the patient still reported being too anxious 
to tolerate any oral intake.  

The day of admission the patient's potassium was 3.4 and she

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was started on the eating protocol the day of
admission. On HD #1 she was started on solid foods and vomited
after eating which was not believed to be induced. She was then
started on ensure supplements which she tolerated throughout HD
#2. She was started once again on solids on HD #3 and vomited
once again, which was again not believed to be induced. The
patient expressed concern that limited food options were
available to her because she was vegetarian. It was also
thought that anxiety was playing a large role in her inability
to tolerate solid foods. She reported severe anxiety at the
thought of eating foods which she felt was causing her vomiting.
She was therefore started on zyprexa and ativan. She was also
taken off of the eating protocol because after three days she
had not tolerated any solid food intake, and the medical staff
felt that if she had more choice that maybe she would be less
likely to vomit. On HD #4 and #5 she remained off of the eating
protocol but was also reporting significantly more anxiety and
she was therefore able only to tolerate popsicles and juice.
Her ativan and zyprexa were switched to be given prior to meals
with mild impact on her anxiety. On HD#6 her ativan dosing was
increased, however the patient still reported being too anxious
to tolerate any oral intake.

received 40meq of potassium. Her Potassium remained normal for
4 days. On ___ her potassium was 3.2 and she was given 60meq
of potassium. On ___ her potassium was 4.2. her calcium and
magnesium remained normal throughout her hospitalization. Her
phosphate was mildly elevated.

Discharge Instructions:
Your diet will be advanced from clear liquids to solids as you 
recover from your surgery.  Every patient is recovers 
differently and will tolerate diet advancement based on that.  
Foods that are soft in texture makes swallowing easier as the 
operative swelling of the esophagus decreases.  These 
suggestions will help you as you recover.  Remember that your 
stomach was also used as part of the fundoplication wrap so you 
will be eating much less than prior to surgery and will fill 
much more quickly.  It is suggested that you eat smaller, more 
frequent meals including snacks.  Limit drinking large amounts 
of liquids at meal time to avoid filling quickly.  Also avoid 
drinking liquids through a straw as this may cause you to 
swallow air leading to gas in your abdomen and bloating.  Avoid 
chewing gum, tobacco and carbonated beverages as these items can 
cause the same problem.

You will be discharged on clear liquids and very soft moist 
foods such as eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, soups, chowders, 
puddings, Jell-O, ice cream, sherbet, etc.  Sweet foods may 
digest faster than others so eat sweets at the end of your meal. 
 If you are having no hold-up or the feeling of food sticking, 
you may advance your diet to canned fruits and vegetables, 
whipped white and sweet potatoes, squash, etc.  If you have 
continued success, you may now implement things like flaky fish, 
chicken and ___ steak.  If you continue to have no issues, 
you may then advance your diet to foods like fresh fruits and 
vegetables, side dishes of pasta and rice and salads such as 
tuna, chicken, pasta and potato.   

A high percentage of patients are able to advance their diet so 
that when they return for their 2 week postoperative check-up, 
they are digesting everything except  bread / cake like products 
including crackers, chips, pizza crust, tortilla chips etc.  
Foods that have a sharp consistency are prohibited for at least 
4 to 6 weeks to avoid puncturing the wrap. You should also avoid 
items like popcorn, nuts and meats with a lot of gristle.

The postoperative adjustment period is approximately 4 to 6 
weeks so do not feel discouraged if you cannot advance your diet 
as quickly as youd like.  It is a trial and error type effort.  
If initially you try something and you have some issues, wait 
and try again in several days.  The wrap initially is very tight 
and will loosen over time.  Every patients body reacts to 
surgery differently and the esophagus could be still swollen 
enough so that you cannot advance your diet to your liking.  
Some patients are seen for their first postoperative visit and 
are still on very soft solids.  You should not be alarmed by 
this and Dr. ___ will further discuss this with you at the 
time of your postoperative visit.  

Also, some patients have the feeling of having a stiff neck, 
shoulder discomfort or some chest pressure.  This could be the 
result of the laparoscopic surgery when air is used as part of 
the procedure and, oftentimes, gets trapped into the diaphragm.  
If the pain does not warrant narcotic use but is still annoying 
you can try taking ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours.  Use this 
medication only if you can take aspirin based medication and you 
do not get stomach upset or have issues with bleeding.  This 
does, however, take a week or so to resolve.

___ y/o woman with no prior
psychiatric admissions but a prior diagnosis of ""mood disorder""
presents via ambulance with a BAL of 166. Two days prior, the
patient states her boyfriend broke up with her and she was
extremely upset, as she states she is ""in love with him"". Last
night, despite the break up, they had plans to celebrate their
one year anniversary together and he stood her up. She was very
upset over this and in an attempt to calm down and sleep, took 4
extra 1mg Xanax tablets. Later on, she decided to go out with 
her
friends and she became intoxicated. When she arrived home, she
coincidently ran into her ex-BF (they live in the same 
building),
and the patient became argumentative. She admits to questioning
him repeatedly, yelling at him, and pulling his hair and 
punching
him. As she gives this history she is sobbing. She states she 
was
so angry with him, but says ""I wish I didn't do this, now he
won't take me back"". She then took a knife from his kitchen and
states she held it to her body. She decided to call her mother
during this time, and although does not remember stating that 
she
was suicidal, believes she could have. Her mother encouraged her
boyfriend to call ___ and she was brought to ___.

The patient states she just spoke to her BF because she needed 
to
know whether they are going to be together. She states ""I'm 
going
to go insane without him"". She says it is going to be very
difficult to go back to the apartment complex where they both
live and he also attend the same school as she does, which she
finds unbearable to think about. She admits to being very
dependent on him and not wanting to be alone.

In ___, patient had a miscarriage and required surgery (8
weeks gestation). Patient was unsure whether she was going to
have the child. Patient seems unsure of whether this event has
affected her.

The patient denies current SI and states that she is afraid of
dying. She denies ever having SI in the past and has no prior
suicide attempts. She states her mother has tried to kill 
herself
a dozen times and believes her behaviour last night was to gain
attention. When asked about depression, the patient admits to
being depressed ""always"". She has very poor sleep and states she
is extremely moody, especially in the mornings. She sees a
someone for her moods and is currently on Lamcital, as well as
Xanax.

Spoke to her family. Mother and father both have concerns for
their daughter as she is functioning very poorly and is highly
dependent on her boyfriend. Mother says that her daughter told
her earlier in the ED that she would continue to have suicidal
thoughts if she does not get back together with her boyfriend.
However, they deny that she has ever been suicidal before. They
suggest that this is the ___ breakup, but even when she is not
broken up with her BF, she is depressed and recently during a

poorly in school. Of note, she sees an NP for her psych meds ___

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.  
Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed early  or  partial  small 
bowel  obstruction  with transition  point  in  the  left  lower 

quadrant.  The patient was hemodynamically stable and was having 
flatus in the Emergency Dept. The patient was admitted for 
non-operative management of her bowel obstruction. She was kept 
on bowel rest with IV fluid resuscitation, nasogastric tube for 
stomach decompression, and serial abdominal exams. 
.
Pain was resolved. On HD2 the patient was endorsing bowel 
function so the nasogastric tube was discontinued. Diet was 
progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good 
tolerability. The patient voided without problem. During this 
hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently, was 
adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and 
actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and denies 
abdominal pain. She was having bowel movements.  The patient was 
discharged home without services. The patient received discharge

debridement down to bone with debridement of necrotic tissue; 
proximal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis with autograft; 
reverse fascial cross-finger flap from the ring finger measuring 
3 x 3 cm; and split- thickness skin graft from the hypothenar 
eminence. She tolerated the procedure well; please see the 
separately dictated operative report for complete details. The 
decision to admit post operatively was made in order to allow 
her intra-operative cultures to speciate and check sensitivities 
while remaining on empiric IV antibiotic therapy as an inpatient 
and consult infectious diseases for assistance with her 
antibiotic management. This decision resulted from her having 
failed outpatient therapy with oral 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

and was subsequently admitted to the orthopaedic hand surgery 
service. She was maintained on vancomycin empirically. Her pain 
was controlled on oral pain medications, and she was 
independently ambulatory. Her right hand was maintained in a 
splint. 

Her intra-operative cultures grew methicillin sensitive 
coagulase negative staphylococcus species, sensitive to 
vancomycin and daptomycin. Infectious diseases was consulted and 
recommended transitioning to daptomycin on hospital discharge 
for once daily dosing as opposed to what would have been q8h 
dosing of vancomycin. A ___ line was placed on ___. 
She was discharged home on ___ ___ with ___ services for 
IV daptomycin infusion and weekly surveillance laboratory 
monitoring. At the time of hospital discharge, pain was 
controlled on oral pain medications; she was voiding

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after a crush injury. You were found 
to have 4 left sided rib fractures. Your vital signs and lab 
work is stable. You pain is moderately controlled on oral pain 
medicine. You are medically cleared to be discharged home to 
continue your recovery. Please note the following discharge 
instructions: 

* Your injury caused 4 rib fractures which can cause severe pain 
and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of 
the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

2)Id workup
ID consulted for evaluation of cervical lymphadenopathy prior to 
infliximab initation. PPD placed and was negative in house. CXR 
negative.

ID impression:  ""Low suspicion of latent TB infection given 
evidence at hand. 
PPD may be falsely negative in setting of immune suppression and 
may
gain some more information from Quantiferon Gold, though also
could be falsely negative. Would evaluate for exposure to other
infections that could be important with immune suppression.""

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-check Quantiferon Gold before initiating therapy unless
infliximab administration is urgent, in which case risk/benefit
would favor starting infliximab
-if either ppd or Quantiferon Gold is positive, would contact us
to assist with likely treatment for latent TB infection
-check serologies to toxoplasma, CMV, and strongyloides
-check HIV Ab

3) Right ureteral obstruction on CT scan?  ___ be from adjoining 
ileitis.  Does appear to have some symptoms at the end of 
urination, reports of pelvic spasm sensation, though no signs of 
infection on U/A

EGD ___
Esophagus:  
 Contents: A rhomboid appearing object with the appearance of a 
hard shell was encountered in the cervical esophagus. Upon 
intubation of the esophagus, the object spontaneously passed 
lower into the esophagus and then lodged into the GE junction. A 
___ was used to grasp the object, and then subsequently the 
object and the endoscope were removed. Upon inspection, it 
appeared that the object had the appearance of a lobster shell.  
 
 Mucosa: After removal of the foreign body, a repeat endoscopy 
was performed. There was evidence of mild inflammation,linear 
erosions, and mild ulceration proximal to the GE junction. There 
were also diffuse linear erosions throughout the mid-esophagus 
likely secondary to trauma from the removal of the foreign 
object. The erosions were most noted at approximately 28 cm.   
Stomach:  
 Contents: A significant amount of semi-solid food was noted in 
the stomach.   
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the antrum.   
Duodenum:  
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.  
Impression: Hard shelled object noted in the esophagus that was 
successfully removed via ___ (foreign body removal)
Areas of erythema, mild ulceration, and linear erosions worst at 
28cm likely secondary to trauma from removal of the foreign 
body.
Retained fluids in stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
Recommendations: Would recommend checking Neck and Chest X-rays 
post procedure to detect if there is any remnant foreign body 
lodged in the esophagus. If patient remains symptomatic, please 
consider obtaining CT chest to look for evidence of perforation. 

Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire 
procedure. The patient's home medication list is appended to 
this report. FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression 
section above. Estimated blood loss = <5ccs. Foreign body sent 
for pathological analysis. 

___ PRE-EGD CSPINE 
FINDINGS:  Mild prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  Again seen 
is a linear hyperdensity within esophagus at approximately C6 
and C7 levels.  Unchanged vertebral bodies and mild degenerative 
changes.  See operative report for further details.

___ POST-EGD CSPINE 
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube is present.  No definite linear 
radiodense foci are seen within the esophagus.  Unchanged 
degenerative changes.  IMPRESSION:  No definite remaining 
foreign body.  If further evaluation is needed, recommend CT.

___ CXR:
Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  There 
is questionable opacity above the right hilus, unclear if 
represents pulmonary nodule or summation of shadows.  
Correlation with upright PA and lateral radiographs is 
recommended when possible.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural 
effusion.

___ FOREIGN BODY PATHOLOGY PENDING

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with no significant PMH presented with foreign body 
lodged in the esophagus.

Active Issues:
# Esophageal foreign body -  She initially presented to OSH with 
stable vital signs.  CT showed no evidence of esophageal 
perforation.  On arrival to BI MICU, she was intubated for 
airway protection and underwent emergent EGD by GI w/ thoracic 
surgery present. The foreign body (crab or lobster shell) was 
successfully removed  and sent to pathology for identification. 
Given the proximity of the sharp-appearing foreign body to 
common carotid artery, she was observed for an extended period 
and remained stable.  Uneventful extubation.  Repeat c-spine x 
rays did not show further foreign body remnants or pneumothorax. 
 She did not require repeat EGD.  She was advanced to regular 
diet and was treated with Maalox and Carafate for symptomatic 
esophageal discomfort.

Chronic Issues:
none

Transitional Issues:
# Will need repeat CXR as outpatient because CXR read in house 
showed ""questionable opacity above the right hilus, unclear if

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ was admitted to the thoracic surgery service 
following her right upper lobectomy and right atrial repair. For 
detailed description of her procedure please see the 
corresponding operative note. She was recovered in the PACU and 
later transferred to the floor without issue. She was seen by 
the acute pain service who placed a right ESP catheter which 
worked well to control her pain initially . Over the following 
day her pain control was less adequate so a dilaudid PCA was 
added with good response. Her chest tube was also placed to 
water seal, but after an increasing pneumothorax was noted, it 
was placed to suction. On POD 3 her chest tube was again placed 
to water seal. A pneumothorax was noted, but she was otherwise 
clinically stable so she remained on water seal. The chest tube 
remained with minimal output. On POD 5 she was transitioned to 
oral analgesia without issue. On POD 6 it was decided that her 
chest tube could be removed. A stitch was placed at the chest 
tube site due to some leakage of fluid. Post-pull chest xray 
showed a slightly increased pneumothorax. Because of this, we 
obtained a repeat chest xray two hours later that showed a 
stable size of the small pneumothorax. At this point she was 
deemed to be fit for discharge with no active issues. She will 
follow up in thoracic clinic in the coming weeks and have her 
stitch removed.

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL LEFT  ___ 6:18 ___.
FINDINGS: The bones are diffusely demineralized which reduces 
the sensitivity for detecting subtle non-displaced fracture. 
There is a tiny osseous fragment at the base of the fifth 
metatarsal. Given the morphology and size I doubt this is of 
clinical significance. Otherwise, no definite fracture or 
dislocation is identified. Alignment is anatomic. There is mild 
soft tissue swelling over the dorsum of the foot. Extensive 
vascular calcification is noted.
IMPRESSION: No definite traumatic injury of the foot identified. 
Please note the study is limited secondary to inherent baseline 
severe osteopenia

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Foot Pain/Probable fifth metatarsal fracture
- Points to pain on lateral side of left foot.   
- Tylenol ___ every six hours around the clock although she 
sometimes refuses this related to delirium/dementia.
- Ordered for lidocaine patch to start today for more constant 
pain relief in addition to the Tylenol.
- podiatry recomended conservative managment, weight bearing as 
tolerated. 
.
2. Dementia/Depression/Delrium 
- Dementia diagnosed in past six months
- Delirium related to Ativan, change in environment ( to 
assisted living and then hospitalization).  No infectious cause 
found.  TSH normal.  RPR non-reactive.  Family does not want 
brain imaging at this time.  B12 low, received one dose IM then 
oral replacement therapy was started.
- Psych and Geriatric teams consulted to assist with delirium 
workup, possible pain, and assistance with medication 
management.
- She was given Ativan TID three weeks prior to admission, this 
seemed to exacerbate her behavior.  It was tapered off in the 
hospital last dose ___ am.  She was getting Haldol BID while 
in the hospital with little effect.  With consultation with 
geriatrics and psych her regimen was changed to start Seroquel 
12.5mg BID PRN agitation to start tonight, along with trazodone 
25mg QHS.  She did receive one dose of this ___ night which 
helped her sleep and she was calm and oriented the morning 
after.
- Very hard of hearing.  Debrox ear drops used for 4 days this 
hospitalization for cerumen impaction, last dose ___.

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL LEFT ___ 6:18 ___.
FINDINGS: The bones are diffusely demineralized which reduces
the sensitivity for detecting subtle non-displaced fracture.
There is a tiny osseous fragment at the base of the fifth
metatarsal. Given the morphology and size I doubt this is of
clinical significance. Otherwise, no definite fracture or
dislocation is identified. Alignment is anatomic. There is mild
soft tissue swelling over the dorsum of the foot. Extensive
vascular calcification is noted.
IMPRESSION: No definite traumatic injury of the foot identified.
Please note the study is limited secondary to inherent baseline
severe osteopenia

dyspnea that progressed to rest dyspnea. No hemoptysis, ___ 
swelling, no fevers, chills. (+) cough, productive of white 
sputum. 

Initial vitals in the ED were:  100.1 123 127/61 24 77% RA. He 
then was satting in ___ on 15L NRB. On arrival there was initial 
concern for PE, so received 1 dose lovenox on way to stat CTA, 
which was negative for PE, but did show some lingular GGO. He 
was placed on bipap due to increased work of breathing, but had 
oxygen sats in the ___ and was therefore intubated w/ etomidate 
and succinylcholine. Immediately after paralysis and sedation, 
spO2 increased to ___, then declined to ___. He was bagged and 
came back to ___. PEEP was increased to 15, and he received 80 
iv Lasix, vanc/cefepime. R femoral arterial and central venous 
lines were placed.

On arrival to the MICU, he was hypoxic to the ___. Paralysis had 
worn off, so he was paralyzed again and started on Flolan. He 
then acutely desatted to ___ and became hypotensive to SBP 
___ requiring dopamine and levophed. Flolan was stopped. He was 
given Lasix 80 mg IV. Beside ECHO was performed by cardiology 
that showed no intracardiac shunt, markedly dilated RV, trivial 
pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology. Leg raise 
showed that he was fluid responsive so he was given 1L NS. He 
was switched to dobutamine, levophed, and briefly on 
neosynephrine. Oxygenation improved.

He then acutely desaturated to ___ in the absence of any 
provocation. Multiple adjustments to the vent were made without 
effect. He was retrialed on Flolan with further desaturation. He 
subsequently had a PEA arrest. He received one round of chest 
compressions with epix1 and bicarb with ROSC.

After the arrest, he was given Lasix 120 mg IV. PA catheter was 
placed. He then had a second PEA arrest with a round of chest 
compressions, epix1, bicarb with ROSC. He was started on 
epinephrine gtt. PA catheter numbers revealed PA pressures of 
88/45 with a mean of 58. CVP 11, PCWP 20. Inhaled NO was then 
initiated. His pressors were ultimately dobutamine, epinephrine, 
levophed, and vasopressin. Thermodilution cardiac output was 
3.68, index 2.3, SVR 1761, PVR 12.

Review of systems: Unable to assess d/t intubated and sedated 
status.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man w/ hep C, hep B cirrhosis w/ HCC, pulm HTN who 
presented with dyspnea on exertion progressing to rest dyspnea 
and ultimately hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring 
intubation. His hypoxia worsened despite multiple escalating 
interventions. The patient underwent 2 PEA arrests, which 
responded to epinephrine, compressions, and bagging. The patient 
was partially stabilized on inhaled nitrous oxide. Ultimately, 
after multiple family discussions, the patient was made CMO in 
accordance with his anticipated wishes. He was terminally 
extubated and expired from hypoxic respiratory failure.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure: The acute precipitant was 
unclear. Patient may have recently discontinued his macitentan. 
Etiology likely pulmonary hypertension with some component of 
infection in the setting of underlying COPD. CTA with no PE but 
with lingular ground glass opacity. He was intubated in the 
emergency department. We maintained paralysis for optimal 
respiratory dynamics. Patient with evidence of severe shunt 
physiology and with markedly elevated pressures on PA catheter. 
He decompensated with the addition of inhaled Flolan, but the 
interpretation of its effect was complicated by multiple 
concurrent hemodynamic issues. He mildly improved with inhaled 
nitric oxide and inotropic support.

# Refractory Shock, mixed cardiogenic and septic: Most likely 
cardiogenic secondary to RV failure. Possible septic component 
in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and possible lingular 
pneumonia. Pt required escalation of pressors to epinephrine, 
levophed, vasopressin, and dobutamine. He was treated with 
vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin. Pt had end-organ damage 
including ___ and acute liver injury. 

# Cardiac Arrest: Patient had 2 PEA arrests ___ due to hypoxemia 
w/ ROSC after 1 round each time. Unable to assess mental status 
after due to paralysis. Cooling protocol deferred due to concern 
for pulmonary vasoconstriction. The goal was for normothermia. 
He was placed on an EEG for monitoring. He had a formal Echo in 
the morning, which was not resulted by the time of the family's 
decision.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man w/ hep C, hep B cirrhosis w/ HCC, pulm HTN who
presented with dyspnea on exertion progressing to rest dyspnea
and ultimately hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
intubation. His hypoxia worsened despite multiple escalating
interventions. The patient underwent 2 PEA arrests, which
responded to epinephrine, compressions, and bagging. The patient
was partially stabilized on inhaled nitrous oxide. Ultimately,
after multiple family discussions, the patient was made CMO in
accordance with his anticipated wishes. He was terminally
extubated and expired from hypoxic respiratory failure.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: The acute precipitant was
unclear. Patient may have recently discontinued his macitentan.
Etiology likely pulmonary hypertension with some component of
infection in the setting of underlying COPD. CTA with no PE but
with lingular ground glass opacity. He was intubated in the
emergency department. We maintained paralysis for optimal
respiratory dynamics. Patient with evidence of severe shunt
physiology and with markedly elevated pressures on PA catheter.
He decompensated with the addition of inhaled Flolan, but the
interpretation of its effect was complicated by multiple
concurrent hemodynamic issues. He mildly improved with inhaled
nitric oxide and inotropic support.
# Refractory Shock, mixed cardiogenic and septic: Most likely
cardiogenic secondary to RV failure. Possible septic component
in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and possible lingular
pneumonia. Pt required escalation of pressors to epinephrine,
levophed, vasopressin, and dobutamine. He was treated with
vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin. Pt had end-organ damage
including ___ and acute liver injury.
# Cardiac Arrest: Patient had 2 PEA arrests ___ due to hypoxemia
w/ ROSC after 1 round each time. Unable to assess mental status
after due to paralysis. Cooling protocol deferred due to concern
for pulmonary vasoconstriction. The goal was for normothermia.
He was placed on an EEG for monitoring. He had a formal Echo in
the morning, which was not resulted by the time of the family's
decision.
