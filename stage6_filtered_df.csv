CT ABDOMEN / PELVIS: 
Thickening of wall of the stomach, which may represent

processes should be considered in the correct clinical setting. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ABDOMINAL PAIN, DYSURIA, URETHRAL PAIN: CT abd/pelvis with heavy 
fecal loading, I believe her abdominal pain and nausea in the 
setting of a history of IBS and dehydration is likely related to 
constipation.  She has small amt of watery stools which may be 
leaking around an impaction.  Will treat with colace, senna and 
miralax and a fleets enema today.  Narcotic pain medications are 
contraindicated in this case (pain from constipation).  I have 
discussed this extensively with the patient and she is demanding 
IV narcotics at least in the short term, I have discussed the 
reasons to not prescribe this and to work on the fecal loading / 
constipation issue first. U/a is negative, so unlikely related 
to any cystitis, will use pyridium for 3 days for symptoms to 
see if improve. Given h/o PUD will not use ibuprofen for pain. 
Tylenol prn..  F/u GC/Chlamydia.  Gastric thickening likely 
related to stomach underdistension but I have discussed this 
with the patient that she should see her PCP about this and will 
need an EGD for further workup or consultation with a GI 
specialist.  She understood this.  The patient left the hospital 
refusing to use bowel medications.  She stated that the only 
thing that worked for her was narcotic medications and if we

2. Medical: No acute or chronic issues

3. Psychiatric: 
#) ANXIETY
The patient has a reported longstanding history of anxiety 
dating back to early childhood. Her baseline generalized anxiety 
has predisposed her to current distress which is in excess of 
what would be expected following her acute stressors of being 
involved in a recent MVA and stress of work demands at school. 
Since the accident, the patient reports intrusive thoughts 
(without compulsions) revolving around the car accident that 
cause marked anxiety. The patient also reports a history of 
unprovoked panic attacks characterized by SOB, palpitations, 
sweating, lower extremity numbness, and depersonalization that 
have worsened in frequency since her car accident. Zoloft was 
restarted at 100mg rather than her previously prescribed dose of 
200mg to minimize activation side effects as the patient 
reported variable compliance with the medication. Propanolol for 
anxiety as needed was also used with no noted side effects. 
Ativan was discontinued as the patient reported no benefit.

Collateral Information: 
#) OUTPT TEAM - Patients outpatient Psychiatrist, Dr. 
___ therapist, ___, from ___ 
___ were contacted at time of admission in order 
to discuss circumstances of patients hospitalization and to 
obtain relevant history. They shared that the patient had been 
distraught and overwhelmed with school stress as well as coping 
with the retraumatization from the recent MVA. The patient's 
therapist mentioned that the patient has always had baseline 
anxiety but has managed to do very well in school. 

#) HOSPITAL RECORDS - No prior hospitalizations.

4. Social/Milieu: 
#) GROUPS - Patient attended many groups on the unit and was 
interactive with other patients.  

#) FAMILY - The patient's mother, ___, confirmed that the pt 
has a history of anxiety and tends to cope by getting angry with 
family members and then will feel better. ___ noticed that the 
pt is less angry when taking her Zoloft. ___ said that the pt 
has no history of suicide attempt and has never voiced SI to her 
parents. ___ did not believe there was an acute safety concern. 
She also felt that the recent car accident was a likely trigger 
to her current mood instability. 

5. Risk Assessment: 
The patient represents a potential chronic risk of impulsive and 
potentially dangerous behaviors given history of bullying, 
ongoing anxiety, and poor coping strategies. Protective factors 
include that he is currently in good behavioral control, 
medication compliant, future oriented and connected with outpt 
treatment. At this time, the acute risk has been diminished and 
the least restrictive setting for care is the outpatient 
setting.   

6. PROGNOSIS
Good - given lack of h/o self-harm, use of humor as a mature 
defense, motivation for positive change, and willingness to 
engage in care with many positive supports.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with rigith lower quadrant

found to have appendicitis.  You were taken to the operating 
room to have your appendix removed.  You are now preparing for 
discharge home with the following instructions:

 You were admitted to the hospital with acute appendicitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your appendix removed 
laparoscopically.  You tolerated the procedure well and are now 
being discharged home with the following instructions:
Please follow up at the appointment in clinic listed below. We 
also generally recommend that patients follow up with their 
primary care provider after having surgery. We have scheduled an 
appointment for you listed below.
ACTIVITY:
 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" a couple weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You could have a poor appetite for a couple days. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressings you have small plastic bandages 
called steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay.
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicaitons. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. Do not 
take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed. Do not drink alcohol or 
drive while taking narcotic pain medication.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted for induction of labor for 
chronic hypertension. She subsequently had persistent category 2 
fetal heart tracing as well as severe range blood pressures 
requiring an additional IV labetalol in addition to Nifedipine 
CR. She then underwent a low transverse cesarean section. 

She was started on magnesium sulfate immediately post partum for 
a planned total of 24 hours. However, at approximately 19 hours 
on magnesium, she became hypoxic to 85% on RA, improved to 93% 
on 4L NC. She had an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia, CXR 
which showed small pleural effusions, atelectasis, negative CTA, 
and a BNP within normal limits. On PPD#1 she was weaned to room 
air but still c/o intermittent SOB when supine. On PPD#2 she 
desaturated again to 86-91% while sleeping, which responded to 
1L NC at 95%. Later that day she was triggered for chest pain, 
BP 170/109, HR 140. She was given nifedipine 10mg which 
normalized her BP to the 120s. For her anti-hypertensive regimen 
she was started on Labetalol 200 TID. She had a repeat EKG which 
again demonstrated sinus tachycardia, CXR with persistent 
atelectasis. Repeat CBC, chem-10, BNP were stable; troponins 
were negative. PIH labs were also within normal limits. 
Cardiology was consulted who recommended continuation of 
labetalol and non-urgent echo. The echocardiogram showed mild 
symmetric LVH; normal global biventricular systolic function; 
Mild mitral regurgitation; Trivial posterior pericardial 
effusion versus fat pad. On PPD#3 she was noted to have a ___ 
HA, with dizziness upon standing, hypertensive to 160s/100s, and 
tachycardic to 111. Her HA improved with ibuprofen, Tylenol, 
oxycodone, reglan, and Ativan. Her BP and HR also improved with 
scheduled labetalol. Orthostatics obtained were negative. 

On PPD#1 she was also started on ampicillin, gentamicin, and 
clindamycin for presumed endometritis after becoming febrile. 
This was continued for 24 hours after her first afebrile 
temperature. She remained afebrile throughout the remainder of 
her postpartum course. 

For her history of hypothyroidism she was continued on levoxyl 
200mcg. She was also started on prophylactic Lovenox BID due to 
increased BMI. 

By postpartum day 4, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was 
then discharged home in stable condition with postpartum 
outpatient follow-up scheduled.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___  Left lateral sectionectomy, intraoperative ultrasound, 
cholecystectomy, and incidental umbilical hernia repair.

 
History of Present Illness:
___ man who presented to the emergency department with 
acute onset of abdominal pain.
He noted increase in his abdominal girth over the past several 
months.  Imaging demonstrated a large mass off the left lateral 
section.  He was transferred to our institution for further 
evaluation.  CT was reviewed and suggested a
torsed left lateral section with a mass lesion containing fat.  
A sulfur colloid scan demonstrated no significant uptake in the 
majority of the left lateral section, consistent with adenoma or 
infarcted FNH.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male with history of abdominal mass seen on CT, was 
having increased abdominal pain. He is now taken to the OR with 
Dr. ___ for resection.
.
At the time of the surgery, upon opening of the abdomen, the 
left lateral section and mass were delivered through the 
incision onto the abdominal wall. When the mass was examined, it 
was clearly torsed fully 360 degrees from its normal axis and it 
was manually untorsed.  The lateral section did appear somewhat 
ischemic but not frankly necrotic. A left lateral sectionectomy 
was performed. Given the presence of polyps and the patient's 
strong family history of gallbladder problems, largely
stones, the gallbladder was also removed to avoid further 
monitoring and possible future surgery. Additionally the small 
umbilical hernia was repaired as part of this surgery.
.
Post operatively the patient had an epidural. The epidural was 
initially split but he was still was not having good pain 
coverage at the site of the incision, and was taken back by APS 
for a regional block that seemed more effective with pain 
control.
.
Liver function tests did increase following the surgery, peak 
bilirubin occurred on POD 2 with result of 1.4. By day of 
discharge all LFTs were trending down (ALT 49 AST 51, Alk Phos 
207 and T Bili 0.4) He did not show any signs of encephalopathy 
and synthetic function was normal. 
.
Otherwise the patient did well after his surgery. He was 
ambulating, he voided without difficulty after the Foley 
catheter was removed. The incision was clean dry and intact. 
There was some erythema around the incision that looked like a 
tape reaction. He was afebrile and tolerating a regular diet 
prior to discharge.
.

EGD: A 1.5cm cratered, oozing ulcer was found just below the 
cardia. Given its location, it was extremely difficult to 
perform any intervention. Both the standard endoscope and side 
viewing endoscope were used without any success.  

Abdominal/Pelvic CT: No significant abnormality is identified in 
the visualized portions of the lung bases. A large 13.5 cm x 8.9 
cm x 10.5 cm soft tissue mass with central necrosis is 
visualized in the mid-upper abdomen. The lesion is in continuity 
with the lesser curvature of the stomach and abuts the left 
hepatic lobe without a clear plane of separation. The lesion 
also abuts the anterosuperior aspect of the pancreatic head and 
body. The lesion encases the left gastric artery but does not 
involve the celiac artery or hepatic artery. The superior 
mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein and portal vein are 
separate from the lesion. A 1.8 cm x 1.5 cm area of low 
attenuation at the gastroesophageal junction (series 3, image 
14) most likely represents a small amount of fluid related to 
hiatus hernia. No significant abdominal lymphadenopathy is 
identified. No focal parenchymal abnormality is seen in the 
liver, spleen, or adrenal glands. A 1.5 cm x 1.6 cm exophytic 
cortical cyst is identified at the lower pole of the left 
kidney. No significant small or large bowel dilatation. A small 
linear area of hyperattenuation in the lumen of proximal small 
bowel (series 400b, image 31) most likely represents a tablet or 
foreign body material. No pelvic lymphadenopathy is identified. 
The urinary bladder is unremarkable in appearance. A few focal 
areas of calcification are seen in the central portion of the 
prostate gland. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are 
identified in the bony skeleton. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On the morning of admission to the hospital on ___ a repeat 
endoscopy was performed. He  was found to have a bleeding 
gastric ulcer in the cardia which was not reachable for 
intervention by the endoscopist. He was accordingly admitted to 
the hospital for further management. During this period of time 
he remained stable. A CT scan of the abdomen was then obtained. 
This study showed a very large mass measuring at least 15 cm in 
size and seemingly arising from the lesser curve of the stomach. 
It had quite a bit of internal necrosis. The diagnosis was that 
the patient had a large gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor that 
had eroded through the mucosa forming the ulcer. The  concern 
was for rupture given the large size and the extensive necrosis. 
The patient was taken to the operating room as aforementioned. 

Neuro: Morphine PCA was utilized immediately post-operative for 
pain control, this was transitioned to oral medications once the 
patient was tolerating a liquid diet.

Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted to the ICU post-op for 
close hemodynamic monitoring, vitals were monitored per unit 
routine. An arterial line was placed during at the time of 
operation for hemodynamic monitoring. It was discontinued on POD 
#1. After transfer to the floor, vital signs were monitored 
closely per unit routine. 

Resp: Continuous 02 saturations wre monitored while patient was 
in the ICU, supplemental oxygenwas provided to maintain 02 
saturations. Upon transfer to the floor 02 saturations were 
checked with vital signs per unit routine. Early ambulation was 
encouraged, incentive spirometry was utilized. 

GI: Post-operatively the patient was made NPO and an NGT was in 
placed to low continuous wall suction. It was removed on POD #3. 
 After NGT removal sips of clear liquids were started, this was 
advanced to clear liquids on POD #4, and regular diet on POD #5. 
IV protonix was started immediately post-operatively. This was 
transitioned to PO once the patient was tolerating a regular

EGD: A 1.5cm cratered, oozing ulcer was found just below the
cardia. Given its location, it was extremely difficult to
perform any intervention. Both the standard endoscope and side
viewing endoscope were used without any success.
Abdominal/Pelvic CT: No significant abnormality is identified in
the visualized portions of the lung bases. A large 13.5 cm x 8.9
cm x 10.5 cm soft tissue mass with central necrosis is
visualized in the mid-upper abdomen. The lesion is in continuity
with the lesser curvature of the stomach and abuts the left
hepatic lobe without a clear plane of separation. The lesion
also abuts the anterosuperior aspect of the pancreatic head and
body. The lesion encases the left gastric artery but does not
involve the celiac artery or hepatic artery. The superior
mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein and portal vein are
separate from the lesion. A 1.8 cm x 1.5 cm area of low
attenuation at the gastroesophageal junction (series 3, image
14) most likely represents a small amount of fluid related to
hiatus hernia. No significant abdominal lymphadenopathy is
identified. No focal parenchymal abnormality is seen in the
liver, spleen, or adrenal glands. A 1.5 cm x 1.6 cm exophytic
cortical cyst is identified at the lower pole of the left
kidney. No significant small or large bowel dilatation. A small
linear area of hyperattenuation in the lumen of proximal small
bowel (series 400b, image 31) most likely represents a tablet or
foreign body material. No pelvic lymphadenopathy is identified.
The urinary bladder is unremarkable in appearance. A few focal
areas of calcification are seen in the central portion of the
prostate gland. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified in the bony skeleton.
Brief Hospital Course:
On the morning of admission to the hospital on ___ a repeat
endoscopy was performed. He was found to have a bleeding
gastric ulcer in the cardia which was not reachable for
intervention by the endoscopist. He was accordingly admitted to
the hospital for further management. During this period of time
he remained stable. A CT scan of the abdomen was then obtained.
This study showed a very large mass measuring at least 15 cm in
size and seemingly arising from the lesser curve of the stomach.
It had quite a bit of internal necrosis. The diagnosis was that
the patient had a large gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor that
had eroded through the mucosa forming the ulcer. The concern
was for rupture given the large size and the extensive necrosis.
The patient was taken to the operating room as aforementioned.
Neuro: Morphine PCA was utilized immediately post-operative for
pain control, this was transitioned to oral medications once the
patient was tolerating a liquid diet.
Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted to the ICU post-op for
close hemodynamic monitoring, vitals were monitored per unit
routine. An arterial line was placed during at the time of
operation for hemodynamic monitoring. It was discontinued on POD
#1. After transfer to the floor, vital signs were monitored
closely per unit routine.
Resp: Continuous 02 saturations wre monitored while patient was
in the ICU, supplemental oxygenwas provided to maintain 02
saturations. Upon transfer to the floor 02 saturations were
checked with vital signs per unit routine. Early ambulation was
encouraged, incentive spirometry was utilized.
GI: Post-operatively the patient was made NPO and an NGT was in
placed to low continuous wall suction. It was removed on POD #3. After NGT removal sips of clear liquids were started, this was
advanced to clear liquids on POD #4, and regular diet on POD #5.
IV protonix was started immediately post-operatively. This was
transitioned to PO once the patient was tolerating a regular
diet.
Renal: Foley catheter was placed at the time of procedure. Urine
output was closely monitored post-operatively. It was removed on
POD #3, and the patient voided without difficulty. Electrolytes
were monitored and repleted as necessary. Lactated ringers was
started post-op, this was changed to D51/2NS, fluids were

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with acute appendicitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your appendix removed 
laparoscopically.  Postoperatively, you developed a couple of 
abscesses that required drainage. You tolerated the procedure 
well and are now being discharged home with the drains.  Please 
note the following instructions:
You should follow up at the appointment in clinic listed below. 
We also generally recommend that patients follow up with their 
primary care provider after having surgery. We have scheduled an 
appointment for you listed below.
ACTIVITY:
 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs.
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL:
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" a couple weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You could have a poor appetite for a couple days. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressings you have small plastic bandages 
called steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay.
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicaitons. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon.
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"".
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. Do not 
take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed. Do not drink alcohol or 
drive while taking narcotic pain medication.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a fall and were found to 
have multiple right-sided rib fractures.  You received pain 
medication and your breathing was monitored.  You were evaluated 
by Physical Therapy who cleared you for discharge home. 

You are now ready to be discharged from the hospital.  Please 
follow the instructions below to ensure a safe recovery:

* Your injury caused right-sided rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

obtained which showed an old Right Bundle Branch Block 
consistent with a previous EKG in ___, but no new 
changes.  CBC and electrolytes were within normal limits with 
the exception of an elevated BUN, consistent with prerenal 
azotemia secondary to dehydration.  Based on her history, exam, 
and laboratory findings, her episode of syncope was felt to be 
associated with her history of POTS, possibly triggered by 
hypovolemia.  She was observed overnight and was afebrile with 
stable vital signs throughout her stay.  She received IV 
maintenance fluids.  She was stable on discharge and is

IMAGING

HEAD CT
Left basal ganglia and left intrathalamic hemorrhage with 
extension into the left and right lateral ventricles and new 
extension into the fourth ventricle. 

CT C-SPINE: Mild multilevel degenerative change. No acute 
fractures.

MRI/MRA BRAIN
1. Large left basal ganglia/lentiform nucleus acute hemorrhage. 
No definite evidence of an underlying AVM or mass lesion, though 
evaluation is limited due to edema and mass effect from this 
large hematoma. 
2. Multiple foci of susceptibility are seen throughout both 
cerebral 
hemispheres and cerebellum most consistent with amyloid 
angiopathy. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit 
intubated under the neurosurgical service. 
On neurologic examination, he was unarousable even off sedation, 
with spontaneous movement of the left side, hemiparesis of the 
right side, and no withdrawal to painful stimuli throughout. 
Brainstem reflexes were intact. 
Patient remained hypertensive in the ICU requiring a Nicardipine 
gtt 24 hours after admission. His exam improved slightly on day 
2 with eye opening to nox and attempts to flex on his right to 
nox stimuli. However, this was the best his exam became, and he 
seemed to deteriorate after this. Multiple repeat head CT scans 
showed stable size of bleed, with stable intraventricular blood. 

Neurosurgery opted not to intervene and patient was transferred 
to neuro ICU service. 
An MRI/MRA was done to look for an underlying lesion or vascular 
anomoly. This showed extensive microbleeds consistent with 
amyloid angiopathy. This, combined with HTN, was the likely 
cause of this large bleed. 
ICH scale was ___, giving him a 72-97% chance of mortality 
within 30 days. 
After extensive discussion with his entire family including wife 
and children, decision was made to make him comfort measures 
only. He was extubated ___ at 9pm. 
Palliative care consult was involved. Patient expired on 
___ at 10:11 am.

epidural catheter was placed by the pain service. It was
difficult to access the effectiveness of the epidural related to
the patients cognitive status so the decision was made to
initiate a standing oral regimen for pain control. The patient
was then change to standing Tylenol and Ultram for pain
management and the epidural catheter was discontinued.
On CT, the patient had a multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage. She
was followed closely by trauma surgery and neurosurgery and
serial CT scans of the head were preformed. Ct of the head from
___ showed stable appearance of multifocal subarachnoid
hemorrhage, a large right parietal subgaleal hematoma, no new
focus of hemorrhage, and no mass effect.
The patient remained stable on the floor for the duration of her
hospital stay. At the time of discharge her vital signs were
stable, she was able to take food and drink by mouth, and mental
status is unchanged from baseline. Physical therapy was
consulted for evaluation of functional status and recommended a
rehabilitation facility for improvement of functional status to
baseline. At home, the patient is able to ambulate independently
and currently needs an increased level of assistance.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was a same day admit, and on ___ he was brought 
to the operating room where he underwent a off-pump coronary 
artery bypass graft x 2. Please see operative note for surgical 
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for 
invasive monotoring in stable condition. On post-op day one he 
was started on beta blockers and diuretics and gently diuresed 
towards his pre-op weight. Later on this day he was transferred 
to the telemetry floor for further care. Chest tubes and 
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. 

On POD 2 he developed a fever to 103. Urine and blood cultures 
were sent. Both were negative.  His chest radiographs were not 
suspicious for pneumonia and he was doing well with his 
incentive spirometry.  By post operative day four his right vein 
harvest site became erythematous and warm.  He was started on 
Kefzol and his white blood cell count, leg erythema, and 
temperatures all improved by the following day.
He gradually improved while working with physical therapy for 
strength and mobility and on post-op day five he was discharged 
home with ___ services on Keflex for his vein harvest site 
erythema.

CT TORSO SECOND READ
1. Mesenteric fat stranding and multiple lymph nodes measuring 
up to 2.4 cm in 
the mesentery around the celiac trunk, pancreatic head and porta 
hepatic is of 
uncertain significance.  No evidence of septic emboli 
2. Small to moderate amount of pericardial effusion. 

TTE 
Moderate pericardial effusion with echo evidence of early 
tamponade physiology. No 2D
echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. Low-normal left 
ventricular systolic function. Note, the absence
of a discrete vegetation on echocardiography does not exclude 
the diagnosis of endocarditis. If clinically
indicated, a TEE could be considered for further evaluation of 
endocarditis.

NCCTH
There is symmetric relative hypointensity of the globus pallidus 
and putamen 
bilaterally, which can be seen in hypoxic or toxic 
encephalopathy. Given the 
history of concern for endocarditis, septic emboli cannot be 
excluded.  No 
foci of hyperdensity are noted to suggest hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ substance use disorder including IVDU who presented from 
BI-P in undifferentiated shock. He had been intubated for airway 
protection. Upon arrival to ___, he was noted to have a 
pericardial effusion w/ early tamponade physiology on surface 
echo, underwent pericardiocentesis in which 250cc fluid was 
removed and a pericardial drain was left in place. Upon arrival 
to the MICU, he had deteriorated iwth an increased pressor 
requirement volume resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics. 
 In setting of ___ and lactic acidosis, his pH worsened and 
he was started emergently on CRRT.  He continued to 
decompensated hemodynamically, ultimately maxing out on 4 
pressors within a matter of hours of ICU arrival. Broad spectrum 
antimicrobials were administered despite no clear source of 
infection. Repeat bedside TTE done in ICU that was s/f mild 
global hypokinesis I/s/o severe metabolic acidosis, but no 
significant valvular pathology, focal WMAss, or recurrent 
effusion was noted. Given patient's rapidly deteriorating 
condition, a goals of care conversation with family let to a 
decision to transition to DNR. BP continued to drift down 
despite maximal pressors, and patient ultimately lost his pulse 
and died. His case was accepted by medical examiner, and family 
was in agreement with an autopsy.

IMAGING
=======
CT TORSO SECOND READ
1. Mesenteric fat stranding and multiple lymph nodes measuring
up to 2.4 cm in
the mesentery around the celiac trunk, pancreatic head and porta
hepatic is of
uncertain significance. No evidence of septic emboli
2. Small to moderate amount of pericardial effusion.
TTE
Moderate pericardial effusion with echo evidence of early
tamponade physiology. No 2D
echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. Low-normal left
ventricular systolic function. Note, the absence
of a discrete vegetation on echocardiography does not exclude
the diagnosis of endocarditis. If clinically
indicated, a TEE could be considered for further evaluation of
endocarditis.
NCCTH
There is symmetric relative hypointensity of the globus pallidus
and putamen
bilaterally, which can be seen in hypoxic or toxic
encephalopathy. Given the
history of concern for endocarditis, septic emboli cannot be
excluded. No
foci of hyperdensity are noted to suggest hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ substance use disorder including IVDU who presented from
BI-P in undifferentiated shock. He had been intubated for airway
protection. Upon arrival to ___, he was noted to have a
pericardial effusion w/ early tamponade physiology on surface
echo, underwent pericardiocentesis in which 250cc fluid was
removed and a pericardial drain was left in place. Upon arrival
to the MICU, he had deteriorated iwth an increased pressor
requirement volume resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics. In setting of ___ and lactic acidosis, his pH worsened and
he was started emergently on CRRT. He continued to
decompensated hemodynamically, ultimately maxing out on 4
pressors within a matter of hours of ICU arrival. Broad spectrum
antimicrobials were administered despite no clear source of
infection. Repeat bedside TTE done in ICU that was s/f mild
global hypokinesis I/s/o severe metabolic acidosis, but no
significant valvular pathology, focal WMAss, or recurrent
effusion was noted. Given patient's rapidly deteriorating
condition, a goals of care conversation with family let to a
decision to transition to DNR. BP continued to drift down
despite maximal pressors, and patient ultimately lost his pulse
and died. His case was accepted by medical examiner, and family
was in agreement with an autopsy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This ___ woman with a
history of depression and multiple suicide attempts was found
hanging by a belt in her closet today by her grandmother. She
was seen 30 minutes prior and was asystolic when found. The
paramedics were able to regain a pulse after performing CPR
and she was transferred to ___. CT scan revealed
severe cerebral edema and the patient was given steroids and
transferred to our ___.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for depression, multiple
episodes of drug overdoses, prior suicide attempts, and drug
abuse.

ALLERGIES:  She was allergic to Vicodin.

MEDICATIONS:  Included chlorpromazine, trazodone, alprazolam,
citalopram.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient was
unresponsive with fixed pupils in a cervical collar. There
were no other obvious injuries other than the neurological
injuries and where she did not withdraw to pain and the neck
injury from her hanging. The patient was admitted with a very
severe neurological dysfunction to the intensive care unit.
She was supported and ventilated. She initially had some
agonal breathing respirations. She was thought to have a
devastating brain injury, but because of some episodes of
initiation of breath she was not thought to be brain dead and
discussions were had with the family with respect to donation
after cardiac death which was agreed to. A repeat examination
showed that the patient was indeed brain dead and all
criteria were satisfied. The patient was then declared dead
and donation proceeded according to brain death criteria
protocol.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Severe anoxia secondary to suicide attempt
and hanging.

DISPOSITION:  The patient became an organ donor.

Pertinent Results:
___ Intraop TEE:
Pre-bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous 
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium 
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D 
or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed 
(LVEF= 45 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward 
the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are 
myxomatous. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Moderate to 
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric 
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

Post-bypass: The patient is not receiving inotropic support 
post-CPB. There is a well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring. There 
is no mitral regurgitation. There is a transvalvular mean 
gradient of 3 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 5.8 L/min. 
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all findings 
are consistent with pre-bypass findings. The aorta is intact 
post-decannulation. All findings were discussed with the surgeon 
intraoperatively.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Dr. ___ a mitral valve repair and 
closure of a patent foramen ovale.  See operative note for 
details. Following surgery, he was transferred to the CVICU for 
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically 
intact and extubated without incident. Chest tubes were removed 
per protocol and low dose beta blockade was initiated. He went 
on to develop complete heart block, requiring temporary pacing. 
Beta blockade was subsequently stopped. EP service was consulted 
and attributed AV block to AV nodal edema. His rhythm was 
observed for several days and his AV block resolved. He went on 
to develop first degree AV block with conversion to persistent 
atrial fibrillation/flutter. He remained asymptomatic and pacing 
wires were eventually removed on postoperative day nine. 
Warfarin was eventually started and dosed for a goal INR between 
2.0 and 3.0. All nodal agents continued to be withheld and EP 
service felt pacemaker was not indicated at this time. Mr. 
___ will followup with EP/cardiology as an outpatient. At 
time of discharge, INR was subtherapeutic but will be followed 
closely by ___ Cardiology Clinic. The remainder of 
his postoperative course was routine and he was cleared for 
discharge to home on postoperative day nine.

Discharge Instructions:
Despite the fact that no skin incisions were used, the area 
around the ureter and bladder is irritated. The stent is 
required in order keep the ureter open and urine flowing from 
the kidney to the bladder. Because one end of the ureter is in 
the bladder, it can cause irritation to the bladder. Therefore, 
it is normal to feel that you need the urge to urinate 
frequently when the stent is in place. Although the stent can be 
uncomfortable, it is important to have the stent to avoid 
damaging the kidney and ureter after your procedure. You may see 
some blood in your urine while the stent is in place and a few 
days afterward. Drink lots of fluid  this will help clear up 
your urine.

raw surface of your bladder, alcohol, spicy foods, acidy foods 
and drinks with caffeine may cause irritation or frequency and

and to avoid constipation, drink plenty of fluids during the day 
(8 - 10 glasses).

if you are very active, you may see some blood in the urine. We 
would suggest to cut down your activity under these 
circumstances until the bleeding has stopped.

postoperative period. Straining with bowel movements can cause 
bleeding. A bowel movement every other day is reasonable. Use a 
mild laxative if needed, such as Milk of Magnesia ___ 
Tablespoons, or 2 Dulcolax tablets. Call if you continue to have 
problems. If you had been taking narcotics for pain, before, 
during or after your surgery, you may be constipated. Take a 
laxative if necessary.

Medication
You should resume your pre-surgery medications unless told not 
to. In addition you will often be given an antibiotic to prevent 
infection. These should be taken as prescribed until the bottles 
are finished unless you are having an unusual reaction to one of 
the drugs.

Problems You Should Report to Us 
a. Fevers over 100.5 Fahrenheit.
b. Heavy bleeding, or clots (See notes above about blood in 
urine).

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. ___ underwent a cardiac cath 
which revealed severe coronary artery disease. Following cardiac 
cath he was admitted for surgical work-up. On ___ he was 
brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary 
artery bypass graft x 4,with a left internal mammary artery 
graft to the left
anterior descending and reversed saphenous vein grafts to the 
marginal branch, diagonal branch, and right coronary artery with 
___. Please see operative report for further surgical 
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for 
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was 
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. 
On post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers and diuretics 
and diuresed back to his pre-op weight. Later on this day he was 
transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes 
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He 
continued to make good progress while working with physical 
therapy for strength and mobility. On post-op day three he 
required a blood transfusion due to low HCT and blood pressure. 
He continued to progress and was cleared for discharge to home 
on POD#4. All follow up appointments were advised.

___ of Present Illness:
___ is a healthy ___ woman who had a bladder 
infection
two months ago presented with dysuria, urgency, and frequency. 
No nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills.  She was thought to
potentially have pyelonephritis and underwent a CT scan at that
time.  This was performed at ___.  It showed a 3-cm lesion in 
the left kidney, but it was solid and quite suspicious.  She 
underwent a followup MRI on
___, again revealing a 3-cm lesion partially exophytic,
well defined, majority of which is endophytic inside the kidney,
and suspicious for either chromophobe renal cell or oncocytoma. 
She appears to have a single renal artery and renal vein with no
obvious adenopathy.

She does complain of lower right back pain for years.  No gross
hematuria and no left flank pain.

 
Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:  Chest pain, focal three months ago;
intermittent shortness of breath; and dizziness.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing robot-assisted 
laparoscopic left partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic left 
salpingo-oophorectomy. No concerning intraoperative events 
occurred; please see dictated operative notes for details. The 
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition.  In the PACU, she was noted to have left eye redness 
and pain, and an ophthalmology consult was requested.  She was 
felt to have a left corneal abraison likely secondary to 
exposure during surgery versus scratching her eye post-op as she 
was waking up from her anesthesia.  She was given antibiotic 
ointment and artificial tears per Ophtho recommendations.  On 
POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated for urine output 
>30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and incentive 
spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient ambulated, 
restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel and 
complete blood count were checked, pain control was transitioned 
from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a clears/toast 
and crackers diet. On POD2, JP and urethral catheter (foley) 
were removed without difficulty and diet was advanced as 
tolerated. The remainder of the hospital course was relatively 
unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable condition, 
eating well, ambulating independently, voiding without 
difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, 
incisions were clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of 
hematoma, collection or infection. The patient was given 
explicit instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. ___ in 
___ weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the Orthopedic service on ___ for 
bilateral tibia plateau, bilateral proximal humerus and a left 
scaphoid fracture after being evaluated and treated with closed 
reduction in the emergency room.  She underwent open reduction 
internal fixation of the left tibial plateau fracture and 
external fixation of the right tibial plateau fracture without 
complication on ___. Please see operative report for full 
details. She was extubated without difficulty and transferred to 
the recovery room in stable condition. She returned to the OR on 
___ for removal of the external fixator and open reduction 
internal fixation of the right tibial plateau fracture. Please

and was transferred to the floor in stable condition.

On hospital day 2 she was transfused 3 units of packed red blood 
cells over the next 2 days for post-operative anemia. On 
hospital day 4 she complained of shortness of breath and chest 
tightness. An EKG was ordered but was unremarkable. given the 
extent of her multiple injuries and surgeries, a CT angiogram 
was ordered, which revealed a filling defect in a segmental 
branch of the pulmonary artery feeding the lingula. She was not 
switched to therapeutic anticoagulation but remained on a 
prophylactic dose, because it was felt that this finding did not 
correlate with her physical exam.  

She had adequate pain management and worked with physical 
therapy while in the hospital.  The remainder of her hospital 
course was uneventful and Ms. ___ is being discharged to rehab 
in stable condition. She will follow up in clinic in 2 weeks for

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after a bicycle crash. You were found 
to have left sided rib fractures and a splenic infarct (versus 
laceration). You blood levels were monitored and there was no 
signs of bleeding. Your pain was controlled and ___ has cleared 
you for discharge home to continue your  recovery. 

Liver/ Spleen lacerations:

*AVOID contact sports and/or any activity that may cause injury 
to your abdominal area for the next ___ weeks.
 
*If you suddenly become dizzy, lightheaded, feeling as if you 
are going to pass out go to the nearest Emergency Room as this 
could be a sign that you are having internal bleeding from your 
liver or spleen injury.

* Your injury caused multiple left rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

Discharge Diagnosis:
[] Multiple nondisplaced posterior rib fractures are noted in
the left second, third, fifth, and sixth ribs
[] Splenic infarct vs laceration
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after a bicycle crash. You were found
to have left sided rib fractures and a splenic infarct (versus
laceration). You blood levels were monitored and there was no
signs of bleeding. Your pain was controlled and ___ has cleared
you for discharge home to continue your recovery.
Liver/ Spleen lacerations:
*AVOID contact sports and/or any activity that may cause injury
to your abdominal area for the next ___ weeks.
*If you suddenly become dizzy, lightheaded, feeling as if you
are going to pass out go to the nearest Emergency Room as this
could be a sign that you are having internal bleeding from your
liver or spleen injury.
* Your injury caused multiple left rib fractures which can cause
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths
because of the pain.
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and
notify your physician.
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and
deep breathing.
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.
* Do NOT smoke
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin,
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs (crepitus).

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with RA, recurrent Cdiff colitis admitted with frequent 
stools (not liquid) and dry heaves and LLQ tenderness, with 
negative evaluation for new infection or IBD.

#Diarrhea
#Recurrent cdiff

While admitted she did not have diarrhea.  She underwent CT 
abdomen that showed significant improvement in sigmoid bowel 
thickening seen on prior CT at ___ last month.  She 
experienced epigastric pain.  GI consulted and performed 
endoscopy and colonoscopy that were normal.  Because her 
diarrhea improved and they felt she had adequate response to 
treatment for what was considered first recurrence of cdiff, her 
vanco and rifaxamin were stopped.  Eventually able to send stool 
for micro studies, with negative giardia.  

She had no significant diarrhea while hospitalized, but some 
nausea and decreased appetite.  After normal EGD and 
colonoscopy, symptoms were most likely related to a post 
infectious irritable bowel disease, and she was started on 
symptomatic treatment. 

She did continue to have nausea, and decreased appetite, and may 
benefit from nutrition evaluation after discharge.

suggestive of obstruction, as well as gallbladder distention and
wall thickening suggestive of infection. Patient was admitted to
the service and started on IV hydration and broad spectrum
antibiotics, with resolution of fever and abdominal pain.
Subsequently, an ERCP was performed and her previous stent was
not observed and had likely migrated out. A new stent was placed
successfully with return of bile. She recovered from this
procedure well and was tolerating a regular diet. At time of
discharge she was eating well, passing flatus, voiding, and
ambulating appropriately. She will be discharged home and will
follow-up for her regularly scheduled surgery next week. During
this hospitalization she had labs, UA, CXR, and EKG for
pre-operative testing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Given that CT showed 4mm R UVJ stone with new elevation in Cr 
from 1.3 from 1.7, patient was admitted to the urology service 
for further observation.  Overnight, he was placed on aggressive 
IVF hydration and pain controlled.  He was also given a single 
dose of ceftriaxone.  On the morning of HD 2, he continued to 
require IV narcotics for pain control and also experienced an 
elevation in his Cr to 2.0.  As such, the decision was made to 
proceed to the OR for operative intervention.

He underwent cystoscopy, right ureteroscopy, laser lithotriospy, 
biopsy, and stent placement. Abnormal tissue was encountered in 
the mid-ureter which was likely reactive. A biopsy and cytology 
was obtained. 

He tolerated the procedure well; see the dictated operative note 
for full details. He recovered in the PACU.  His diet was 
advanced as tolerated there, where he remained afebrile with 
excellent pain control.  

Given that the patient's pain was controlled with oral pain 
medications, tolerating regular diet, ambulating without 
assistance, and voiding without difficulty, he was discharged 
home after the procedure.  

Patient was explicitly advised to follow up as directed as the 
indwelling ureteral stent must be removed and or exchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Given that CT showed 4mm R UVJ stone with new elevation in Cr
from 1.3 from 1.7, patient was admitted to the urology service
for further observation. Overnight, he was placed on aggressive
IVF hydration and pain controlled. He was also given a single
dose of ceftriaxone. On the morning of HD 2, he continued to
require IV narcotics for pain control and also experienced an
elevation in his Cr to 2.0. As such, the decision was made to
proceed to the OR for operative intervention.
He underwent cystoscopy, right ureteroscopy, laser lithotriospy,
biopsy, and stent placement. Abnormal tissue was encountered in
the mid-ureter which was likely reactive. A biopsy and cytology
was obtained.
He tolerated the procedure well; see the dictated operative note
for full details. He recovered in the PACU. His diet was
advanced as tolerated there, where he remained afebrile with
excellent pain control.
Given that the patient's pain was controlled with oral pain
medications, tolerating regular diet, ambulating without
assistance, and voiding without difficulty, he was discharged
home after the procedure.
Patient was explicitly advised to follow up as directed as the
indwelling ureteral stent must be removed and or exchanged.

suboccipital craniotomy, with expected 
post-operative changes. There are a few, approximately 4- mm 
sized punctate foci of T1- hyperintensity (4:12, 4:11, 4:10) in 
the surgical resection bed, which have corresponding 
susceptibility artifact on gradient- recalled echo sequence, and 
likely represent small residual foci of post- operative 
hemorrhage. On T1W post- gadolinium sequences, there is more 
planar or sheet like enhancement along the ___ aspect of 
the tentorium which likely relates to operative manipulation. On 
T1W MP-RAGE and SE post- gadolinium sequences, there are several 
small enhancing vessels seen along the posterior aspect of the 
surgical resection bed, seen on the pre-operative study, which 
likely represent normal vessels at the margin of the surgical 
resection bed. Allowing for the above, no definitive evidence 
for residual tumor is seen. The ventricles and sulci are normal 
in size and in contour. There is no shift of normally-midline 
structures. No new enhancing mass is identified. No foci 
concerning for infarction seen on diffusion- weighted imaging.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was electively admitted on ___ for suboccipital 
craniotomy for cerebellar mass resection. Intraoperatively, she 
diureised nearly seven liters of urine, which was treated with 
albumin and crystalloid IV fluids. Due to the excessive urine 
output, and elecated lactate in this setting, she was kept 
intubated overnight in the ICU for concerns of potential airway 
compromise. 

On POD#1, DVT prophylaxsis was started, and MRI of the head was 
performed to evaluate for residual tumor burden.  Post operative 
MR imaging was obtained routinely. She has been followed by 
Neuro-oncology, social service, ___ and OT while inpt. She has 
progressed as expected in the immediate post op course with no 
perioperative complications. She is tolerating all p.o. food and 
fluid well. She will follow up as outlined in the Neurosurgery

found to have effacement of the submental crease, diffuse
omental tenderness, firm swelling with a focal area of erythema
just
anterior to the presumed location of the submental crease. Using
local anesthesia, a 19-gauge needle was used to aspirate
approximately 2.5 mL of purulent material, which was followed by
an incision and drainage creating a 1 cm incision. The wound
was packed with quarter-inch Iodoform and a culture was sent.
She was admitted to the hospital and placed on Unasyn. The
cultures
were positive for beta hemolytic strep. She was discharged
three days later, afebrile, and tolerating a diet. She was

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a ___ G1P0->1 who initially presented to Labor and 
Delivery on ___ for scheduled cesarean section for 
posterior placenta previa.  Operation was complicated by large 
endometriotic implant at the left anterior fundus, bladder with 
cystotomy at the dome, normal trigone, negative ___ flush 
after cystotomy repair, and extensive adhesions.  Due to the 
complexity of the case, a T-skin incision was undertaken.  A 
classical uterine incision undertaken to avoid an 
intraoperatively suspected placenta perceta which was later 
found to in fact be a large endometriotic implant.  Please see 
operative report for details.  Post-op course was complicated by 
the following:

1. Post Op Tachycardia: On POD #2 pt tachycardic into the 120s 
with normal blood pressure and pulse ox.  Pt never complained of 
chest pain or shortness of breath.  EKG at the time demonstrated 
sinus tachycardia.  Pt's pain was not well controlled at the 
time, and had been noted to have postpartum fever for which she 
was being treated with IV gentamicin and clindamicin x24hours 
afebrile.  Tachycardia was attributed to poor pain control and 
fever and resolved with better pain management and resolution of 
infection.  

2. Intraoperative cystotomy and repair.  The patient was treated 
with three days of cefazolin IV/cephalexin po postoperatively.  
Her foley was maintained 10 days postop.

3. Acute blood loss anemia.  Patient had a low preoperative 
hematocrit of 27.6 and was transfused 2 units pRBC for an 
intraop hematocrit of 22 with appropriate rise in her hematocrit 
to 25.6. Her hematocrit then fell postoperatively to a nadir of 
20.5, at which time she was slightly tachycardic to 104 and 
tachypnic to 24, but able to stand and ambulate without 
lightheadedness.  Pt's abdomen remained soft and urine output 
was adequate therefore active bleeding intra-abdominally not 
suspected.  A repeat transfusion of 2 units pRBC was recommended 
to the patient at that time and she was counseled extensively 
regarding the risks and benefits.  She refused transfusion, and 
her vital signs later spontaneously returned to normal.  She had 
no further clinical symptoms of anemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with a PMH notable for type II diabetes and 
HTN presenting with likely recurrent syncope over 24 hours.  

ACTIVE ISSUES
#SYNCOPE: Recurrent over the 24 hours prior to admission. The 
patient has never experienced these symptoms before. She 
reported a history of a heart problem diagnosed in ___, 
however is unable to clarify. Her symptoms occurred in the 
abscence of clear orthostatsis/hypotension, however fluid may 
have been infusing during the recordings. She has a moderate 
intensity systolic murmur which augments with expiration 
suggesting a left sided lesion. Her presentation is not 
concerning for a primary neurologic event, signficant 
hemorrhage, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism or 
cardiac arrhythmia (no events on tele). The most likely 
etiologies include valvular heart lesion, autonomic dysfunction 
for DMII, orthostasis from osmotic diuresis and ACEi therapy or 
vasovagal events. Cardiac telemetry monitoring showed no events 
and EKGs were normal.  The patient had an echocardiogram which 
showed no valvular dysfunction which could lead to syncope.  The 
patient reported some stress at home at the time of these 
syncopal episodes, suggestive that her syncopal episodes may 
have been vasovagal responses. The patient was continued on her 
lisinopril since she was hemodynamically stable.

CHRONIC ISSUES
#TYPE II DIABETES: Blood glucose on addmission the ___. The 
patient denied polyuria/polydipsia at home.  The patient was 
kept on a HISS while in-house and her metformin and glimepiride

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with a PMH notable for type II diabetes and

ACTIVE ISSUES
#SYNCOPE: Recurrent over the 24 hours prior to admission. The
patient has never experienced these symptoms before. She
reported a history of a heart problem diagnosed in ___,
however is unable to clarify. Her symptoms occurred in the
abscence of clear orthostatsis/hypotension, however fluid may
have been infusing during the recordings. She has a moderate
intensity systolic murmur which augments with expiration
suggesting a left sided lesion. Her presentation is not
concerning for a primary neurologic event, signficant
hemorrhage, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism or
cardiac arrhythmia (no events on tele). The most likely
etiologies include valvular heart lesion, autonomic dysfunction
for DMII, orthostasis from osmotic diuresis and ACEi therapy or
vasovagal events. Cardiac telemetry monitoring showed no events
and EKGs were normal. The patient had an echocardiogram which
showed no valvular dysfunction which could lead to syncope. The
patient reported some stress at home at the time of these
syncopal episodes, suggestive that her syncopal episodes may
have been vasovagal responses. The patient was continued on her
lisinopril since she was hemodynamically stable.
CHRONIC ISSUES
#TYPE II DIABETES: Blood glucose on addmission the ___. The
patient denied polyuria/polydipsia at home. The patient was
kept on a HISS while in-house and her metformin and glimepiride
were continued at discharge. Repeat HbA1c was pending at time
of discharge.

ruled out for acute coronary syndrome.  He had complaint of 
substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm and neck that 
has been longstanding, with pain lasting between seconds to 
minutes and occuring and resolving spontaneously.  His cardiac 
enzymes were negative x3, ECGs throuhout his stay were normal 
with normal sinus rhythm and no ST changes.  A stress test was 
not done given low suspicion for MI (TIMI of 1). It is unlikely 
that this was a cocaine induced vasospasm given that this chest 
pain does not coincide with cocaine use and that his chest pain 
persists despite UA being negative for cocaine and last cocaine 
use 1.5 weeks ago per patient report. Patient's vitals stable 
with occasional episodes of chest pain without signifant 
findings on telemetry or EKG. Patient also had multiple ECG 
stress tests in past few years that were all negative as well.

# Scrotal pain. Patient presented with scrotal pain which has 
been evaluated previously and is likely a chronic issue.  A 
recent scrotal US was unremarkable.  Our physical exam was 
benign without any inguinal adenopathy, tenderness, discharge, 
or lesions. A follow-up appointment was arranged with his PCP to 
further evaluate this issue.  

# Asthma.  Patient has a history asthma which was not active 
during his stay.  He denied wheezing and difficulty with 
breathing related to his asthma.

sexual intercourse with a female with positive HIV six weeks 
ago. He had a negative HIV test 4 weeks ago. A hepatitis lab 
panel showed no signs of chronic hep B or hep C.  The patient 
was advised to follow-up with PCP to get repeat HIV test. 

# Lower back pain.   Patient complains of bilateral burning pain 
down the posterior leg.  This has been a chronic issue and would 
recommend f/u with PCP to further evaluate matter.

to fully dilated.  She noted some left lower quadrant pain. Her
epidural was adjusted. She then had recurrence of pain in the
left lower quadrant. She was fully dilated, at +2 to +3
station. The fetal heart rate tracing was reassuring.
However, given her pain, the decision was made to proceed
with an urgent Cesarean section as a uterine scar dehiscence
was suspected as the cause of her pain.

Intraoperatively, the patient was found to have an obviously 
ruptured bladder with foley bulb protruding throught he bladder. 
 She was also noted to have a very thin lower uterine segment.  
Infant was a liveborn girl, wt 3505 grams, with Apgars of 8 and 
9 at 1, 5 minutes respectively.  Intraoperative urology consult 
was obtained and the bladder was closed in two layers.  Please 
see operative notes by Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ 
(___) for full details.

POSTPARTUM COURSE:
The patient was kept on L&D for 6 hours postoperatively.  She 
received 500cc bolus of IVF x1 for low urine output.  She was 
transported to the postpartum floor.  Urine output was found to 
resolve.  She received 24 hours of kefzol postoperatively for 
prophlyaxis.  She was continued to be followed by urology, who 
recommended that the foley be kept in until ___ days postop, 
at which time she would follow up as an outpatient for a 
cystogram and have her foley d/c'd.  She also developed a rash 
which was thought to be intertriginous candidiasis, and for

Brief Hospital Course:
ANTEPARTUM COURSE:
The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery. She progressed
to fully dilated. She noted some left lower quadrant pain. Her
epidural was adjusted. She then had recurrence of pain in the
left lower quadrant. She was fully dilated, at +2 to +3
station. The fetal heart rate tracing was reassuring.
However, given her pain, the decision was made to proceed
with an urgent Cesarean section as a uterine scar dehiscence
was suspected as the cause of her pain.
INTRAPARTUM COURSE:
Repeat low transverse cesarean section was undertaken.
Intraoperatively, the patient was found to have an obviously
ruptured bladder with foley bulb protruding throught he bladder. She was also noted to have a very thin lower uterine segment.
Infant was a liveborn girl, wt 3505 grams, with Apgars of 8 and
9 at 1, 5 minutes respectively. Intraoperative urology consult
was obtained and the bladder was closed in two layers. Please
see operative notes by Dr. ___ and Dr. ___
(___) for full details.
POSTPARTUM COURSE:
The patient was kept on L&D for 6 hours postoperatively. She
received 500cc bolus of IVF x1 for low urine output. She was
transported to the postpartum floor. Urine output was found to
resolve. She received 24 hours of kefzol postoperatively for
prophlyaxis. She was continued to be followed by urology, who
recommended that the foley be kept in until ___ days postop,
at which time she would follow up as an outpatient for a
cystogram and have her foley d/c'd. She also developed a rash
which was thought to be intertriginous candidiasis, and for
which she was treated with topical clotrimazole. The patient
was given leg bag teaching and was discharged home in good
condition on PPD#4.

ACUTE ISSUES
#Unresponsiveness, new seizure
Patient found down with lorazepam on person. Urine and serum 
toxicology screen negative, though lorazepam and many other 
agents not screened. Initial labs demonstrated leukocytosis to 
14.5, negative UA and chest imaging not suggestive of infection. 
Other imaging including CTH and CTA which did not identify an 
intracranial process (herniation, infarction), PE, or acute 
aorta. Upon arrival to ___, patient was thought to be seizing. 
He was given a total of 4mg lorazepam and started on 
fentanyl/midazolam for sedation while intubated. An LP was 
attempted bedside but was unsuccessful. Neurology was consulted 
who recommended EEG, which was negative for seizure activity.  
The patient spontaneously emerged from unresponsiveness and 
while self extubating, injured a tooth. The patient was started 
on leviteracetam per Neurology. An MRI head was unremarkable. He 
denied any history of seizures, new medications, drug or etOH 
use, etc.

He will be discharged on keppra, and was instructed on following 
seizure precautions.  He was advised to followup for a repeat 
EEG and with neurology.  He was also told to followup with new 
PCP.

# Asymptomatic Bacteriuria:  10,000-100,000 colonies of bacteria 
seen on urine culture.  UA negative and patient asymptomatic, so 
appears to be contaminant.

# Chronic sinusitis:  Patient with symptoms, and seen on MRI.  
Advised to discuss with PCP.  

# Tooth injury:  Has loose tooth on account of self-extubation.  
Given limited number of percocets for his pain, and the number 
for ___ to arrange followup.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___ The patient presented at 35 weeks and 4 days with 
elevated blood pressures as high as 180/100.  She also 
complained of mild cramping that progressively worsened to 
severe over the course of her evaluation for preeclampsia. A 
transabdominal ultrasound done for fetal well-being revealed a 
concealed large placental abruption. Given her symptoms and 
abruption, the decision was made to proceed with an urgent 
cesarean section under general endotracheal anesthesia. Her 
cesearean section was uncomplicated and the abruption was noted 
on gross observation. The placenta was sent to pathology and the 
pathology confirmed acute abruption. The Ph of the venous blood 
gas was 7.30 but the arterial blood gas sent to the lab was 
clotted and therefore not evaluated. 
Although she had >600 protein in her u/a, her urine protein was 
<6 on ___. All other pre-eclampsia/HEELP labs were within normal 
limits. The decision was made by the attending physican not to 
proceed with magnesium given unclear diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. 

Her postoperative course was complicated only by elevated blood 
pressures as high as 160/90. She was started on Labetalol 200 
BID which was titrated up to 300 BID. On ___, at discharge, 
her blood pressures were well controlled, she had no symptoms of 
pre-eclampsia and she met all postoperative goals.
*
Ms ___ was readmitted on ___ with BP 160s/110s with HA, 
and new mild transaminitis with an ALT of 46. Her Pr: Cr ratio 
was now 0.4. She received 24 of Magnesium (a 4g bolus and a 
2g/hr infusion). She was started on Nifedipine 10 mg TID which 
immediately brought her blood pressures to within normal range. 
Her headache resolved with Tylenol and sleep. She was discharged 
home on hospital day 3 on Nifedipine with well controlled blood 
pressures and no symptoms of pre-eclampsia.
