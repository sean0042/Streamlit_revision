1,2,18167383,What changes were made to the patient's pre-admission medication list between her first admission on 2190-01-18 and her second on 2191-09-24?,Rosuvastatin Calcium 50mg PO HS was changed to Rosuvastatin Calcium 500mg PO Q48H,Losartan Potassium 50 mg PO DAILY was replaced with Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID,The patient was newly prescribed Mobic 7.5 mg oral daily,Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazide 1 CAP PO DAILY was discontinued and replaced with Meloxicam 7.5 mg oral daily,The dosage of Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazide 1 CAP PO DAILY was changed to twice daily,C,"Between the first and second admission, the patient was prescribed a new drug, Mobic (meloxicam) 7.5 mg oral daily which was not on her medication list during the first admission, making option C the correct answer. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect but they are believable distractors given that they reflect medications that the patient was on during either the first or second admission. Specifically: Option A is incorrect because although the patient was taking Rosuvastatin Calcium during both admissions, the dosage remained the same. It remained 50 mg. Option B is incorrect because Losartan Potassium was not replaced with Docusate Sodium but rather, the potassium dosage was increased. Option D is misleading because Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazide was not discontinued or replaced with Meloxicam, it continued to stay in the prescription. Option E is not correct because the dosage for Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazide remained once daily and was not changed to twice daily."
2,2,19152692,What was the most recent significant medical event and treatment the patient experienced?,Patient was diagnosed with pregnancy at 28+1 weeks and advised bed rest.,The patient had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat acute cholecystitis.,"The patient was found to have a short cervix, but no treatment was provided.",The patient was admitted due to the recurrence of posterior fibroid.,Patient was given prenatal vitamins as medication for abdominal pain.,B,"According to the patient's second chart, the most recent significant medical event was an acute cholecystitis, for which the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The other options are either events from the past or gastrointestinal conditions that were not recently treated.   Option A is incorrect, as the patient's pregnancy was recorded earlier than the surgery for acute cholecystitis. Option C is also wrong because though the patient has a short cervix, the significant event recently was the surgery. Option D is not correct as there was no recent admission due to the recurrence of posterior fibroid. Option E is incorrect as prenatal vitamins were not used to treat the abdominal pain."
3,2,16997420,What were the next steps decided after the patient's first hospital visit due to a left calcaneal fracture and who was supposed to be involved in the further treatment planning?,The patient was advised to continue taking prescribed oral medications and take care of their wound. Further treatment was to be carried out by the orthopedics team.,The patient was to follow up with Dr. ___ of the Foot and Ankle Service for further evaluation and surgical treatment planning.,"The patient was recommended to undergo physical therapy for non-weight bearing in the left lower extremity, and further treatment was supposed to be managed under a general physician's observation.",The patient was discharged on two main oral medications and was referred to a neurologist for further examination and long term treatment.,"The patient was required to maintain a healthy diet and follow moderate exercise routine. And, a general physician was supposed to oversee the future medical consultations.",B,"After the patient's first hospital visit due to a left calcaneal fracture, the next step decided was to follow up with Dr. ___ of the Foot and Ankle Service. This is discussed in detail in the 'Brief Hospital Course' section of 'note 1'. Hence, option B is correct.   Option A, while noting the patient's discharge instructions, does not include reference to the Foot and Ankle Service and is also mentioned in note 1, but doesn't answer the complete question. Option C talks about physical therapy, which is in the discharge instructions but doesn't align with the idea about 'who' will be involved in the treatment planning. Option D is incorrect as it mainly focuses on medication and refers to a neurologist, which is not mentioned in the discharge summary. Option E is incorrect as it talks about non-medical intervention and overall reduction of risk factors, which isn’t targeted to the specific issue."
4,2,12981450,What were the different pain medications prescribed to the patient during the course of his hospital visits and how did the prescription regimen change over time?,"The patient was initially prescribed morphine and aspirin, but was later transitioned to oxycodone and aspirin.","The patient was initially prescribed acetaminophen and dilaudid, but was later transitioned to morphine and aspirin.","The patient was initially prescribed oxycodone and morphine, but was later transitioned to acetaminophen and dilaudid.","The patient was initially prescribed aspirin and dilaudid, but later these were shifted to oxycodone and morphine.","The patient was initially prescribed aspirin and dilaudid, but was later transitioned to acetaminophen and morphine.",C,"The correct answer is C because, according to the discharge summaries, the patient was initially on oxycodone and morphine for pain management. However, at discharge, the patient was prescribed acetaminophen and dilaudid. The other options, A, B, D, and E, while using medications that are mentioned in the patient's summaries, do not accurately reflect the changes in the patient's pain management protocol over time."
5,2,13208323,What were the major surgical procedures the patient underwent during her admissions on 2140-11-15 and 2144-09-23 respectively?,Laparoscopic surgery and Bilateral Tubal Ligation on 2140-11-15 and Tubal Ligation and Endometrial Ablation on 2144-09-23.,"Exploratory Laparotomy, Abdominal Myomectomy and Bilateral Tubal Ligation on 2140-11-15 and Subtotal Hysterectomy and Uterine Fibroid Embolization on 2144-09-23.","Exploratory Laparotomy, Abdominal Myomectomy and Bilateral Tubal Ligation on 2140-11-15, and Total Abdominal Hysterectomy and Left Salpingectomy on 2144-09-23.","ERCP and Bilateral Tubal Ligation on 2140-11-15, and Ovarian Cyst Removal and Tubal Ligation on 2144-09-23.","Removal and Insertion of IUD on 2140-11-15, and Ablation and Dilatation and Curettage on 2144-09-23.",C,"The correct surgical procedures undergone by the patient during her admissions on 2140-11-15 and 2144-09-23 are respectively Exploratory Laparotomy, Abdominal Myomectomy, and Bilateral Tubal Ligation, and Total Abdominal Hysterectomy and Left Salpingectomy. The other options (A, B, D, E) are incorrect because they either list surgeries not performed on the specified dates according to the notes, or include procedures (like ERCP, Ovarian Cyst Removal,Subtotal Hysterectomy,Uterine Fibroid Embolization, Removal and Insertion of IUD, Ablation and Dilatation and Curettage) that were not part of the patient's surgical history."
6,2,14950683,"Did the patient suffering with dizziness and osteoarthritis, undergone any surgical treatment at the time of hospitalization that led to hip fracture due to the fall?",The patient was diagnosed with bladder cancer and required a retropubic radical prostatectomy.,The patient went through a subtotal colectomy to treat colon cancer.,"No surgical procedure was performed when the patient was admitted due to dizziness and a fall, but the patient did have a prior prostatectomy.",The patient received a surgery to improve his cervical spondylosis.,The patient went through lumbar laminectomy treatment to manage his lumbar stenosis.,C,"The patient had a retropubic radical prostatectomy, but this procedure was completed before the hospitalization episode in which the patient suffered a hip fracture due to a fall. There is no specific surgical treatment that caused the patient's hip fracture during the mentioned admission identified in the provided notes. It was rather due to dizziness and a fall. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they mention surgical treatments that took place at different points of time and are unrelated to the patient's hip fracture."
7,2,17430600,What is the patient's obstetric history and how has it influenced the management of her current pregnancy?,The patient has a past history of multiple pregnancies with no complications or need for special management.,The patient has had two previous births; one cesarean section for twins due to severe preeclampsia and a successful VBAC. Her chronic hypertension has been managed with metoprolol.,"The patient has no past history of pregnancies, making this her first child.",The patient has a history of delivering full term with no assistance or medical intervention necessary.,The patient has undergone a successful VBAC due to issues of hypertension but has no history of other pregnancies.,B,"This answer is correct because the patient has had two pregnancies before; the first pregnancy involved a cesarean section due to severe preeclampsia and the delivery of twins while the second birth was a successful vaginal birth after cesarean(VBAC). In the current pregnancy, her chronic hypertension was medicated with metoprolol and her premature contractions were managed without tocolytics. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect. Option A does not align with the patient's history of severe preeclampsia and cesarean section. Option C is also incorrect because the patient has a clear history of two births before this pregnancy. Option D neglects the patient's history of cesarean section and severe preeclampsia. Option E incorrectly states the patient has no history of other pregnancies. All incorrect options lack the complexity and accuracy of the patient's obstetric history and its influence on her current pregnancy."
8,2,13074106,What was the patient's infection history prior to this hospital visit as documented in prior discharge summary and what was the resultant medical action taken?,The patient had a history of malaria but no medication was prescribed.,The patient had suffered from anemia and was given iron supplements.,The patient had gonorrhea in the past which had been treated prior to her current pregnancy.,"The patient had a history of hepatitis, and was undergoing a course of antivirals.",The individual had previously battled chlamydia and was subsequently prescribed antibiotics.,C,"The patient's discharge summary notes a history of gonorrhea. However, it does mention that this was prior to her current pregnancy, implicitly indicating that it was treated given the lack of any further mention in subsequent notes. Option A deceptionally refers to malaria, which was not indicated in her medical record. Option B discusses anemia and iron supplementation; while the patient's hemoglobin was low, she was not diagnosed with anemia or prescribed iron supplements. Option D mentions hepatitis and antivirals, but the patient's notes make no mention of this illness or treatment response. Lastly, option E implies that the patient had chlamydia and was administered antibiotics; although she did have chlamydia in her history, the record does not specify that antibiotics were given as a result of this infection."
9,2,15496014,What new medication was added after the patient's hospital attendance for uterine artery embolization on 2155-07-08 related to her uterine fibroids and anemia?,Acetaminophen 1000 mg,Tranexamic Acid Oral Solution 1300 mg,Levonorgestrel 20 mcg/24 hr,Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg,Lorazepam 0.5 mg,D,"The correct answer is D: Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg. This medication was added after the patient's hospital attendance and is produced in note 2 under the ""Discharge Medications,"" while this medication is not listed under the admission medications, indicating that it was introduced during the hospital stay.  Option A: Acetaminophen 1000 mg is not the correct answer because it was listed under the patient's discharge medications in both note 1 and note 2. This indicates that the patient was already on this medication before her attendance for uterine artery embolization.   Option B: Tranexamic Acid Oral Solution 1300 mg is not the correct answer because the medication was listed under the preadmission Medication list and was to be held at discharge.  Option C: Levonorgestrel 20 mcg/24 hr is not correct because, although it is found under the discharge medications in note 1, it is not listed under the medications in note 2, and thus was not added after the specific hospital attendance.  Option E: Lorazepam 0.5 mg is also not correct. While it was part of the patient's Discharge Medications, this medication was also listed under Medications on Admission, indicating it was not new to the patient."
10,2,19904022,What is the patient's sensitivities or allergies as mentioned in the discharge summary?,The patient has a sensitivity to antibiotics.,The patient has an allergy to latex.,The patient is allergic to nuts.,The patient has an allergy to pain medications.,The patient has a sensitivity to dairy products.,C,"The discharge summary mentions ""Nut Flavor"" in the Allergies section, indicating that the patient is allergic to nuts. Answer Choices A, B, D, and E, though containing contents that are present in the summary, are incorrect as there is no explicit mention of these specific allergies in the text. Distractors were chosen with a focus on common allergies in a clinical setting to ensure they would be plausible but incorrect according to the provided text."
11,2,18851841,What was the surgical procedure performed on the patient on his first hospital visit and was there any complications observed during his hospital stay?,The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.,The patient underwent greenlight vaporization of the prostate without any complications reported.,The patient was treated for small-bowel obstruction with closed loop obstruction secondary to adhesions.,The patient was subjected to a treatment procedure for BPH during his stay.,The patient required a procedure to untwist the bowel.,B,"The passage reveals from the first hospital visit's discharge summary that the patient underwent greenlight vaporization of the prostate (PVP). There were no complications during or post-operation, and the patient's recovery was smooth as per the records. Option A refers to the patient's second hospital visit procedure, making it incorrect. Option C is the diagnosis made during the second visit, not the surgical procedure. Option D makes a vague reference to BPH, but it does not specify the surgical procedure performed. Option E is part of the procedure performed during the second hospital stay, making it false in the context of the first visit. So, from the provided question, Option B is the correct answer."
12,2,16250146,What was the patient initially diagnosed with during her first hospital visit in 2170 and what treatment was given?,The patient was diagnosed with a vallecular cyst and treated with the excision of the cyst.,The patient was diagnosed with gestational diabetes but no treatment was mentioned.,"The patient was diagnosed with sore throat and hoarseness, then treated with Decadron, clindamycin IV, and an oral Medrol dose pack.","The patient was diagnosed with Microcytic Anemia, and treatment was not indicated.",The patient was diagnosed with voice change and put on a strict diet.,C,"The discharge summary note dated 2170-01-15 refers to the patient's hospitalization. Here, it is indicated that the female patient had a sore throat and hoarseness. Her treatment included Decadron 10mg IV, IV clindamycin, which was later converted to a 10-day oral course, and a Medrol dose pack. Hence, the right answer is choice C.   The distractors include A and E, which incorrectly identify the diagnosis or the event timeline. Choice B and D are incorrect as gestational diabetes and microcytic anemia were part of the patient's medical history, but not the core reason for her hospitalization during this period."
13,2,19779908,What was the surgical history of the patient discussed in the summary charted on 2131-09-02 and what was her subsequent diagnosis made during her visit in October 2131?,The patient had never undergone surgery before and was diagnosed with right-sided hyperparathyroidism in October 2131.,The patient underwent a right-sided parathyroid gland removal in September and was diagnosed with a left femoral stress fracture in October.,The patient was status post total thyroidectomy in September and was diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism following the total thyroidectomy in October.,The patient underwent a thyroidectomy in September and was diagnosed with right physical extremity paresthesia in October.,The patient had a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in September and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in October.,B,"The discharge summary from September shows that the patient had a surgical history of a right-sided parathyroid gland removal. In the notes from October, it was mentioned that the patient was diagnosed with a left femoral stress fracture. Choice A is incorrect as the patient did have a surgery before, as mentioned in the September note. C is incorrect because the patient was not status post total thyroidectomy in September. D is incorrect as the patient did not undergo a thyroidectomy in September or was diagnosed with right physical extremity paresthesia in October. Choice E is incorrect as the patient didn't undergo a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in September nor was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in October."
14,2,16738783,"What was the major surgical procedure undertaken during the patient's second visit, and what was the outcome?","Bowel resection was done, and she was able to tolerate a regular diet post-operation.","Treatment for her disc herniation was done, and she was discharged to home with medications.","Adhesions were lysed, and post-surgery she tolerated a regular diet and was discharged.","Surgery for magnesia sulphate heptahydrate was done, and her diet was advanced to clears.","Appendectomy was performed, and her pain was well controlled on an oral regimen.",C,"C is the correct answer as it is mentioned in the second note that the major surgical procedure was 'Lysis of adhesions' and the patient was able to tolerate a regular diet post-surgery and was discharged. This information is in alignment with the doctor's question. Other options like A, B, D, and E, although contain details drawn from the patient's notes, are incorrect as none of these procedures were performed during the patient's second visit, nor did these events form the outcome of any surgical procedure performed during that visit. Thus, they serve as good distractors."
15,2,15147004,What were the complications that necessitated the patient's second admission to the hospital?,Onset of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection.,Occurrence of intense abdominal pain and ileus.,Complications linked to the administration of hydrocodone-acetaminophen.,Acute penicillin allergy reaction.,Development of a bladder tumor.,B,"The patient was re-admitted to the hospital due to 'abdominal pain and ileus' as recorded in the case notes. A 'likely ileus' and 'abdominal pain' were the primary reasons for the second admission (note 2). The other options are incorrect but good distractors: 'onset of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection' doesn't appear in the note, hence is incorrect; 'complications linked to the administration of hydrocodone-acetaminophen' is incorrect because the patient was tolerant to this medication (note 1); 'acute penicillin allergy reaction' is incorrect as there's no record of penicillin allergy symptoms, though the patient has a known penicillin allergy; and 'development of a bladder tumor' did necessitate the first hospitalization (note 1), but not the second one (note 2), hence is incorrect."
16,2,14790504,What surgical procedure did the patient undergo during his second admission which was done to address the issue of knee stiffness from the prior compartment syndrome? ,The patient underwent a compartment release procedure with a VAC placement.,He underwent a process called I&D and fasciotomy closure in his left thigh.,His procedure involved I&D treatment with VAC change.,He was treated with a quadricepsplasty in his left femur.,The patient was given a cardiac rhythm adjustment procedure.,D,"The question asks for the procedure the patient underwent during his second visit to address knee stiffness following a prior compartment syndrome. It corresponds to Note 2, where it is documented that he underwent a left femur quadricepsplasty because of progressive knee stiffness after prior compartment syndrome. Answer choice D aligns with this information. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect; although they are procedures undertaken by the patient, they took place during the first hospital admission, and they do not concern the knee stiffness. Finally, option E is incorrect as it is unrelated to the knee issue or the patient's surgical history. Instead, it pertains to a general observation made in both visits' physical examinations."
17,2,15193493,"What was the main reason for the patient's readmission to the hospital post discharge as per the summary on 2116-08-03, and what was the major surgical procedure performed during this visit?",The patient readmitted due to abdominal cramping and pains related to her previous pregnancy.,The patient was readmitted due to mental health concerns and needed immediate support.,The patient was treated for her infection via 48 hours of antibiotics and had the procedure of dilation and curettage due to endometritis.,"The patient's readmission was due to cystic hygroma, which was managed through a series of medications.",The patient was readmitted due to complaints about her abdominal pain and was treated exclusively with medications.,C,"Choice C is the correct answer as it correctly identifies the reason for readmission as endometritis(an infection after D&E for IUFD) and indicates the major surgical procedure that was performed during this visit which was the dilation and curettage. The other options, while containing details from the patient's discharge summary, are incorrect because either the reason for readmission is incorrect (Choices A, B, D, E) or the surgical procedure mentioned is incorrect (Choices B, D, E). Choice A and E are plausible distractors since abdominal cramping is mentioned in the discharge summary but it was not the primary cause of readmission. Choice B is an incorrect distractor as there's no evidence in the discharge summary to support mental health concerns as the cause for readmission. Choice D is also incorrect, while cystic hygroma was mentioned in the discharge summary, it was not the primary reason for readmission post discharge."
18,2,19163567,"What was the cause of the left hand pain and swelling for the patient during his subsequent visit in November 2159, and what major surgical or invasive procedure did the patient undergo due to this?",The patient's left hand pain and swelling was caused by MRSA infection and he underwent a I&D L flexor tenosynovitis procedure.,"The patient's left hand pain and swelling was related to a blister he developed while doing pull-ups, leading him to undergo a procedure related to his left upper extremity.","The patient's left hand pain and swelling was due to his left hand abscess formed after he injected cocaine into his hand, resulting in a L dorsal hand abscess I&D procedure.","The patient's left hand pain and swelling was due to his erythema and edema, leading him to undergo a procedure that required sutures.","The patient's left hand pain and swelling were due to MSSA, and he underwent a procedure related to a right leg I & D.",C,"From note 2, the patient was reported to have injected cocaine into his left hand, which led to hand pain and swelling. The procedure referenced was the L dorsal hand abscess incision and drainage (I&D). Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because these events and procedures are either related to the patient's earlier condition as per note 1 (MRSA infection and left flexor tenosynovitis I&D, development of a blister from pull-ups, or MSSA), or are misinterpretations of note 2 (erythema and edema, sutures, right leg I & D, abscess on the right arm)."
19,2,18916540,"What was the primary discharge diagnosis for the patient during her second admission, and what was the treatment approach used during the hospital stay?","Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, treated with laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophrectomy.","Asthma exacerbation and upper respiratory tract infection, managed with steroids and nebulizers.","Diabetic patient experiencing pain, controlled with IV dilaudid/toradol given after laparoscopic surgery.","Asthma exacerbation and upper respiratory tract infection, managed with antibiotics and administration of IV fluids.","Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, treated by adjusting diet and prescribing post-operative pain medications.",B,"From note 2, it is clear that the patient during her second admission was primarily diagnosed with an acute asthma exacerbation and an upper respiratory tract infection. The treatment approach used during the hospital stay was management with steroids and nebulizers.  Option A is incorrect because it details the primary discharge diagnosis and treatment approach from the first admission, not the second.  Option C is inappropriate because it focuses on diabetic symptoms and the associated treatment which is not mentioned in the discharge summary. Option D is incorrect because, although it refers to the second admission, it incorrectly states the treatment, which was management with steroids and nebulizers, not antibiotics and IV fluids. Option E is also incorrect because it refers to the first admission, not the second. The details of the treatment are incorrect as it does not include the surgical intervention that was conducted."
20,2,10836581,"What medical procedures were performed on the patient's right vs. left leg, and when?","The patient underwent knee surgery on her left leg, unspecified date.","The patient underwent internal fixation of right tibial fracture and internal fixation of left fibula fracture, unspecified date.","The patient had surgical removal of left ankle hardware, unspecified date.","The patient underwent open reduction of ankle dislocation on her right leg, unspecified date.","The patient underwent tibial fracture stabilization in her left leg, unspecified date.",B,"Based on the information given in the discharge summary, the patient had undergone open reduction internal fixation of right and left tibial fractures and open reduction internal fixation of left fibula fracture. Though the exact date is not stipulated in the discharge summary, option B correctly details the procedures performed on both legs. Option A, C, D and E are incorrect as they mention procedures that were not performed according to the discharge summary. While knee surgery was previously carried out, it is not mentioned if it was on the left or right leg. The removal of left ankle hardware was done at a later date and is not the primary procedure in discussion. The correction of an ankle dislocation and tibial fracture stabilization are not stipulated in the discharge summary. These distractors highlight different elements from the patient's medical history and current treatment but do not accurately answer the question."
21,2,18857008,"What was the primary reason for the patient's two hospital admissions, and what treatments were administered during these visits?",The patient was admitted for a subchorionic hematoma and received prophylactic Rhogam during both visits.,"The patient was admitted for preterm contractions for both visits. During the first admission, the patient received betamethasone and nifedipine, and during her second admission, she underwent elective cesarean delivery and got treated for influenza with Tamiflu. ",The patient was admitted due to rheumatoid arthritis and was treated with sulfasalazine.,"The patient was admitted due to complaints of sore throat and fatigue, she was treated with IV hydration.",The patient was admitted due to persistent contractions and was treated with nifedipine during both hospitalizations.,B,"The correct answer is B because, according to the discharge summaries, the patient was indeed admitted twice due to preterm labor (contractions). During the first admission she received betamethasone and nifedipine, and during the second admission, she underwent a cesarean section and was treated for influenza with Tamiflu.   Option A is incorrect though parts of it are factual. The patient did have a subchorionic hematoma and did receive Rhogam, but neither of these were the primary reason for the admissions.  Option C is incorrect. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, but this was not the cause of the two hospital admissions.  Option D is incorrect. While the patient did report feeling fatigued and having a sore throat during the first hospital admission, these were symptoms rather than the main cause for admission. In addition, the patient was treated with IV hydration but it was not the primary treatment.  Option E is incorrect. While nifedipine was used to treat the patient’s preterm contractions during the first hospital visit, it was not used in the second visit. Instead, she had a cesarean section during her second admission."
22,2,13799578,What measures were taken during the patient's second visit to manage the repeated episodes of nausea and vomiting and were they successful?,The patient was provided painkillers to manage the discomfort.,The patient underwent surgery to manage persistent nausea.,"The patient was given IV hydration and IV antiemetics. As her condition improved, she was switched to oral medications with no episode of vomiting reported subsequently.",The patient was put on a special diet to manage the vomiting.,The patient was asked to increase her physical activity to manage the nausea.,C,"The notes from the second visit reveal that the patient was provided with IVF hydration and IV antiemetics to manage her nausea and vomiting. Her symptoms improved after using a Scopolamine patch, and she was switched to oral medications from IV meds. It is later noted that the patient did not throw up overnight, indicating that the measures taken were successful. Options A, B, D, and E are distractors that, while containing elements from the patient's notes, are obviously not the correct interventions used to manage the patient's condition."
23,2,18701903,What were the final discharge medications given to the patient after her second visit on 2171-08-28?,"Acetaminophen 325 mg, Enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL, Docusate Sodium 100 mg, Levothyroxine 50 mcg, and Hydromorphone 2 mg.","Levothyroxine, Dilaudid, and Colace.","Enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL, Levothyroxine 50 mcg, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, and Senokot-S 8.6-50 mg.","Enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL, Levothyroxine, and Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen.","Acetaminophen 325 mg, Docusate Sodium 100mg, and Levothyroxine 50 mcg.",C,"According to the patient's second visit on 2171-08-28 in note 2, the final discharge medications given to the patient were Enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL, Levothyroxine 50 mcg, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, and Senokot-S 8.6-50 mg.  Option A includes medications that were given to the patient during her first visit but not the second.  Option B is incorrect because Dilaudid and Colace are not listed in the discharge medications after her second visit.  Option D is incorrect as it does not include Senokot-S 8.6-50 mg which was prescribed on discharge.  Option E is incorrect because it lists medications from the first visit's discharge that are not included in the second visit's discharge."
24,2,10044439,What were the key findings of the ultrasound reports during the patient's successive admissions for preterm labor and placental abruption in 2172 and preterm contractions in 2175?,The ultrasound reports showed a long cervix and heavy bleeding.,The ultrasound reports showed evidence of placental abruption and a short cervix.,The ultrasound reports indicated harmonious fetal development and normal fluid levels.,The ultrasound reports showed a decrease in the size of the patient's subchorionic hematoma.,The ultrasound reports showed normal cervical length and no evidence of placental abruption.,E,"The ultrasound reports during the patient's 2175 admission showed a normal cervical length of 3.4 cm, and there was no evidence of placental abruption. Option A is incorrect; the reports did not indicate a long cervix or heavy bleeding. Option B is also incorrect; although the patient was admitted for preterm labor and placental abruption in 2172, the documentation does not provide details of ultrasound findings from that admission. Option C is incorrect; the reports did not explicitly state harmonious fetal development. Lastly, option D is incorrect; the size of the patient's subchorionic hematoma was not mentioned in any ultrasound reports."
25,2,16128726,What was the primary treatment administered during both of the patient's hospital admissions and what was the primary reason cited for its administration?,The patient was administered Intravenous Fluids (IVF) to rehydrate due to diarrhea.,The patient was given ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to treat the inflammation and-infection caused by ruptured appendicitis and cecal diverticulitis during both hospital admissions.,Patient was given contrast dye in spite of allergies to assist with visual imaging.,The patient was given a normal diet in restore his strength and health.,The patient was provided pain medication to manage abdominal pain.,B,"The correct answer is B as it is clear from both admissions that ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were the primary treatments given. They were administered for the treatment of inflammation and infection caused due to ruptured appendicitis and possible cecal diverticulitis. Option A is incorrect although IV fluids would likely have been administered, it not stated in the notes as the primary treatment, Options C, D and E, although actions and treatments noted in the documents, they are not the primary treatment for both hospital admissions."
26,2,10553248,What was the first surgical procedure performed to alleviate the patient's obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms and when was it performed?,The patient underwent radiofrequency ablation of his right kidney in 2184.,The patient received prostate-specific hormone therapy at an unspecified date.,The patient underwent a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate operation in 2184.,The patient underwent a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate operation in 2185.,The patient had radiation therapy for his prostate cancer at an unknown date.,C,"The discharge summary from 2184 mentions that the patient was admitted to the Urology service after undergoing a TURP for obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms. This implies that it was the first surgical procedure performed to alleviate these symptoms.  Option A is incorrect because the radiofrequency ablation was for kidney cancer, not lower urinary tract symptoms. Option B is incorrect as hormone therapy is not a surgical procedure. Option D is incorrect as it refers to a complete TURP performed in 2185, not the initial procedure. Option E is incorrect as radiation therapy is not a surgical procedure and the date is not specified."
27,2,12024158,What changes were made to the patient's pain management regimen between the discharge summaries charted on 2137-12-11 and 2137-12-13?,The patient was started taking dilaudid and celebrex post-discharge.,Ibuprofen was discontinued in the patient's pain management regimen.,The patient was prescribed morphine and stopped taking dilaudid upon discharge.,Gabapentin was removed from the patient's medication list post-discharge.,The patient was put on celebrex at home post-discharge.,C,"According to the discharge summary charted on 2137-12-11, the patient's pain regimen included dilaudid as the primary opioid drug for analgesia. However, in the discharge summary of 2137-12-13, the patient was prescribed morphine and dilaudid was discontinued, satisfying the requirements for the correct answer.  Moving on to the other answer choices: Option A is incorrect, as dilaudid and celebrex were included in the patient's pain regimen on 2137-12-11 as well, and did not only start post-discharge. Option B is incorrect because there is no mention of Ibuprofen being discontinued in the discharge summary charted on 2137-12-13, and it was only added at this time. Option D is incorrect as gabapentin was included in both of the patient's pain management regimens before and after. Option E is incorrect, as celebrex was already a part of the pain management regimen from the beginning, and not only started after discharge."
28,2,14267655,What was the patient's chief complaints and major surgical or invasive procedures carried out during his admissions in 2167 and 2176?,"In 2167, the chief complaint was severe lower back pain and an extensive spinal surgery was carried out. In 2176, the chief complaint was chest pain and a heart surgery was performed.","Saline injection into his veins was carried out in 2167 due to his complaint of dehydration. In 2176, the patient got a pacemaker placement following a complaint of irregular heartbeat.","His chief complaints were erectile dysfunction in both 2167 and 2176. In the former year, he underwent an Implantation of Penile Prosthesis while in the latter the procedure was Removal and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis.","The patient underwent an eye surgery in 2167 following a complaint of cataract. In 2176, he got a knee replacement procedure due to severe knee pain.",He was diagnosed with Diabetes in 2167 and a regular insulin therapy was started. In 2176 he had appendectomy following a complaint of severe abdominal pain.,C,"According to the notes, the patient's chief complaints during the two mentioned years were both Erectile Dysfunction. The major procedures were Implantation of Penile Prosthesis in 2167 and Removal and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis in 2176. The other options are incorrect as they do not reflect the information given in the patient notes, but they are plausible as they represent other potential health complaints and procedures that could happen during hospital admissions."
29,2,16366321,What was the initial reason of the patient's second hospital admission and what was the resulted surgical intervention done in this admission?,The patient was admitted due to preeclampsia evaluation and no surgical intervention was conducted during this admisssion.,The patient was admitted for elevated blood pressure and headache given her pregnancy and the surgical intervention carried out was a low transverse cesarean section.,"The patient was admitted due to persistent headache, and she underwent a surgery to treat preeclampsia.",The patient was admitted for labor pains and given a Cesarean section surgery as part of the birth process.,The patient was admitted for elevated blood pressure during pregnancy and she underwent a surgery to relief her headache.,B,"The patient's second hospital admission was mainly due to persistent headache and high blood pressure while she was 37 weeks pregnant as per note 2. Eventually, the patient had an arrested dilation in labor and a low transverse cesarean section was performed. Option A refers to the first hospital admission and states incorrectly no surgical intervention. Option C incorrect because there is no surgical procedure mentioned specifically to treat preeclampsia. Option D is a distractor as the admission was not for labor pains but for symptoms of preeclampsia. While the patient did have a C-section, it was due to arrested dilation in labor, not as part of regular birth process. Option E is not correct as the surgical intervention was not to relieve her headache."
30,2,17086459,"What was the primary reason for the patient's subsequent admission after her delivery, as per the report of 2183-06-17?",The patient was re-admitted due to severe pelvic pain.,The patient had to be admitted due to complications during her vaginal delivery.,The patient was brought in due to an acute case of pyelonephritis.,The patient was admitted because of the separation of her pubic symphysis.,The patient had complications with her pain management regimen and was thus admitted.,C,"The document dated 2183-06-17 indicates that the patient had to be re-admitted due to an acute case of pyelonephritis. The other options are incorrect as they either pertain to the problems she had during her previous admission (options A, B, and D) or are unrelated to the primary reason for her successive admission (option E). While all of these issues appear in the provided discharge summaries, they are not the main cause of her subsequent admission as per the report from 2183-06-17."
31,2,10422574,What were the changes in the patient's discharge medications between the hospitalization on 2181-11-23 and the one later on 2182-02-14?,The patient was prescribed Macrobid instead of Acetaminophen.,Nifedipine was discontinued from the patient's medications.,"Levothyroxine Sodium was discontinued, and Tamsulosin was added to the medication list.",Tamsulosin was added to the patient's medication list.,The patient stopped taking prenatal vitamins.,D,"The correct answer is D (Tamsulosin was added to the patient's medication list). In the discharge summary for 2181-11-23, the patient was prescribed Acetaminophen, Nifedipine, Nitrofurantoin, and Prenatal Vitamins. However, in the summary for 2182-02-14, the patient was prescribed Tamsulosin, Levothyroxine, and Prenatal Vitamins. Therefore, the change in medications between the two hospitalizations is that Tamsulosin was added, implying that option D is correct. Other options are incorrect: Macrobid (A) was not mentioned in the discharge medications of either summary; Nifedipine (B) was given during the first hospitalization, but it wasn't mentioned in the second hospitalization discharge medicines. The discontinuation of Nifedipine is not the only change in medications as Tamsulosin was added; Levothyroxine Sodium (C) was not discontinued, but added; Prenatal vitamins (E) is incorrect as they remained constant in both instances."
32,2,18804138,What surgical procedures were conducted on the patient during his second admission and were there any complications during his stay?,Index and long finger skin graft revisions were performed. The patient experienced numerous health issues during his hospitalization.,"Debridement, full-thickness skin, tendon right index, and long fingers were treated. There were no complications during the stay.","The patient underwent Debridement right index and long fingers, free vascularized temporal parietal flap transfer to right hand, neuroplasty right long finger, split-thickness skin graft to right hand (plantar surface of foot donor site), and application short-leg splint. There were no complications during his stay.","The patient had an open reduction, pinning, and full-thickness skin-grafting. There were numerous complications during his stay.",The patient underwent a temporal-parietal fascial flap revision/STSG. He experienced several complications during the stay.,C,"The correct answer is choice C as it outlines all the surgical procedures conducted on the patient during his second admission, as described in the second note. These procedures include Debridement right index and long fingers, Free vascularized temporal parietal flap transfer to right hand, Neuroplasty right long finger, Split-thickness skin graft to right hand, and application short-leg splint. Moreover, the note indicates that the patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications during his stay. Choices A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they do not accurately depict all the surgical procedures performed on the patient, and they include complications during the patient's stay, which, according to the medical notes, did not occur."
33,2,12221311,What was the method of delivery for the patient's twin babies and what complications led to that decision?,The baby twins were delivered by natural birth due to the patient's cervix shortening condition.,The twins were delivered by C-section due to the patient's increased hypertension.,The twins were delivered via emergency C-section due to the mother's allergic reaction to some medications.,The newborns were delivered through a primary incision due to the mother's gestational diabetes.,Induced labor was performed for the delivery due to the mother's hypothyroidism.,B,"The patient's escalating blood pressure that isn't responsive to anti-hypertensive medication at term initiated the decision to conduct a C-section for the birth of the twins. Option A is incorrect as while the patient did have cervical shortening, the summary doesn't mention it being the reason for a C-section. Option C is also incorrect as there's no mention of an allergy causing complications in delivery. Option D and E are incorrect as the document doesn't specify gestational diabetes or hypothyroidism being the reason behind the chosen delivery method."
34,2,15136489,"What surgical procedure was performed on the patient during his first hospital visit, and what major symptoms or complications did the patient experience during his recovery prior to discharge?",Patient underwent an incision and drainage surgery and experienced symptoms of fever and pain.,Patient underwent a renal transplant and experienced complications of elevated creatinine levels.,Patient underwent a donor nephrectomy and experienced complications including a fever and symptoms of ileus such as abdominal fullness.,Patient underwent an appendectomy and experienced symptoms of nausea and vomiting.,Patient received a pacemaker implantation and experienced symptoms of chest pain and discomfort.,C,"Based on the discharge summary, the patient underwent a donor nephrectomy (a surgical kidney removal procedure). During his recovery, the patient had a fever and exhibited symptoms of ileus, which is a condition involving interruption of the intestines. Answer C accurately matches this information. Answers A, B, D, and E mention other types of surgical procedures and complications that were not reported in the summary. However, they present distractors since those procedures and complications could be associated with other patients' hospital visits and procedures not relevant to this specific patient's case."
35,2,11676064,What was the discharge medication provided to the patient after her first visit to the hospital and why?,Acetaminophen for abdominal pain,Amlodipine for blood pressure control,Fluticasone Propionate for nasal issues,"Meclizine, Colace, oxycodone, and acetaminophen for managing post-surgery symptoms",Albuterol Inhaler for asthma,D,"The patient was discharged after the removal of substernal goiter (a surgery). The four medications mentioned in choice D were prescribed for her postoperative recovery. Meclizine is an antihistamine that reduces feelings of nausea, hence it's used to manage the patient's intermittent postoperative nausea. Colace is a stool softener that was recommended to counteract constipation from taking the narcotic pain medication - oxycodone. Lastly, Acetaminophen was used as a supplementary method for pain relief and specifically for headaches.  As for the distractors:  A: Acetaminophen was indeed prescribed during the patient's second visit to the hospital to manage abdominal pain, rather than her first visit.   B: Amlodipine is a medication used to manage high blood pressure, but it was not mentioned in the discharge medications list for the patient's first visit.  C: Fluticasone Propionate, a medication used for nasal issues, was also prescribed during the patient's second visit to the hospital, not the first.  E: Albuterol Inhaler, used for asthma attacks, was also prescribed during the patient's second visit to the hospital, not the first."
36,2,15479157,What was the reason given for the delayed breast reconstruction surgery that patient underwent?,The surgery was postponed due to the patient's allergic reactions.,The patient first needed to complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent irradiation therapy after her mastectomy.,The patient's history of stroke deterred the immediate reconstruction.,There was a complication with the mastectomy that caused delay.,The surgery was delayed due to the patient's thyroid nodule with indeterminate cytology.,B,"In the discharge summary, it was outlined that the patient had to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy and required irradiation therapy following her mastectomy. This was the reason for delayed breast reconstruction. Option A is incorrect because the patient was recorded as having no known allergies to drugs. Option C isn't accurate as her stroke history did not impact the timing of the reconstruction surgery. Option D is not supported by the notes, as there was no mention of complications from the mastectomy causing delay. Option E is incorrect as the thyroid nodule condition is related to a different surgery and not linked to the delay in the breast reconstruction surgery."
37,2,14307597,What was the major surgical procedure conducted during the patient's first admission and how was his condition upon discharge post the procedure?,His major procedure was removal of a multifocal pneumonia during his first admission and was discharged with a stable condition.,The main surgical procedure conducted was bladder tumor resection and he was in a stable condition upon discharge.,The primary invasive procedure during his first admission was a small bowel obstruction operation and he passed away after the procedure.,No surgical procedure was conducted during his first admission and he was discharged in a stable condition.,The major procedure was a pacemaker/ICD device insertion during his first admission and he was released in good health.,B,"In the first note, it is outlined that the patient underwent a ""Transurethral resection of bladder tumor"" making option B the correct answer. Upon discharge his condition was mentioned as stable. Option A mentions removal of a multifocal pneumonia which was actually part of his second admission's diagnosis rather than an operative procedure. Option C is incorrect, as the small bowel obstruction was part of his second admission's diagnosis and not linked to a surgical procedure in the first admission. Option D is misleading because there was indeed a surgical operation during the first admission. Option E incorrectly assigns a surgical procedure, as the patient had a pacemaker, but its insertion was not a procedure mentioned during the first visit."
38,2,15522162,What was the medications given to the patient at discharge on her second visit to the hospital (Chartdate : 2133-03-17) and what were they for?,"The patient was discharged with Tylenol for migraines, Unisom for sleep, and B6 for nausea at her second hospital visit.","The patient was given Famotidine 20 mg for stomach irritation, Promethazine 25 mg, Ondansetron for nausea, and Timolol Maleate for hypertension her second time at the hospital.","The patient was released with prescriptions for Acetaminophen for general pain relief, Oxycodone for severe pain relief, Pre-natal vitamins for supplementation during pregnancy, and Ranitidine for acid reflux during her second hospital stay.",The patient was discharged with orders for Albuterol as needed for asthma and Tylenol for migraines for during her second visit to the hospital.,"The patient left the hospital with a prescription for Zofran, a medication approved by her insurance, to manage nausea during her second visit to the hospital.",C,"The notes from the patient's second hospital stay (Chartdate : 2133-03-17) show that she was discharged with prescriptions for Acetaminophen, Oxycodone, Pre-natal vitamins, and Ranitidine. These medications were for general pain, severe pain, nutritional supplementation during pregnancy, and gastric acid control, respectively.   The rest of the options, while containing correct information from the patient's hospital visits, all come from the first visit, making them incorrect in the context of the question."
39,2,18367453,"What were the noticeable changes in the patient's conditions when she was admitted in her two different instances, particularly in terms of the nature of her twins and contractions?",The nature of the twins was identical in both instances and the frequency of contractions increased in the second instance.,"In the first instance, she was carrying di-di twins and had contractions after contacts, while in the second instance, she was carrying mono-di twins and had preterm contractions.","In both instances, she was carrying di-di twins, but the intensity of contractions remained the same.","The nature of the twins changed from di-di to mono-di, but the contractions remained the same in both instances.",The patient was carrying mono-di twins in both instances and contractions escalated in the second instance.,B,"In the first admission, the patient was carrying dichorionic diamniotic (di-di) twins and was having contractions intermittently which became regular and painful during the morning of admission. In contrast, during her second admission, she was pregnant with monochorionic diamniotic (mono-di) twins and was having preterm contractions that had started several days prior to her admission and became more severe on the day of admission. Choices A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they inaccurately represent the changes in the nature of her twins and/or her contraction patterns across the two admissions."
40,2,17174808,What was the patient's hospital course and management during the second admission?,Patient was entered into the hospital due to abdominal pain and managed with regular diet and IVF.,The patient came to the hospital due to non-specific bowel gas pattern and managed with Prozac 20mg DAILY.,"The patient arrived at the hospital due to intermittent bright red blood, and she was managed with iron and vitamin B12 supplements.","The patient was admitted for partial small bowel obstruction and managed conservatively with bowel rest, IV fluids, and diet enhancement.","The patient was admitted to the hospital due to depression disorder, and she was managed with Fluoxetine 20 mg PO DAILY.",D,"In the second admission, the patient was admitted due to partial small bowel obstruction (as mentioned in the discharge diagnosis of note 2). The management included treating conservatively with bowel rest and intravenous fluids (IV fluids). In the afternoon, the patient's diet was gradually advanced, first to clear liquids and then to a regular diet with her tolerating it well. These details match option D.  Option A is incorrect because it's only related to the first admission hospital course and management. Option B is incorrect because Prozac was a medication, not a management strategy for the present condition. Option C is incorrect because the patient did not admit for intermittent bright red blood. Option E is incorrect because she did not admit due to depression."
41,2,12422981,What were the symptoms and subsequent diagnosis that led to the patient's readmission shortly after their discharge from a gynecologic procedure?,The patient was readmitted due to symptoms of a soft abdomen and subsequently diagnosed with an uncomplicated post-operative course.,"The patient was readmitted due to symptoms of symptomatic fibroid uterus, stress urinary incontinence and subsequently diagnosed with a final pathology pending.","The patient was readmitted due to symptoms related to vaginal cuff cellulitis and mesh erosion from a suburethral sling, subsequently diagnosed with possible early abscess.",The patient was readmitted due to symptoms of heightened white blood cell counts and was consequently diagnosed with sepsis.,The patient was readmitted due to symptoms following a total laparoscopic hysterectomy bilateral salpingectomy but was not diagnosed with a specific condition.,C,"The patient was readmitted due to symptoms concerning for vaginal cuff cellulitis and the erosion of a suburethral sling. The subsequent diagnosis confirmed the possibility of an early abscess (Note 2). The other options are incorrect as they don't align with the information provided in the discharge summaries. Option A is incorrect because the patient's abdomen being soft is a normal physical exam finding rather than a symptom leading to readmission. Option B is incorrect because those were initial symptoms leading to the original operation, not symptoms causing a readmission. Option D is incorrect as the patient did not show any signs of sepsis. Option E is wrong because the patient was diagnosed with a specific condition upon readmission."
42,2,17333645,What surgical and non-surgical treatments did the patient undergo for her abdominal pain related to endometriosis?,She was subjected to endoscopy and medication (Pantoprazole) for gastritis.,She underwent a minor surgery to treat her viral meningitis.,The patient was on intensive fluid therapy (IV fluids).,"She underwent Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, extensive lysis of adhesions and then given pain medication.",She was given multivitamins as part of her treatment protocol.,D,"The patient underwent two profound treatments related to her abdominal pain resulting from her severe endometriosis. The first treatment was non-surgical; she was subjected to endoscopy and was administered Pantoprazole for her abdominal pain (related to gastritis) as seen in Note 1. The second treatment, as mentioned in Note 2, was surgical; she underwent a Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and extensive lysis of adhesions. The patient also received pain medication, indicating that her treatment included both surgical and non-surgical methods. The other options are distractors from the same note but do not fully answer the question as they do not include both types of treatments (surgical and non-surgical) that the patient underwent for her abdominal pain related to endometriosis."
43,2,10471358,What was the patient's condition on discharge after the removal of her ureteral stent?,"The patient was discharged in a good condition, tolerating oral intake and adequately hydrating.",The patient was no longer experiencing nausea and vomiting and was well controlled with oral pain medication.,There was a worsening of the patient's left flank pain after removing the ureteral stent.,The ureteral stent removal was not completed due to migration of the tip of the stent.,The patient was discharged home and was maintained on a diet as tolerated with stable pain management.,B,"The correct answer can be inferred from the discharge summary, which indicates that ""On the day of discharge, she was voiding adequate amounts of urine, tolerating oral intake, and hydrating herself adequately without the need for IV fluids"" and her pain was well controlled with oral pain medication.  Options A, C, and D provide false information. The patient was stable, but not good during discharge (disproving A), her pain was not worsening (disproving C), and the stent removal was completed under anesthesia, not incomplete (disproving D). Option E is partly true as the patient was indeed discharged home however, it does not give a full account of the patient's condition which includes key aspects such as tolerance to oral intake and adequate self-hydration capabilities which were also achieved by the patient upon discharge. Thus, only option B fully and correctly answers the doctor's question."
44,2,17133967,"What is the blood pressure management for this patient after her second admission, and why might this be necessary?",The patient was given amoxicillin to manage blood pressure which was necessary due to a cesarean delivery.,The patient was started on betamethasone for the management of blood pressure which was necessary due to intermittent variable decels observed during routine NSTs.,The patient was given labetalol to manage blood pressure which was necessary due to severe range blood pressures and the presence of headache and epigastric pain postpartum.,"The patient was administered magnesium for blood pressure management, necessary due to the diagnosis postpartum preeclampsia.",Levothyroxine was administered for managing blood pressure as the patient showed signs of hypothyroidism postpartum.,C,"The patient was started on labetalol 400mg twice a day after her second admission due to severe range blood pressures and the presence of headache and epigastric pain, indicating postpartum preeclampsia (from note 2). The other options are incorrect but serve as good distractors - amoxicillin (choice A) is mentioned as an allergy, not as a medication for managing blood pressure; betamethasone (choice B) was administered during the first admission for fetal lung maturity, not for blood pressure management; magnesium (choice D) was indeed administered, but for seizure prophylaxis, not for blood pressure control; levothyroxine (choice E) was prescribed due to the patient's ongoing hypothyroidism, it is not typically used to manage blood pressure."
45,2,11898628,"What were the reasons for the patient's two hospitalizations as mentioned in the discharge summaries, and what measures were taken following each hospital stay?",The patient was first hospitalized for a urinary tract infection and given antibiotics and was then admitted secondly due to a broken arm and was put in a cast.,"The patient was hospitalized first due to right upper quadrant pain related to cholelithiasis with actions taken including labor induction, pain control with Dilaudid and subsequent vaginal delivery. The patient was planned to arrange for a cholecystectomy after this stay. Second admission was due to elevated blood pressure and was managed by monitoring, urine collection and improvement of blood pressure via Nifedipine.","The patient had two hospitalizations due to uncontrolled hypertension and on both occasions, medications were adjusted.","The patient was first admitted for preterm labor and given measures to slow labor down, and then hospitalized a second time for postpartum depression and given therapy and medications for it.",The patient was first admitted due to high blood glucose levels and treated with insulin. The second admission was due to complications of diabetes and poorly controlled glucose levels.,B,"In the given discharge summaries, it is clearly stated that the patient was first admitted due to discomfort and pain related to cholelithiasis (gallstones), it was managed with medication(Dilaudid), and the patient gave birth during this stay. Measures after this stay included a plan for a cholecystectomy. The second time the patient was hospitalized was due to an elevated blood pressure which was associated with her pregnancy. The management included monitoring her pressure, medications(Nifedipine) to control the blood pressure, and a 24 hour urine collection to evaluate for preeclampsia. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect as these situations aren't mentioned in any of the provided discharge summaries."
46,2,17224583,What was the surgical procedure undertaken on the patient's second visit to the hospital and how did he respond postoperatively?,The patient underwent a percutaneous pinning of fractures on his left foot and was admitted for vital signs monitoring.,"The patient underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for a Lisfranc fracture dislocation and for a fracture on his second metatarsal. He was admitted post-operatively for pain control and bed rest, and handled the procedure well without any complications. ","The patient had a removal of skeletal external fixator in his left foot, and was admitted for monitoring of any potential allergic reactions.","The patient underwent a closed reduction, percutaneous k-wire, and external monorail fixation placement for treatment of multiple left foot fractures, and was managed with IV pain medications postoperatively.","The patient was operated on for multiple fractures in his left foot, including metatarsal, medial cuneiform, and bases of several metatarsals, and was transferred for podiatry evaluation subsequently.",B,"According to the given discharge summary, during the patient's second visit to the hospital, an open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) was performed for his Lisfranc fracture dislocation and for a fracture in the second metatarsal of his left foot. His postoperative response was positive without any complications. He was admitted for pain control and bed rest. Other options contain some information from the notes but none of them accurately answer the doctor's question. For instance, choices A and D refer to procedures from the first visit while C and E either discuss a minor aspect of the overall procedure or highlight incidences from before surgery, respectively."
47,2,10269553,What surgical procedures were performed on the patient to address her metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver?,Left hemicolectomy,Tubal ligation,C-section,xploratory laparotomy with segment 4A resection and segment II resection,Myomectomy for uterine fibroids,D,"The text in note 2 mentions the specific surgical procedures performed to address the patient's metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver: an exploratory laparotomy, intraoperative ultrasound, segment 4A resection with additional margin, and segment II resection. This makes choice D the correct answer. choices A, B and E are incorrect because they are referring to the past medical procedures done to the patient and not specifically for her metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver. Choice C refers to her past medical history and not what was done to specifically address her metastatic colorectal cancer to her liver, making it incorrect."
48,2,19304049,What was the method of treatment for the patient's breast infection after her major surgical procedure and what reason led to that particular treatment?,The patient was prescribed regular diet and light physical activity after her surgical procedure due to the development of erythema.,"As the patient developed implant associated breast infection, the PICC line was removed and a new one was inserted. This procedure was used because the original PICC line was potentially causing the infection.",The patient received a Bupropion treatment due to suspicions about her infectious condition. The Bupropion was administered as it was believed to help calm her physical and psychological state.,The patient was given intravenous vancomycin for 2 weeks after her operation due to suspicion of infection even though cultures were negative.,"The diagnosis found the presence of an underlying rheumatic heart condition, leading to the introduction of heart medication for her breast infection.",D,"The discharge summary mentions that due to high suspicion of infection regardless of negative cultures, the patient was recommended to continue with Vancomycin treatment for 2 more weeks after her surgery (option D). The other options are incorrect as they don't reflect the accurate response to the infection or the reason behind it. Option A is misleading as the cause for the diet and activity recommendation was post-surgery recovery, not the infection treatment. Option B is incorrect because there's no indication the PICC line was replaced due to the infection. Option C is wrong as Bupropion was a part of her regular medication and not specifically for the infection. Option E is incorrect as there's no link between her rheumatic heart condition and the treatment for breast infection."
49,2,16893081,"Did the patient's medication regimen change between her first surgery on March 30, 2172, and her second surgery on July 12, 2172. If so, what changes were made?","The patient was prescribed Docusate Sodium for constipation in addition to her previous medications, but her dosage of Midodrine was reduced.","The patient was prescribed Oxycodone as an extra medication, and her dosage of Fludrocortisone was increased.","The dosage of Midodrine and Fludrocortisone remained the same as before, but the patient was prescribed Oxycodone and Docusate Sodium as additional medications.",There were no changes in the medication regimen between her first surgery and second surgery.,"The patient was prescribed a higher dosage of Oxycodone and an added medication Docusate Sodium, but her initial medications Midodrine and Fludrocortisone were discontinued.",C,"In the notes from her first surgery, the patient was taking Midodrine and Fludrocortisone. Following her second surgery, she continued to take these medications, but also began taking Oxycodone for pain and Docusate Sodium for constipation. Answer choices A and B are incorrect as there was no change in the dosage of Midodrine and Fludrocortisone. Answer D is also wrong because two new medications (Oxycodone and Docusate Sodium) were added. E is incorrect as the patient continued taking Midodrine and Fludrocortisone, along with the added Oxycodone and Docusate Sodium."
50,2,14348760,"What was the patient's mode of delivery during the pregnancy described in these summaries, and what was the reason for choosing that method?",The patient had a vaginal delivery due to her previous history of vaginal delivery.,The patient had a vaginal delivery due to the fetus's breech position.,The patient had a cesarean section delivery due to the patient's history of premature deliveries.,The patient had a cesarean section delivery due to the preterm premature rupture of membranes and the breech presentation.,The patient had a cesarean section delivery due to the patient's history of cesarean section deliveries.,D,"In note 2, it was stated that the patient ""underwent a repeat low transverse cesarean section"" following a preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and that the fetus had a breech presentation. This is the most accurate answer as it specifically states the mode of delivery and the reasons for it. Choice A is incorrect as it was a cesarean section, not a vaginal delivery. Choice B is incorrect as due to the breech position, a cesarean section was performed instead of a vaginal delivery. Choice C is incorrect as the case does not mention premature deliveries as a reason for the cesarean section. Choice E is incorrect because, even though the patient had a history of cesarean sections, it was the PPROM and breech presentation that prompted the delivery mode in this case."
51,2,18506510,What led to the recurrent abscess in the patient's right thigh and what was the subsequent treatment plan?,The abscess was caused by previous hypertension and the abscess was drained surgically.,The patient's regular IV testosterone usage led to the recurrent abscess which was then surgically drained.,"The abscess resulted from the patient's history of laceration of the right radial nerve, and was treated with oral medications.",The abscess was caused due to the history of eczema in the patient and it was treated with oral anticoagulants.,The recurrent abscess was due to the patient's prior condition of achalasia and it was managed with routine diet and oral medications.,B,"Option B accurately represents the situation. The patient developed a recurrent thigh abscess from injecting intramuscular testosterone. The surgical procedure of draining and debridement was carried out, backed up by antibiotic treatment with cefazolin and clindamycin.  Option A, C, D, and E include details from the summary but are incorrect as hypertension, laceration of the right radial nerve, eczema, and achalasia did not cause the abscess. Also, the treatment strategies mentioned under these options are incorrect. Using distractors that constitute real data from the notes makes them plausible wrong answers, as they might mislead those who haven't fully understood the question or the context."
52,2,19794621,Why was a stent placed in the patient's right ACOMM aneurysm and when did this procedure take place?,"The stent was placed due to the recanalization of the Left MCA aneurysm, on the admission date 24784261.","The stent was placed to avoid an infarct resulting from obstructed flow to adjacent vessels, and the procedure was performed on March 16, 2136.","The stent was placed for recoiling of the left MCA aneurysm, and the procedure was performed on the admission date 24854893.","The stent was placed to treat pressure on the aneurysm and reduce the risk of rupture, the procedure was done on June 22, 2136.","The stent was placed to prevent a subarachnoid hemorrhage, on the admission date 24854893.",D,"According to note 2, the stent was placed in the ACOMM aneurysm to limit pressure and prevent a rupture. The Chartdate shows that the procedure took place on June 22, 2136. Choice A is incorrect because it refers to the recanalization of the Left MCA aneurysm, not the right ACOMM aneurysm. Choice B is wrong because it mentions the wrong date. Choice C is incorrect because the recoiling was for the left MCA aneurysm not the right ACOMM. Choice E is incorrect because the stent was not placed as a preventative measure for a subarachnoid hemorrhage."
53,2,13137719,What was the surgical history of the patient on the visit dated 2167-06-13?,The patient underwent a cholecystectomy in the past.,The patient experienced Right Upper Quadrant pain but no surgeries were reported on this date.,The patient underwent a rescue cerclage procedure.,The patient was admitted with urinary retention and abdominal pain but there were no surgical procedures reported.,The patient had a prior pregnancy but no surgeries were reported on this date.,C,"In the discharge summary dated 2167-06-13 (note 2), it is indicated that the patient underwent a 'rescue cerclage procedure'. This is the only surgery mentioned for the patient's visit on the specific date questioned, thus making option C the right answer. Option A is incorrect since the patient's cholecystectomy was part of the past surgical history, not related to the visit on the specific date. Options B, D, and E are incorrect as well- while some conditions are mentioned, there is no surgery reported in any of these options directly relating to the visit dated 2167-06-13."
54,2,13129207,What were the major surgical procedures performed on the patient during their first and second hospital visit respectively and what are the medications prescribed when discharged?,"During the first visit, the patient underwent a Left distal radius fracture and during the second visit, a Right tibial nail & ORIF fibula. When discharged, enoxaparin, aspirin and multivitamin were prescribed.","During the first visit, the patient underwent a right tibial nail & ORIF fibula, and during the second visit, an open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius fracture. When discharged, Multivitamin, Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium and Rosuvastatin Calcium were prescribed.","During the first visit, the patient had an open reduction and internal fixation of the right tibia and fibula, with the second visit involving an open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius fracture. Medications prescribed during discharge were: Enoxaparin, Oxycodone, Multivitamin, Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Lisinopril, OxycoDONE (Immediate Release), Rosuvastatin Calcium, and Aspirin.","The patient underwent a Right tibial nail & ORIF fibula during the first visit, and open reduction and internal fixation of right tibia and fibula during the second visit. Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed enoxaparin, multivitamin, and acetaminophen.","In the first hospital visit, the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius fracture and during the second visit, a left distal radius fracture procedure was performed. Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Lisinopril, OxycoDONE (Immediate Release), Rosuvastatin calcium and Aspirin.",C,"The correct answer is C because in the first visit, the patient underwent right tibial nail & ORIF fibula surgery as found in note 1. During the second visit, the patient had an open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius fracture according to note 2. Upon discharge after both visits, the patient was prescribed the following medications: Enoxaparin, Oxycodone, Multivitamin (from the first visit), and Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Lisinopril, OxycoDONE (Immediate Release), Rosuvastatin Calcium, and Aspirin (from the second visit). The other options are incorrect because they either list the wrong surgeries or incorrectly list the discharge medications. Although D and E also list the correct surgeries, their lists of discharge medications are incomplete, making them incorrect."
55,2,17014101,What surgeries has the patient undergone for their process of gender affirmation?,The patient underwent a heart surgery.,"The patient had a total laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and cystoscopy procedures completed.",The patient underwent a surgical procedure to address symptomatic fibroid uterus.,The patient had plastic surgery on their face.,The patient underwent surgery for appendicitis.,B,"B is the correct answer because the surgery described is thorough and aligns with the patient's gender affirmation process. In the first note, the patient underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and cystoscopy procedure, which removes female reproductive organs. Option A is incorrect because there is no mention of the patient undergoing heart surgery in their gender affirmation process. Option C is wrong because the surgical procedure mentioned pertains to a specific medical condition—symptomatic fibroid uterus—and not the patient's gender affirmation process. Option D is not correct because there is no mention of the patient having facial plastic surgery as part of their gender affirmation process. Option E is incorrect as the patient did not undergo surgery for appendicitis."
56,2,17364143,What was the medical procedure performed in the first admission due to the patient's compartment syndrome and was it successful?,"Complete anterior and lateral compartment fasciectomy, and partial posterior compartment fasciectomy, both bilateral.",Resection of bilateral popliteal artery.,Bilateral popliteal artery decompression.,"Partial fasciectomy posterior component, unilateral.",Superficial sensory nerve resection in the left peroneal nerve.,A,"The correct answer is A since the patient's medical record indicates that the patient underwent a complete anterior and lateral compartment fasciectomy and a partial fasciectomy of the posterior compartment in both her legs during the first admission. Though these surgical procedures were indeed performed, it wasn't mentioned directly in the notes whether they were successful or not. However, the fact that the patient was able to walk and felt ready for discharge indicates that the surgeries went well in managing the pain stemming from the compartment syndrome. The rest of the options are incorrect: B and C refer to a procedure performed in the second admission (popliteal artery decompression,) D mentions a unilateral treatment which is not true as per the notes, and E is a distractor as the nerve resection was in the right peroneal nerve, not the left."
57,2,12322351,"What medications were prescribed to the patient upon discharge from his second hospitalization, and how do they compare to those prescribed upon discharge from his first hospitalization?","Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, and Sodium Chloride spray were prescribed on discharge from the first hospitalization and Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Seroquel, and Xanax were prescribed on discharge from his second hospitalization.","Augmentin, Vicodin, and Dilaudid were prescribed on discharge from both the first and second hospitalizations.","The patient was prescribed only Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Seroquel, and Xanax in both hospitalizations.","The same medications were prescribed in both hospitalizations, which include Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, and Sodium Chloride spray.",The patient was prescribed vancomycin and zosyn for both hospitalizations.,A,"The correct answer is A. During the first hospitalization, Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, Vancomycin, Sodium Chloride spray, Saline Flush, and Heparin Lock Flush were prescribed on discharge. On the other hand, during the second hospitalization, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Seroquel, and Xanax were prescribed on discharge. Hence, there was a difference in the set of medications prescribed upon discharge from his first and second hospitalization. Option B is incorrect as Augmentin, Vicodin, and Dilaudid were the medications on admission in the first hospitalization, not on discharge. Option C is incorrect as those psychotropic meds were prescribed only during the second hospitalization, not the first. Option D is misleading as it suggests the same medications were prescribed for both hospitalizations, which is clearly not the case. Lastly, option E is incorrect as Vancomycin was prescribed only during the first hospitalization and not during the second one."
58,2,11474193,"What significant abnormalities were noted in the patient's ultrasound examination during her first admission, and what was the treatment provided for her condition?",The ultrasound revealed ruptured cysts in her ovaries and she was treated with antibiotics.,The patient's ultrasound showed ectopic pregnancy and she was treated with methotrexate.,"The ultrasound highlighted fibroids and hematometra, and the patient received blood transfusions and Lupron injection as treatment.","The ultrasound showed an enlarged spleen, and she was treated with splenic artery embolization.","The patient’s ultrasound examination revealed gallstones, and she was treated with ursodeoxycholic acid.",C,"In the notes from the first admission, it was reported that the patient's ultrasound revealed both fibroids and hematometra. The patient was treated with two units of blood and a Lupron injection due to anemia and the vaginal bleeding. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer. Although the other choices include medical terminologies and treatments that could be plausible in other contexts, they do not apply to this patient's condition as reflected in the notes."
59,2,19889567,Did the patient develop any complications during or following her Right L5-S1 Discectomy procedure and how were they managed?,The patient experienced severe back pain due to the herniated disc and was managed with oral pain medication.,A retinal detachment complication occurred during the patient's procedure which was managed with ocular surgery.,The patient displayed signs of incontinence after the procedure which was managed with physical therapy.,The patient developed a post-operative headache which was resolved by changing and discontinuing certain medications.,"A small fluid collection was noted in the MRI, which was managed by draining the fluid surgically.",D,"The discharge summary documents in note 1 and note 2 reveal that the patient had developed a post-operative headache following the Right L5-S1 Discectomy procedure. This was managed by changing her medication and discontinuing the use of narcotic medications. The other options are incorrect as these points were either not highlighted as complications from the discectomy procedure (options A and C) or they were unrelated to the procedure (option B). Option E is incorrect as, although the small fluid collection was noted in the MRI, it was not consistent with CSF, and the patient did not undergo a procedure to drain it. They instead changed her medication to resolve her headaches."
60,2,17819393,What complications arose during the patient's exploratory laparotomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and how were they addressed?,"The surgery was interrupted by a sudden spike in the patient's blood glucose levels, which was promptly controlled with insulin.","The patient suffered a tear to the bowel and mesentery during the procedure, which were surgically repaired.","The patient experienced tachycardia during the procedure, which was addressed with beta blockers.","The patient had multiple complications including allergic reaction to the anesthesia, however fast actions by the anesthesiology team managed the situation effectively.","The patient's blood oxygen level dropped during the surgery, and supplemental oxygen was administered to correct this.",B,"According to note 2, the patient's surgery was complicated by a bowel serosal tear and mesenteric tear, but these were promptly repaired. General Surgery was consulted during the operation to ensure the bowel looked reassuring, which it did. The other options, although viable complications that can occur during surgery, were not mentioned in the notes and are therefore incorrect. For example, the patient did experience tachycardia after the surgery (Option C), but this was not a complication that occurred during the procedure itself. Furthermore, it was not treated with beta blockers; instead, it resolved spontaneously. Option A, D, and E, are fabricated scenarios and they weren't mentioned in the given notes."
61,2,19234519,"What major surgical procedures has the patient undertaken based on the provided discharge summaries, and when have these occurred?",Patient had a hip replacement surgery in the month of July.,"Patient had L5-S1 Microdisc and Total thyroidectomy, transplant left lower parathyroid to left sternocleidomastoid on unspecified dates.",Patient had a lumbar spine surgery in the month of November.,Patient had a heart bypass surgery in the month of August.,Patient had a knee replacement surgery in the month of December.,B,"Based on the provided discharge summaries, the patient underwent two major surgeries, L5-S1 Microdisc and Total thyroidectomy, transplant left lower parathyroid to left sternocleidomastoid as mentioned in note 1 and 2 respectively; however, the exact dates when these procedures took place are not provided in the summaries.  Option A, C, D and E are incorrect as there were no mentions of hip replacement, lumbar spine surgery, heart bypass surgery or knee replacement in the provided discharge summaries. Therefore, they serve as good distractors. All the mentioned surgeries in the options are common procedures that the patient of this age might have undergone, making the options plausible distractors."
62,2,13422672,What were the major surgical or invasive procedures done on the patient during his first and second admission?,The patient had an MRI scan of the right ankle.,The patient underwent a physiotherapy session to improve his strength and mobility.,The patient received a closed reduction right distal tibia fracture with external fixator placement during the first admission and ORIF Right distal tibia fracture with removal of external fixator and incisional VAC placement during the second admission.,The patient had a short leg cast placement during the first admission.,The patient received the lateral ligament injury operation.,C,"In the first admission note, it is stated that the major surgical procedure done on the patient was a ""Closed reduction right distal tibia fracture with external fixator placement"". During the second admission, according to the note, the patient underwent ""ORIF Right distal tibia fracture with removal of external fixator and incisional VAC placement"".   Choices A, D, and E are incorrect as there is no information about MRI scans, short leg cast placement in the first admission, or the operation on a lateral ligament injury in notes. Choice B is incorrect as physical therapy, though important, is not classified as a surgical or invasive procedure."
63,2,17161383,What were the exact surgical procedures the patient underwent on his first admission and what was his condition when he was discharged to rehab?,"The patient had a Coronary Artery Bypass Graft and a Bioprosthetic Valve Replacement, and was discharged in severe condition.","The patient underwent a Coronary Arthropathy Bypass Graft and a Bioprosthetic Valve Replacement, and was discharged in good condition.","The patient underwent a Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 3 and an Aortic Valve Replacement, and was discharged in good condition.","The patient had a Coronary Artery Bioplasty and an Aortic Valve Repair, and was discharged in critical condition.","The patient performed a Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and an Aortic Valve Decannulation, and was discharged in stable condition.",C,"In the discharge summary, the exact surgical procedures the patient underwent are referred to as ""CABG x 3 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM and PDA), AVR"" meaning Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 3 and Aortic Valve Replacement. According to the discharge notes, the patient's condition upon discharge was good. Though options A, B, D, and E also mentioned a similar surgery, they either misrepresented the surgery details or misunderstood the patient's condition at discharge."
64,2,12295627,"What was the primary concern upon the patient's initial admission, any major procedure undertaken, and any changes in the patient's condition and treatment during subsequent hospital visit?","Initially admitted due to B12 deficiency and underwent lumbar puncture, with the subsequent visit revealing unchanged symptoms and a change in pain medication.","Initially admitted due to general headache and underwent a surgery, with the subsequent visit revealing an alleviation in symptoms and change in discharge medications.","Initially admitted due to facial and retroorbital pain along with horizontal diplopia and underwent LP, with the subsequent visit revealing a right cavernous sinus mass diagnosis and change in pain control medication.","Initially admitted due to vertigo and underwent brain MRI, with the subsequent visit showing an improvement in symptoms and no change in prescribed medications.","Initially admitted due to seizures and underwent physical therapy, with the following visit showing progression of the disease and a new allergic reaction discovered.",C,"The correct answer is Option C because the patient was firstly admitted because of facial and retroorbital pain along with diplopia (double vision), as mentioned in the Chief Complaint section of note 1. The main procedure carried out at this time was an LP or lumbar puncture, found in the Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure section. On the subsequent hospital visit (note 2), it is revealed that the patient was diagnosed with a cavernous sinus mass (Discharge Diagnosis) and the prescribed pain medication was changed with an added medication-Oxycodone. Option A is incorrect because the patient's B12 deficiency is part of their past medical history and not the main reason for their admission. Option B is incorrect as the patient did not undergo any surgical procedure as per the Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure section. Option D is wrong because the patient was not admitted for vertigo, and Option E is also erroneous because the patient did not seek care for seizures or physical therapy."
65,2,15883206,"What were the characteristics of the initial abdominal pain experienced by the patient during her first admission, and what objective findings were observed?",The patient experienced severe periumbilical pain along with continuous vomiting and elevated liver function tests.,"The patient had no loss of appetite, described no periumbilical pain, fevers, nausea, or vomiting; and had normal bowel movements. The pain was localized to the right lower quadrant area with some rebound.","The patient had fevers, nausea, vomiting, and periumbilical pain. The patient's pain was localized to the upper abdominal quadrants and had no rebound tenderness.","The patient was experiencing acute left lower quadrant pain with associated nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left lower quadrant without any signs of rebound or guarding.","The patient was experiencing severe lower back pain, with physical examination showing tenderness in the lower spine. No abnormal findings were noted in the abdominal examination.",B,"According to the discharge summary, the patient had mild right lower quadrant pain with no loss of appetite, and no periumbilical pain, or fevers, nausea or vomiting. Her bowel movements were normal. The physical examination showed the patient's pain was localized to the right lower quadrant area, with some rebounds but no rovsings and negative psoas and obdurator signs. The laboratory findings were mostly normal. The options A, C, D, and E may seem plausible, but they describe symptoms and findings that are not mentioned in the discharge summary for the patient's initial admission."
66,2,11072575,What were the significant changes in the patient's condition between his previous hospital visit on 2147-11-30 and the recent one on 2148-01-19?,The patient developed an allergic reaction on the second visit.,The patient's C5 fracture was not responsive to conservative therapy and it resulted in C5-C6 instability.,The patient's rib fractures got worsen on the second visit.,The patient's alcohol intake increased by the second visit.,"On the second visit, patient's Temperature, Heart Rate, and Blood Pressure significantly changed.",B,"The patient initially underwent a car accident (motor vehicle collision) and obtained multiple rib fractures and a C5 fracture [note 1]. The subsequent visit indicates that the patient's C5 fracture failed conservative therapy and developed C5-C6 instability which led to surgery [note 2]. The rest of the options (A, C, D, and E) are good distractors but incorrect because they imply changes that are not mentioned in the notes. There is no mention of an allergic reaction (A) or worsening of rib fractures (C) or an increased alcohol intake (D) by the patient on the second visit. Also, there is no signal indicating a significant change in the patient's Temperature, Heart Rate, and Blood Pressure (E) between both visits."
67,2,11520801,What were changes in the patient's medication regimen after the second admission compared to the first?,The patient was prescribed to take acetaminophen daily on discharge after the second admission,The quantity of gabapentin taken daily was significantly reduced after the second admission,Oxycodone-acetaminophen was replaced with diazepam for pain control on the patient's discharge after the second admission,Simvastatin was switched with hydrochlorothiazide during the patient's second admission,Taking docusate sodium was discontinued on discharge after the second admission,C,"After the second admission, the patient's prescribed medication changed and Oxycodone-acetaminophen, prescribed prior to and after the first admission, was replaced by Diazepam and Acetaminophen on discharge. The four other options are incorrect. A: Though acetaminophen was newly introduced in the post-discharge medication regimen after the second admission, it was not taken daily but as needed (""PRN"") for fever or pain. B: The quantity of Gabapentin was actually increased after the second admission, not reduced. D: Simvastatin and Hydrochlorothiazide were not switched; both medications remained consistent in the patient's regimen across the two admissions. E: Docusate Sodium was actually continued post-discharge after the second admission, not discontinued. These options, while inaccurate, are good distractors because they all refer to drugs mentioned in the patient's medication regimen."
68,2,12387743,"What procedural changes can be noted between the patient's admission on 2144-07-28 and 2152-03-24, concerning her cervical stenosis and lumbar pain?","The patient's allergies changed, and she was no longer allergic to any drugs.",The primary condition moved from cervical stenosis to leg pain.,The patient underwent an ACDF C5/C6 procedure during both admissions.,The surgical procedure in the second admission was ACDF C5/C6.,"In the second admission, the patient was suffering from bilateral lower extremity symptoms.",B,"The primary condition of the patient on her admission on 2144-07-28 was 'cervical stenosis', and she underwent an ACDF C5/C6 procedure (note 1). However, in her admission on 2152-03-24, her chief complaint was 'leg pain' and she had an 'L2-S1 laminectomy' (note 2), showing a progression in her condition and a change in procedures.   Option A is incorrect as the patient developed an allergy to gabapentin in the second admission. Option C is wrong as she only underwent ACDF C5/C6 in her first admission. Option D is not right as the procedure in her second admission was L2-S1 laminectomy not ACDF C5/C6. Lastly, option E is tempting as the patient indeed suffered from bilateral lower extremity symptoms in the second admission, but this doesn't represent a procedural change and fails to address her cervical stenosis and lumbar pain, making option B the correct answer."
69,2,11567317,What were the complications experienced by the patient after her colonoscopy procedure?,The patient experienced upper abdominal pain and signs of appendicitis,The patient showed signs of mild abruption and had to be re-admitted,"The patient experienced persistent abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and leukocytosis",The patient experienced a significant amount of free fluid and free air,The patient showed issues with her current medications and had allergic reactions,C,"According to note 2, the patient was admitted after complications from her colonoscopy and reported symptoms such as persistent abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and increased white blood cell count known as leukocytosis. These symptoms suggest that the patient had an infection, likely due to the colonoscopy. The other options are incorrect but serve as good distractors. Option A is incorrect as there is no mention of upper abdominal pain or appendicitis. Option B refers to a mild abruption, which occurred during a past pregnancy and is unrelated to the colonoscopy. Option D is a false representation of the CT scan result, which noted a small amount of free fluid but no significant amount or any free air. Lastly, option E is incorrect as there were no issues or allergic reactions related to her medications after the colonoscopy procedure."
70,2,19668026,What was the initial treatment strategy for the patient's bacteremia which led to her re-admission?,The patient was initially prescribed prenatal vitamins.,The patient was treated with a cervical cerclage placement.,The patient was given IV antibiotics followed by oral linezolid after 5 days of no additional growth in her blood cultures.,The patient was given IV bactrim for her bacteremia.,The patient was treated with IV antibiotics and a D&C procedure.,C,"According to note 1, the patient was initially admitted due to bacteremia, a result of a septic abortion. The treatment strategy for her bacteremia was initially IV antibiotics. After 5 days with no additional growth in her blood cultures from her bacteremia, the patient was advised to transition to oral linezolid and discharged home with additional 7 days of antibiotics. Thus, option C is the correct answer. Options A and B are incorrect as the notes suggest that these treatments were provided after her discharge for bacteremia in note 1. Option D is incorrect, as the discharge summary does not mention bactrim as a treatment for the patient's bacteremia. Option E is also false as D&C procedure was a part of her past history and not directly related to the bacteremia treatment."
71,2,18941727,What was the patient's Hematocrit level upon discharge during her first admission?,Patient's Hct was 23.4 during discharge.,Patient's Hct was 23.8 during discharge.,Patient's Hct was 25.3 during discharge.,Patient's Hct was 28.5 during discharge.,Patient's Hct was 26.2 during discharge.,C,"During the first hospital stay, the patient's Hct was gradually improving, as indicated by the sequence of Hct values listed in the observation - Hct-17.4*, Hct-23.3*, Hct-24.2*, Hct-25.0*, Hct-25.3*, Hct-28.4*. The levels were steadily increasing, with the last recorded Hct level being 28.4 before she was discharged, indicating that the Hct level must have been close to or above this mark upon discharge. Answer option C, corresponding to a Hct level of 25.3, is the correct choice by this reasoning.   The other choices are not correct as per this reasoning, despite being values recorded for the patient during her first admission. They serve as good distractors because they were recorded at different points in time before the discharge. For example, B: 23.8 was the Hct level when she was first brought into the Emergency Department, not at the time of discharge. Similarly, D: 28.5 was her Hct level upon admission during her second hospital stay, not at the time of discharge from her first admission. Therefore, despite being actual Hct values for the patient, they do not answer the question correctly but serve as good distractors. The options A and E are completely invented and have no connection to any data in the patient's file."
72,2,19134551,"How many surgical procedures did the patient undergo, and what were these procedures?","The patient underwent one surgical procedure, which was a distal tibia fracture to his right leg.","The patient underwent two surgical procedures, which were external fixator placement to the right lower extremity and removal of this external fixator followed by the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of the right distal tibia.","The patient underwent one surgical procedure, which was a physical therapy to improve strength and mobility.","The patient underwent two surgical procedures, which were a distal tibia fracture to his right leg and a physical therapy to improve strength and mobility.","The patient underwent one surgical procedure, which was removal of the external fixator followed by an open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of the right distal tibia.",B,"The patient's Medical records in note 1 and note 2 indicate that he underwent two surgeries. In note 1, it's mentioned that the patient underwent an External fixator placement to the right lower extremity due to a fall from a ladder. Then in note 2, the patient had the External fixator removed, and an Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) was performed on his right distal tibia. None of the other choices mention both procedures, which makes them incorrect, although some of them, particularly choices A and E, are partially correct as they each mention one of the procedures. Physical therapy is not a surgical procedure so the Choices C and D are incorrect."
73,2,15935989,What is the patient's medical history and has there been a change in his medication over the course of two years from 2131-02-24 to 2133-01-20?,"The patient was diagnosed with lumbar stenosis and was taking acetaminophen, docusate sodium, diazepam, oxycodone, simvastatin, irbesartan, and citalopram. Two years later, he remained on the same set of medications.","The patient was diagnosed with lumbar stenosis and was taking the medications acetaminophen, docusate sodium, diazepam, and multivitamin. Three years later, his medications included acetaminophen, Aspirin, Simvastatin, OxycoDONE and Cephalexin.","Initially, the patient had Lumbar stenosis and was prescribed medications including Diazepam and Simvastatin. After two years, the patient was found with a recurrent right lower extremity ganglion cyst and his prescription included Acetaminophen, OxycoDONE, Simvastatin, Irbesartan and Cephalexin.","The patient's initial condition was lumbar stenosis and his medications included multivitamin tablets. Two years later, there were no changes in his medications.","The patient's primary illness was lumbar stenosis, and he was on oxycodone for pain. After two years, the patient still didn't have any change in his medications.",C,"The patient was initially diagnosed with lumbar stenosis and his medications included acetaminophen, docusate sodium, diazepam, multivitamin, oxycodone, simvastatin, irbesartan, and citalopram. After two years, the patient's condition changed to recurrent right lower extremity ganglion cyst, with the medication changing to include Acetaminophen, OxycoDONE, Simvastatin, Irbesartan, Aspirin and Cephalexin. The other choices are incorrect as they indicate no change in medication or incorrect medications. Choice B mentioned three years instead of two, D and E incorrectly state that there was no change in medication, and A incorrectly states that the patient remained on the same set of medications."
74,2,14135333,"Did the patient have any complications identified post-procedure for the removal of the malpositioned cervical hardware, and how were they managed?","The patient experienced significant complications, including difficulty in moving his arm and the involvement of a rotator cuff injury.","The patient developed a high-grade fever and extensive fluid discharge from the surgical site, which was managed with antibiotic therapy and monitoring of the wound.",There were no complications identified post-procedure.,The patient acquired an infection following the procedure which required intensive antibiotic care and wound healing strategies.,The patient had difficulty in urinating requiring a straight catheter but was later able to urinate spontaneously.,E,"After the removal of the malpositioned cervical hardware, the patient experienced incomplete voiding, which required the use of a straight catheter. However, the issue was resolved as he was later able to urinate spontaneously. This is indicated in note 2. Although option B mentions complications, it is true for the first surgical procedure as mentioned in note 1, rather than the hardware removal mentioned in note 2. Similarly, although post-surgical infections are a valid concern, note 2 describes the incision as ""clean, dry and intact without evidence of infection"". The patient did have persistent symptoms in his right upper extremity, as stated in option A, but they were pre-existing problems from before the hardware removal; these were not postoperative complications. Option C is incorrect as there was a complication in the form of incomplete voiding, as mentioned."
75,2,15104693,What major surgeries did the patient undergo and what was the root cause for these procedures?,The patient underwent a kidney transplant due to renal failure.,"The patient had a surgical procedure on C5-6, C6-7 due to cervical stenosis.",The patient had wrist surgery due to carpal tunnel syndrome.,The patient had a gastric bypass surgery due to obesity.,The patient went for Left L4-5 Hemilaminectomy/Discectomy due to left L4-5 lumbar stenosis.,B,"Based on the notes provided, the patient underwent two major surgical procedures. Firstly, a surgery on C5-6, C6-7 as mentioned in first note that was necessitated due to cervical stenosis, and secondly, another surgery which was Left L4-5 Hemilaminectomy/Discectomy necessitated due to left L4-5 lumbar stenosis as mentioned in the second note.   The other options A, C, D are incorrect because they do not mention any of the surgeries and conditions that were stated in the notes. These are good distractors as they involve other medical procedures and conditions, making them plausible yet incorrect answers."
76,2,13452600,What were the results of lab tests after the first surgical procedure and how did they compare with the lab results after the second surgical procedure?,The patient's WBC count decreased after the second surgery.,The patient's Glucose level increased after the second surgery.,The patient's ALT level was lower after the second surgery in comparison to the first surgery.,The patient's RDW level increased after the second surgery.,The patient's Hgb level remained the same after both surgeries.,C,"In the first note, it is mentioned that the ALT level was at 45* after the first surgery. After the second surgery, note 2 shows that the ALT level dropped to 23 which is lower than the previous test. Therefore, the correct answer is C.  Option A is incorrect because the WBC count increased (from 7.1 in the first note to 9.8 in the second note) after the second surgery. Option B is wrong because the Glucose level showed a small increase (from 93 in the first note to 96 in the second note). Option D is also incorrect because the RDW level decreased (from 18.2* in the first note to 13.9 in the second note) after the second procedure. Finally, option E is incorrect because the Hgb level decreased (from 12.7 in the first note to 11.3 in the second note) after the second surgery."
77,2,11625331,What was the prescribed medication and dosage for the patient to manage pain post thyroidectomy?,"Insulin Humalog, 4 units at breakfast, 3 units at lunch and dinner.","Acetaminophen 650 mg, orally every six hours as needed for pain and fever.",IV Hydralazine for severe range BPs and required no further anti-hypertensives agents.,"Oral pain medications, without specification of type or dosage.","Ibuprofen 400 mg, orally every six hours as needed for mild pain.",B,"According to the information from the discharge summary, the patient was prescribed Acetaminophen 650 mg orally every six hours prn (according to need) to manage pain post thyroidectomy. This makes Answer B the correct choice. While the other options do indicate various treatments the patient was under, they either concern situations unrelated to the thyroidectomy procedure (such as A and C referencing insulin for diabetes and IV Hydralazine for blood pressure respectively) or are not sufficient in their details (as is the case for option D). Option E is incorrect because although the patient was prescribed Ibuprofen 400 mg orally, this was for mild pain, not specific to post thyroidectomy management, which makes option B more appropriate."
78,2,10824981,"What were the critical events in the patient's medical history, regarding her quad pregnancy, up until her admission on 2185-04-06?",The patient had a consistent history of anemia and PICC line infections related to her pregnancy.,"The patient was diagnosed with Right flank pain and quad pregnancy, had left ovarian torsion, and was admitted for right-sided persistent flank attributed to right hemorrhage cyst.","The patient had a miscarriage around 7 weeks gestation, was re-hospitalized multiple times for pain management, and was on a PO regular diet.","The patient experienced quad ectopic pregnancy, which resulted in surgical intervention.","The patient has a history of gestational diabetes, which was managed through a controlled diet during her quad pregnancy.",B,"The correct answer is B. The patient's medical history prior to her admission on 2185-04-06 as per the discharge summary included diagnosis with Right flank pain and quad pregnancy, had left ovarian torsion, and was admitted for right-sided persistent flank attributed most likely secondary to right hemorrhage cyst.  Answer A is incorrect because nothing in the discharge summary mentioned anemia or PICC line infections.  Answer C is incorrect because even though the patient was hospitalized for pain management, there was no mention of a miscarriage around 7 weeks gestation.  Answer D is incorrect because there wasn't any ectopic pregnancy diagnosis or surgical intervention due to such. Answer E is incorrect because there is no mention in the discharge report about the patient having gestational diabetes."
79,2,10862401,What significant surgical intervention was performed in the patient's first diagnosis and what was the reason for it?,Open appendectomy was performed due to appendix rupture.,Hysteroscopic uterine septum resection was performed due to heterotopic pregnancy.,"Diagnostic laparoscopy, laparotomy, and excision of left cornual/adnexal heterotopic pregnancy were performed due to heterotopic pregnancy.",Cesarean delivery was performed due to atypical proteinuria.,Surgery was performed to treat her moderate left lower quadrant pain.,C,"The correct answer is C, as it's mentioned in the first clinical note that a diagnostic laparoscopy, laparotomy, and excision of a left cornual/adnexal heterotopic pregnancy were performed. The reason for this was a heterotopic pregnancy which the patient presented with. On the other hand, options A and B, while they constitute significant surgical procedures that the patient underwent in the past, they are not connected to the heterotopic pregnancy that is central to the question. Option D talks about a surgery that is taken from another clinical note referring to a different hospital stay and illness. Lastly, option E is incorrect because although left lower quadrant pain was mentioned in the notes, it wasn't the reason for a surgical intervention. Instead, it was a symptom that the patient presented with."
80,2,17653194,What was the outcome and primary reason for the patient's subsequent admission after the initial Microvascular Decompression of Trigeminal Nerve?,The patient underwent a second Microvascular Decompression of Trigeminal Nerve due constant left sided trigeminal nerve pain.,"The patient was admitted for undergoing routine medical checkup, following the Microvascular Decompression of Trigeminal Nerve.",The patient was admitted because of a protrusion and pain from the mesh used in a previous cranioplasty procedure.,The patient was admitted due to an increase dose of her ongoing medication treatment and routine checkup.,The patient had to undergo a cholecystectomy after the initial surgery.,C,"After the initial Microvascular Decompression of Trigeminal Nerve, the patient was subsequently admitted for a revision cranioplasty, caused by pain and protrusion from the mesh used in a previous cranioplasty procedure. Options A, B, D, and E, while containing accurate information from the patient's record, are not the primary reasons for her subsequent admission. Specifically: option A - the patient didn't undergo a second Microvascular Decompression of Trigeminal Nerve; option B - the patient was not admitted for a routine checkup; option D - the patient's medication was not the cause for readmission; option E - There is mention of a past cholecystectomy, but it was not a reason for her subsequent hospital admittance."
81,2,11640892,What antibiotics was the patient given around the time of the Incision and Drainage procedure in his second hospital visit and for what duration?,The patient was given Vancomycin for a 4 week period.,"The patient was given IV Vancomycin and Zosyn, duration unspecified.","The patient was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed, duration unspecified.",The patient was given Augmentin for ten days.,The patient was not given any antibiotics during his second hospital visit.,D,"In note 2, which reflects the patient's second hospital visit, it was reported that the patient was prescribed Augmentin for ten days following his toe I&D procedure. While option A and B depicts the use of Vancomycin and Zosyn, those antibiotics were used during the patient's first hospitalization as depicted in note 1, and not around the time of the I&D procedure in the second hospital visit. Option C mentions Oxycodone-Acetaminophen, which is a pain medication, not an antibiotic. Finally, option E is not correct because the patient was prescribed an antibiotic (Augmentin) during his second hospital visit."
82,2,13754131,What was the medical and surgical management plan for the patient's right tibial plateau fracture?,"The patient was administered Lisinopril and Verapamil, without any surgical intervention.","The patient was given ativan, haldol, and hydralazine due to his alcohol withdrawal symptoms, without any surgical treatment for his right tibial plateau fracture.",The patient underwent Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) of his right tibial plateau fracture and was then followed with a regimen of physical therapy and pain management with IV pain killers and subsequently Oxycodone.,"The patient was treated with ativan and haldol as well as hydralazine due to alcohol withdrawal, and physical therapy was instituted for recovery.","The right tibial plateau fracture was treated with a fibular allograft, and the patient was put on a physical therapy program postoperatively.",C,"The correct answer is C because in note 2, it is mentioned that the patient was admitted with a right tibial plateau fracture and was then surgically treated using Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF). Postoperatively, the patient's pain was managed with IV pain medications, and then he was transitioned to Oxycodone. He was also put on a physical therapy regimen to manage the fracture effectively. The other options, A, B, D, and E, are incorrect because even though they mention elements present in the patient notes, they do not provide a comprehensive management plan for the patient's specific issue of the right tibial plateau fracture."
83,2,15150586,What was the symptom that recurred for the patient warranting his second visit to the hospital and how does it relate to his earlier condition?,"The patient had recurring moments of sudden dysphagia, caused by a pill that lodged in his throat.","The patient increasingly experienced severe pain in his left arm, related to his previous problems with his nerves.","The patient's difficulty in swallowing increased, attributed to a recurring lung problem.","The patient recurrently experienced mild distress, originating from the mental aspects of his past medical condition.","The patient appeared with issues related to ambulation, related to a past discharge condition.",A,"The patient's recurring symptom is explicitly stated as ""dysphagia"", specifically, difficulty swallowing because he swallowed a pill that stuck in his throat which is discussed in note 2. Although options B and D do state symptoms that occurred during the patient's stay in the hospital and option C and E include contents in the note, none of them were the symptoms that caused the patient's second visit to the hospital. Hence, these options serve as good distractors."
84,2,17290439,What was the primary cause of the patient's left subtalar dislocation and right bimalleolar fracture?,Due to a vehicular accident,Part of an inherited condition,Consequence of a sports injury,Result of a fall from a ladder,Caused by a wrongly administered medical procedure,D,"The correct answer is D, ""Result of a fall from a ladder"", as indicated in the discharge summary where it is mentioned that the patient fell from a ladder resulting in a left subtalar dislocation and right bimalleolar ankle fracture. Answer choice A, ""Due to a vehicular accident"", is incorrect as there is no mention of any vehicular accident. Similarly, option B, ""Part of an inherited condition"", is not correct as there is no documentation of any inherited condition causing such injuries. Answer choice C, ""Consequence of a sports injury"", is also wrong since there is no indication of the patient being involved in sports that resulted in the stated injuries. Lastly, answer choice E, ""Caused by a wrongly administered medical procedure"" is not the correct answer as per the provided discharge summary which does not suggest that a medical procedure caused these injuries."
85,2,18595347,What was the surgical procedure the patient underwent during his second admission and what was the discharge condition?,"The patient underwent a procedure to treat right orchiectomy, and was discharged in stable condition.","The patient underwent appendectomy, and was discharged in good condition.","The patient underwent an operation for abdominal pain, and was discharged with minimal pain.","The patient underwent robotic RPLND, and was discharged with an appropriate mental status and could walk.","The patient underwent a surgery for epiploic appendagitis, and was discharged with no postoperative complications.",D,"The second admission details mention that the patient underwent a robotic Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND) due to testicular cancer (note 2). Though the patient could walk and had appropriate mental status at the time of discharge, which can be construed as being in good condition, these details were only mentioned in the second note. The other options A, B, C, and E either relate to a different admission or procedure, and hence are not correct. They were chosen as distractors because they contain information present in the discharge summary but do not answer the question correctly."
86,2,14598378,What was the status of the patient's right renal artery and its associated bypass graft at her follow-up visit?,The right renal artery was consistently flowing and working alongside the bypass graft.,Both right renal artery and bypass graft were functioning optimally.,"The right renal artery and its bypass graft were occluded, resulting in an infarcted right kidney.","The bypass graft had been removed, leaving the right renal artery functioning independently.","The right renal artery displayed signs of another aneurysm, necessitating another surgery.",C,"The notes reveal that the patient's right renal artery and the bypass graft were occluded during her follow-up visit, leading to an infarcted right kidney, as mentioned in note 2. This malady is also referred to as the loss of organ function because it was not supplied with fresh blood. Option C is the correct answer. Although options A, B, D, and E reference the right renal artery or associate it with a graft, which are elements of the question, these options are incorrect because they describe scenarios that did not occur in the patient's case, as her right renal artery and the graft associated with it became blocked."
87,2,17188171,What medication was prescribed to the patient to control his pain after the C4-C7 cervical decompression and posterior spinal fusion procedure and how often should it be administered?,Acetaminophen 325 mg every 6 hours,Oxycodone 5 mg every 3 hours,Oxycodone 10 mg every 12 hours,Docusate Sodium 100 mg two times a day,Diazepam 5 mg every 6 hours,C,"From the medication list specified in note 2, Oxycodone 10 mg every 12 hours was prescribed specifically after the C4-C7 cervical decompression and posterior spinal fusion procedure for pain control. Diazepam (Choice E) was prescribed for spasms, not pain control. Oxycodone 5 mg every 3 hours (Choice B) and Acetaminophen 325 mg tablet every 6 hours (Choice A) were given, but not specifically for post-procedure pain. Docusate Sodium (Choice D) is not a pain medication and was not prescribed for pain."
88,2,15467096,What were the infections that the patient was diagnosed with during her recent trips to the hospital for her pregnancy and post-partum period?,The patient was diagnosed with an urinary tract infection and mastitis.,The patient contracted influenza and mumps during her hospital stay.,The patient was treated for bacterial pneumonia and staphylococcus infection.,The patient had a urinary tract infection and streptococcal pharyngitis.,The patient acquired mononucleosis and candidiasis.,A,"In the second note, it is mentioned that the patient was treated for a urinary tract infection (""Urine cultures grew gram negative rods and patient was started on macrobid for her UTI."") and mastitis (""bilateral mastitis s/p 7d diclox""). The correct answer paraphrases this without using the exact lines from the notes.   B is incorrect because the notes do not mention the patient having the flu or mumps. C is incorrect as there's no information in the notes about bacterial pneumonia and no direct reference to a staphylococcus infection. D is incorrect because the patient did not have streptococcal pharyngitis. E is incorrect because the notes do not mention mononucleosis and candidiasis. These all serve as good distractors because they are plausible infections a patient could have during or after pregnancy."
89,2,15322087,"Did the patient have recurrent bleeding after discharge from his first hospital visit and if so, what was the treatment provided for this incident?",The patient did not experience any bleeding after being discharged from the first hospital visit.,"Yes, the patient had recurrent bleeding and was treated with a soft diet and pain medication.",The patient did report recurrent bleeding and underwent a second tonsillectomy.,The patient experienced recurrent bleeding which was controlled through cauterization of the right tonsillar mid-pole.,"Yes, the patient experienced a recurrence of bleeding and was readmitted for observation only.",D,"In the second note, it states that the patient experienced recurrent bleeding from his tonsils one day after being discharged from the first hospital visit. This was controlled using cauterization at the mid-pole of the right tonsil. The patient was then kept for observation before being discharged without any further event. Option A is incorrect because the patient did experience recurrent bleeding. Option B is incorrect as a soft diet and pain medication were used in response to the initial bleeding incident, but was not the treatment for the second bleeding occurrence. Option C is incorrect as the patient underwent a cauterization procedure, not a second tonsillectomy. Option E is incorrect as the patient was not only observed, but also underwent a treatment procedure."
90,2,16866071,What was the primary diagnosis and the surgical procedure performed to manage the patient's condition during the hospital visits?,The primary diagnosis was nausea and vomiting and the patient underwent dental surgery.,The principal diagnosis was morphine and zofran toxicity and the corrective procedure was a zofran detox.,The prevalent diagnosis was anemia and the patient underwent surgical tooth extraction.,The primary diagnosis was Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and the patient underwent paracentesis.,The chief diagnosis was ascites and the patient underwent a catheterization procedure.,D,"From the notes, we can ascertain that the chief diagnosis during the hospital visits was Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). The surgical procedure performed to manage the patient's condition was paracentesis multiple times to drain ascites. The other options are not correct because:  - Option A) Nausea and Vomiting was a symptom presented by the patient but not the primary diagnosis, and Dental surgery was a previous surgical history but not a procedure performed during the hospital visits.  - Option B) Morphine and Zofran toxicity was not mentioned as a diagnosis, and the patient was actually given these medications to manage her symptoms.  - Option C) Anemia was a part of the patient's medical history but not a diagnosis during the hospital visits, and surgical tooth extraction is not mentioned in the notes. - Option E) Ascites was noted as a symptom and health issue, but not the direct diagnosis, and catheterization is not a procedure performed during this hospital visit for this patient."
91,2,10451518,What invasive procedures were performed to treat the patient's open left ankle fracture and what was his expected post-discharge course and precautions?,The patient underwent a hernia surgery for his ankle fracture. After discharge he was prescribed to ingest acetaminophen and was advised to avoid baths or swimming for at least four weeks.,"Procedures performed for the patient's ankle fracture were I&D, ORIF, posterior tib tendon repair, and the removal of ex-fix. His special instructions after discharge included continuity of home medications, weight bearing precautions, taking lovenox daily for 3 weeks, and a 4-week prohibition on baths and swimming.","The patient received I&D, ex-fix, ORIF, and a rotator cuff repair for his open ankle fracture. After discharge, he was advised to continue medications prescribed by the physician and to commence normal activities as tolerated.","The patient underwent an ORIF for his left ankle fracture which was complemented with a hernia surgery. His discharge advice included taking oxycodone and was also directed to avoid drinking alcohol, operating machinery, or driving.","A laparoscopy was carried out to treat the patient's open left ankle fracture. He was told to avoid machine operation, driving, and consuming alcohol due to his prescribed use of narcotic pain relievers following his discharge.",B,"Based on the hospital's notes, the patient initially underwent I&D, ex-fix, and ORIF treatments in addition to a posterior tib tendon repair to treat his open left ankle fracture (note 1). He underwent the removal of the ex-fix and an ORIF for his fibula for continued treatment of his ankle fracture (note 2). After his discharge, the patient was expected to follow weight bearing precautions and continue all consumption of home medications. The patient was also advised to avoid baths and swimming for about 4 weeks. Answer B is the most accurate as it includes all these details. Other choices are incorrect as they either do not accurately mention all the procedures performed to treat the patient's ankle fracture accoriding to the provided summaries (A, C, D, E) and/or provide incorrect post-discharge course and precautions."
92,2,14722883,What was the cause of the patient's urosepsis after the ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy as stated in the note charted on 2168-12-14?,The patient's urosepsis was due to severe abdominal pain following the procedure.,The urosepsis was triggered by an allergic reaction to the drugs used during the procedure.,The urosepsis was an effect of a complication in placing a wire up the patient's ureter during the ureteroscopy.,The patient's urosepsis resulted from an infection with the bacterial species Enterococcus in their urinary system.,The urosepsis was caused by failing to administer antibiotics after the ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy procedures.,D,"The discharge summary in the second note charted on 2168-12-14 cites urosepsis following ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy, with the urine culture testing positive for Enterococcus. This indicates that the urosepsis was due to an Enterococcus infection (Choice D). The summary does not indicate that the urosepsis was due to severe abdominal pain (Choice A), allergic reactions to drugs (Choice B), complications with placing the wire up the ureter (Choice C), or lack of administering antibiotics (Choice E) post-procedure. However, these irrelevant pieces of the patient's medical history and condition may potentially confuse someone who does not properly interpret the medical notes."
93,2,18300046,What was the patient's diagnosis and condition upon discharge during her second visit compared to her first?,The patient had a vaginal delivery due to advanced cervical dilation during both visits and was subsequently discharged.,"During the second visit, the patient experienced preterm contractions that subsided, while she underwent vaginal delivery due to advanced cervical dilation on her first visit.",The patient had a liveborn male during her second visit while she experienced abruption during her first visit.,"The patient was in a state of depression during the second visit, while she had a straightforward vaginal delivery during her first visit.","During the first visit, the patient had preterm contractions that improved while she had a vaginal birth during the second visit.",B,"The correct answer is that during the first visit, the patient underwent vaginal delivery due to advanced cervical dilation, while during her second visit she had preterm contractions that stabilized. The incorrect options are good distractors. Option A is incorrect because the patient did not undergo vaginal delivery during the second visit. Option C is not accurate since she delivered a baby during her first visit, not the second, and she did not experience abruption during the second visit. Option D is incorrect as there is no indication that the patient was depressed during either visit. And finally, option E reverses the events of her two visits."
94,2,16543178,"What is the clinical history of abdominal trauma that this patient experienced during her previous pregnancies, and how were they managed?","The patient experienced abdominal trauma during her third pregnancy, managed with bed rest and analgesics.","The patient had two occurrences of abdominal trauma in her previous pregnancies due to domestic violence and altercations, managed with observation, administration of anti-nausea medication, pain relief, and the arrangement of safe locations.","The patient experienced abdominal trauma due to a car accident in her first pregnancy, managed with surgery.","The patient had a severe abdominal trauma due to a fall during her fourth pregnancy, treated with surgery.","The patient had frequent episodes of abdominal trauma caused by genealogical complications, managed with regular check-ups and mild analgesics.",B,"The correct answer is B because it accurately captures the patient's history of abdominal trauma as mentioned in the discharge summaries. The patient experienced trauma in her abdomen during her pregnancies due to violent confrontations, managed with monitoring, medication to control nausea, relief from pain, and transfer to safe environments. The other options are incorrect. They either involve situations not outlined in the discharge summaries like a car accident (C), surgery (C and D), frequent traumas from genealogical complications (E), or are not complete as they detail only one instance of trauma (A)."
95,2,18467824,What was the reason for the patient's second admission to the hospital shortly after the first discharge?,A stage II breast carcinoma post right lumpectomy was noted.,The patient needed a follow up on her incision from the right axillary lymph node dissection.,The patient was under respiratory distress.,The patient was experiencing bleeding from the right breast's JP drain site.,The need to transition the patient from IV pain medication to oral pain medication.,D,"The notes from the second admission directly state that the chief complaint from the patient was bleeding from the site of her JP drain in her right breast post-discharge from her first hospital admission.  Option A is incorrect as it pertains to the cause for the first admission. Option B is incorrect as there is no specific mention of this in the second admission. Option C is an incorrect statement as the notes mention that the patient did not encounter any respiratory issues. Option E is incorrect as it pertains to care administered during the first hospital stay. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer as it directly addresses the doctor's question on the cause for the second admission."
96,2,13653594,What medication was prescribed to the patient for her Post-partum hypertension condition?,The patient was prescribed Prenatal Vitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY for her Post-partum hypertension condition.,The patient was given 3 doses of IV Labetalol 20mg-40mg-80mg to manage her Post-partum hypertension condition.,The patient was prescribed nifedipine 30mg CR daily for her Post-partum hypertension condition.,The patient was prescribed Ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q6H:PRN Pain for her Post-partum hypertension condition.,The patient was prescribed Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN Pain for her Post-partum hypertension condition.,C,"This question asks which medication was prescribed to the patient for her Post-partum hypertension. According to information from note 1, the patient was prescribed Nifedipine CR 30 mg PO BID which is rephrased in choice C as 'nifedipine 30mg CR daily'.   Option A is incorrect because prenatal vitamins are not a treatment for hypertension. Option B is incorrect, as although Labetalol IV is used to help bring down unusually high blood pressure, it's not the ongoing medication the patient was discharged with for hypertension. Option D is incorrect as it's a pain patent’s medication, not for hypertension. Option E is incorrect as it's stated in note 2 as a discharge medication for pain, not for postpartum hypertension. All the incorrect options are good distractors as they were all given to the patient but not for her hypertension condition."
97,2,14722497,"Given the patient's history with intentional overdose, what changes were made to her medication regimen to ensure her safety?",The dosage of Prozac was increased.,Dilaudid was given on discharge.,Her medication Lorazepam was ceased to prevent further overdose incidents.,Venlafaxine was added to her medication list.,The dosage of Venlafaxine was reduced on discharge.,C,"The patient intentionally overdosed on Ativan, a form of Lorazepam. For the patient's safety, the medication Lorazepam was discontinued to prevent another occurrence. While medications were changed between her two admissions, none of the other options accurately describe a change made for the patient’s safety. Prozac was not increased, Dilaudid given on discharge does not indicate a safety precaution, Venlafaxine was not newly added but continued, and the dosage of Venlafaxine was reduced, but not directly related to the overdose incident making them good distractors."
98,2,15596990,"What was the final treatment decision, based on diagnosis, for managing the patient's multiple sclerosis flare and related urinary retention during and after her pregnancy?",Patient was administered steroidal treatment.,Patient was provided IgG therapy for 5 days.,Patient underwent insulin therapy for gestational diabetes.,Patient was administered prenatal vitamins.,Intravenous medication was administered to manage the symptoms.,B,"The discharge summarises that the patient had an incidence of multiple sclerosis flare and related urinary retention during her pregnancy. The therapeutic decision made was to continue the IgG therapy for an additional 3 days, totaling 5 days, to help treat the present MS flare. While the patient was indeed administered steroidal treatment and prenatal vitamins, choices A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they did not specifically address the MS flare and urinary retention issue, making choice B the correct answer."
99,2,13469257,What was the primary presenting symptom that led to the patient's second admission to the hospital?,Evidence of peritonitis,Large decrease in bowel movements,Nausea and emesis,Appendectomy scar inflammation,Sudden onset of pain radiating to RLQ at appendectomy scar,C,"According to the second note, the patient's primary presenting symptom that led to his second admission to the hospital was ‘abdominal pain’ which later was accompanied by ‘nausea and emesis’ (Considered as one symptom as it is linked as a result of abdominal pain). Option 'A' is incorrect because the physical exams in both instances showed no evidence of peritonitis. Option 'B' is untrue as both notes indicate that the patient had bowel movements the previous day, but the movements decreased as the day progressed. While an appendectomy scar is mentioned in both notes, there is no indication that inflammation of this scar was a primary presenting symptom which means Option 'D' is incorrect. Option 'E' pertains to the first admission where pain was gradual and specified to radiate to RLQ at appendectomy scar leading to confusion, but not the second one."
100,2,14008721,"What were the discharge medications given to the patient during his hospital visit on March 21, 2123 and on May 5, 2123, and what were they intended for?","March 21, 2123: Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Nicotine Patch, Oxycodone-Acetaminophen. May 5, 2123: Gabapentin, Ibuprofen, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Doxycycline Hyclate.","March 21, 2123: Duricef, Bactrim, Nicotine Patch.

May 5, 2123: Gabapentin, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Doxycycline Hyclate.","March 21, 2123: Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Nicotine Patch, Oxycodone-Acetaminophen. May 5, 2123: Neurontin, Gabapentin, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Doxycycline Hyclate.",A,"In the discharge summaries, it is clearly mentioned that on March 21, 2123, the patient was discharged with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole for infection, Nicotine Patch for substance abuse, and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for pain management. On May 5, 2123, the patient was discharged with Gabapentin (Neurontin), Ibuprofen for pain, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole and Doxycycline Hyclate for persistent MRSA hand infection. The other choices are incorrect due to the mention of Duricef and Bactrim which the patient took before the March 21, 2123 hospitalization, not as discharge medications, and incorrect reference to Neurontin, which was a medication on admission on May 5, 2123, not a discharge medication."
101,2,10472926,What was the patient's primary complaint during his second admission and what was the major surgical procedure performed?,The patient complained of a table saw injury and he underwent a complex repair wound.,"The patient's main problem was an extensor tendon laceration, and the performed procedure was repair of extensor tendon on the right hand.",The patient complained about an anxiety disorder and had a surgery for the same.,"The patient's primary complaint was infection in his right hand, and the primary procedure performed was incision and drainage.","The main issue for the patient was partial amputation of right digits, and the doctor performed a surgery to repair the same.",D,"During the patient's second admission, according to note 2, the patient's chief complaint was an infection in the right hand. The major surgical or invasive procedure undertaken during this admission was incision and drainage (I&D) as stated in the ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure"" section. Option A, B, C and E mentioned chief complaints and procedures during the first admission."
102,2,13427671,"What was the type of delivery method used during the patient's most recent childbirth, and what was the infant's health condition post-delivery?","The patient experienced an uncomplicated delivery through vaginal birth, and the infant had a normal Apgar score of 10.",The patient underwent a primary high transverse cesarean section with the infant showing signs of respiratory distress.,"The patient delivered a breech baby through a scheduled cesarean section that concluded without complications, with her infant returning Apgar scores of 8 and 9. ","The patient had a high-risk delivery due to placental abruption, hence the need for an emergency cesarean section; the infant was admitted to the NICU due to prematurity.","The patient experienced delivery facilitated by vacuum extraction, with the infant appearing healthy and with good Apgar scores.",C,"The correct answer is found in note 2 where it indicates that the patient underwent a scheduled primary low transverse cesarean section and delivered a breech baby. The infant's Apgar score was 8 and 9, which denotes a healthy new-born. Options A and E are incorrect as the delivery was a planned cesarean section, not a vaginal birth or vacuum extraction. Option B and D are also incorrect as the patient had an uncomplicated cesarean section, not a high transverse one, and there's no note of the baby showing signs of respiratory distress or being admitted to the NICU due to prematurity. The distractors are chosen for their relevance to the topic of delivery methods and infant health post-delivery."
103,2,15777028,"What surgical procedures did the patient undergo and when, according to their medical history?",The patient underwent a Laparoscopic Sigmoid colectomy but the date is not specified.,The patient underwent a C67 ACDF but the date is not specified.,The patient had a Laparoscopic Sigmoid colectomy and a C67 ACDF without any specific dates.,"The patient was given a PCA and a bupivicane pain pump as part of a surgical procedure, no specific dates given.","The patient underwent surgery for hypertension and a radial/ulnar fracture, no specific dates provided.",C,"Based on the two notes, it is clear that the patient underwent two main surgical procedures, a Laparoscopic Sigmoid colectomy ( from note 1) and a C67 ACDF (from note 2). However, specific dates for these procedures were not provided in the notes. Option A and B are only half correct, they mentioned only one procedure each. Option D and E are incorrect because PCA (Patient-controlled Analgesia) and bupivicane pain pump are methods of controlling pain, not surgical procedures. Hypertension and radial/ulnar fracture are illnesses and conditions, which may necessitate procedures, but the procedures are not explicitly stated."
104,2,16847952,What was the surgical procedure the patient underwent in the first visit to the hospital and what was the major complaint in the second visit?,Underwent hysterectomy and complained about chest pains during the second visit,"Had a breast reduction, and the chief complaint was a migraine during the second visit",Conducted a dilation and curettage procedure and subsequently complained about dizziness,Underwent a low tranverse C-section and complained about fever and abdominal pain later,Oral surgery was performed and complained about joint pain during the second visit,D,"The low tranverse C-section as one of the major surgical or invasive procedure the patient underwent during the first visit is mentioned in the first note. Similarly, during the patient's second visit, her primary complaint was fever and abdominal pain, as described in the second note. Options A, B, C and E cannot be the right answer as they either have an incorrect surgical procedure or the complaint in the second visit or both. In case of A, hysterectomy is not mentioned anywhere in the notes; B describes breast reduction which was part of the patient's surgical history, however, the chief complaint was not a migraine; In C, the dilation and curettage procedure is from the second visit and the chief complaint of dizziness is not correct; and finally, E also mentions an incorrect surgical procedure from the patient's surgical history and an inaccurate symptom during the second visit."
105,2,14402245,What was the primary reason for the patient's readmission after her late term Cesarean section and what was the treatment followed?,The patient was readmitted due to vaginal bleeding and was treated with prenatal vitamins and iron supplements.,"The main reason for the patient's readmission was fever caused by endometritis postpartum, and she was treated with intravenous gentamicin and clidamycin.",The patient was readmitted due to marginal placenta previa and was treated by observation and administering a course of betamethasone.,"The readmission was due to persistent marginal previa, and the treatment involved bedrest and close outpatient follow-up.","The patient was readmitted due to complications from the late-term Cesarean section, with the treatment being prenatal vitamins and iron supplements.",B,"In note 2, it is clearly mentioned that the patient was readmitted 15 days after a late-term Cesarean section due to a fever caused by endometritis postpartum. The treatment followed was intravenous gentamicin and clidamycin until 48 hours afebrile.   Option A is incorrect because while vaginal bleeding was a complaint during the first admission, it was not the cause of the readmission. Similarly, options C and D are incorrect because even though marginal placenta previa was a diagnosis during the first admission, it was not the reason for the second admission. Option E is incorrect as the complications from the Cesarean section are not specified and the treatment mentioned (prenatal vitamins and iron supplements) does not match what was given during the readmission."
106,2,18532845,What is the difference in patient's allergy status as observed between the discharges on 2168-12-16 and 2169-10-22?,"There is no difference, the patient's allergies remained the same.",The patient developed an allergy to Vitamin E. ,The patient developed allergies to Tylenol and Percocet.,The patient is no longer allergic to Bactrim Ds.,The patient no longer shows allergic reactions to any medications.,C,"The discharge summary from 2168-12-16 states that the patient is allergic to Bactrim Ds only. However, the discharge summary from 2169-10-22 reports that the patient is allergic to Bactrim Ds, Tylenol, and Percocet. This indicates that between the two discharge dates, the patient developed allergies to Tylenol and Percocet.   Option A is a distractor because it suggests that the allergies didn't change, which is incorrect. Option B is a distractor because while Vitamin E is mentioned in the first summary (as part of admission medications), there is no indication that the patient developed an allergy to it. Option D is incorrect because the patient remains allergic to Bactrim Ds in the second summary. Option E is incorrect because the patient report at the later date (2169-10-22) reveals new allergies rather than a reduction or removal of allergies."
107,2,10439532,What was the most recent surgical intervention the patient underwent and how was it related to his previous diagnosis?,The most recent surgical process was the injection of an epidural steroid in connection with his chronic back pain.,"The patient most recently had bilateral eye surgery, linked to an unidentified condition related to his vision.","The most recent surgical intervention involved a left laminotomy and discectomy at L5S1, which is associated with a previously diagnosed recurrent disc herniation at L5S1.",The patient's latest surgery was an intervention for his stand stability issues which were triggered by numbness of his left footsole.,"The most recent surgical procedure was for chronic low back pain, which was treated through a general surgical procedure.",C,"The notes indicate that the patient's most recent surgical intervention was indeed a ""left laminotomy and discectomy at L5S1"" (note 2). This operation was related to the patient's previous diagnosis of ""recurrent disc herniation at L5S1"" (note 2).   Option A is incorrect, because while the patient did receive epidural steroid injections, mentioned in note 1, this is not considered a surgical procedure. Option B is also incorrect as while the patient had bilateral eye surgery in the past, it was not the most recent surgery. Option D is incorrect as there is no evidence of a surgical procedure specifically addressing foot or stability issues. Option E is incorrect as the phrase ""a general surgical procedure"" is too vague and non-specific to represent the actual procedure the patient underwent."
108,2,14492956,"What changes were made in the patient's medication between her first and second hospital visits, and for what reason?","During the second visit, the patient was prescribed a higher dosage of acetaminophen for pain control.",The patient was prescribed morphine instead of oxycodone for pain management because of increased flank pain during the second visit.,Tolterodine and Fluconazole were introduced during the second visit due to the patient’s UTI condition.,Tamsulosin was discontinued during the second visit to reduce the side effects.,Docusate Sodium was replaced by Senna to improve bowel movements during the second visit.,B,"During the second visit, the patient required stronger pain management and was therefore prescribed Morphine (choice B), replacing Oxycodone from the first visit. This answer is correct as the information from the report supports this change. Choices A and E are incorrect because the doses of Acetaminophen and Docusate Sodium did not change across the two visits. Choice D is incorrect as Tamsulosin was not discontinued but continued during the second visit. Choice C is a potential distractor because, while Tolterodine and Fluconazole were introduced during the second visit, they are not used for UTI (the patient's UTI was treated with Bactrim), making it incorrect."
109,2,11325182,What were the surgical procedures conducted on the patient due to abdominal pain during a previous admission and what was the discharge condition of the patient after these procedures?,"The surgical procedures conducted on the patient were exploratory laparoscopy, appendectomy, and knee arthroscopy. The patient was discharged in a coherent and alert state, able to move independently.","An intramedullary rod placement in the left femur was conducted due to abdominal pain. Upon discharge, the patient was stable.","A laparoscopy, retroperitoneal pericaval lymph node removal, laparoscopic appendectomy, lysis of adhesions, and pelvic inflammatory process culture and biopsy were the surgical procedures. The patient was discharged in an alert and interactive state, and was ambulatory independently.","The patient underwent a knee arthroscopy due to abdominal pain. After the procedure, she was stable upon discharge.",The patient underwent extensive lysis of adhesions and pelvic inflammatory process culture and biopsy due to abdominal pain. The patient was discharged with a clear and coherent mental status and was ambulatory independently.,C,"The correct surgical procedures that were conducted due to the patient's abdominal pain include an exploratory laparoscopy, retroperitoneal pericaval lymph node removal, a laparoscopic appendectomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, and a pelvic inflammatory process culture and biopsy (note 1). According to note 1, the patient's discharge condition was clear and coherent mentally, alert and interactive, and she was independently ambulatory. While the information in options A, D, and E does appear in the note, each of them only lists part of the procedures that were conducted. Option B lists a procedure that was performed for a different issue (note 2), not for abdominal pain. Therefore, option C is the correct answer as it includes all the procedures conducted and accurately describes the patient's discharge condition."
110,2,19514198,"What was the status of the patient's cervix at the time of admission, treatment administered and the patient's condition at the time of discharge based on the notes charted on 2199-11-22 and 2200-01-12?","The patient was admitted with a normal cervix, underwent vaginal surgery, and was discharged in a stable condition.","The patient was admitted with a dilated cervix, had been given antibiotics, and was discharged with a short cervix.","The patient was admitted with a short cervix, started on vaginal progesterone, used a pessary, and was discharged after vaginal delivery due to preterm labor.","The patient was admitted with a short cervix, was tested for bacterial vaginosis, and discharged while still having a short cervix.","The patient was admitted with a dilated cervix, received blood transfusions, and discharged after cesarean section surgery.",C,"According to the notes charted on 2199-11-22, the patient was admitted with a short cervix. The treatment administered was vaginal progesterone and a pessary. Based on the notes from 2200-01-12, the patient was discharged after having a vaginal delivery due to preterm labor. Choice A is incorrect because there was no record of vaginal surgery. Choice B is wrong because antibiotics were not administered as a treatment and the patient's cervix was not dilated at the time of admission, nor was it short at discharge. Choice D is wrong as although the patient was tested for bacterial vaginosis, this was not the primary treatment and the patient's short cervix status was resolved at the time of discharge. Choice E is incorrect because the patient was not dilated at the time of the initial admission, nor did she receive blood transfusions or undergo a cesarean section."
111,2,19554237,What procedure was conducted during the patient's second admission and why was this procedure not conducted during the first admission?,A laparoscopic appendectomy was performed to remove an inflamed appendix that burst during the first admission,The patient received IV antibiotics due to a perforated appendicitis,The patient underwent surgery for a neck lipoma,The patient was treated for abdominal pain and fever with IV fluids,A laparoscopic appendectomy was conducted due to a chronic neck lipoma,A,"During the second admission, the patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy as is reported in the discharge summary of note 2. This procedure was likely chosen due to the patient's history of perforated appendicitis, which was initially treated conservatively with antibiotics and bowel rest, as indicated in the first and second summaries. Choice A is the correct interpretation and answer to this question, as it covers both parts of the question, the procedure conducted during the second admission and why it was not conducted during the first admission.  Answer choice B, C, D, and E are incorrect, although they refer to the content of the summaries. For instance, choice B describes part of the treatment the patient received during the first admission but doesn't answer what procedure was conducted during the second admission. Similarly, choice C incorrectly associates the laparoscopic appendectomy with the patient's neck lipoma, which are unrelated. Choice D recapitulates the treatment for the first admission without addressing the procedure in the second admission. Finally, choice E incorrectly claims that the appendectomy was conducted due to a neck lipoma, which is incorrect according to the provided summaries."
112,2,13121670,How does the patient's liver hemangioma status relate to her later incident of left breast hematoma? What was the cause behind left breast hematoma?,The liver hemangioma triggered a hormonal imbalance which further led to the formation of left breast hematoma.,The surgical procedure carried out on the patient to address liver hemangioma may have indirectly resulted to the breast hematoma.,There was no direct causal relationship between liver hemangioma and left breast hematoma. The breast hematoma occurred without evident trauma.,Both the liver hemangioma and left breast hematoma were caused by the patient's known allergy to latex and epinephrine HCl.,The breast hematoma was a direct result of the liver hemangioma spreading to the breast tissues.,C,"The left breast hematoma occurred after surgery for bilateral breast reduction and was unrelated to the liver hemangioma. The notes in the patient's file suggest that the breast hematoma occurred without a known cause, specifically without any trauma (as indicated in note 2). The liver hemangioma was dealt with in a separate procedure, two years prior to the occurrence of the breast hematoma. Thus, there is no clear indication that the liver hemangioma led to the left breast hematoma. Option A infers a hormonal imbalance which is not mentioned in the notes. Option B suggests breach of surgical protocol which is not supported by the notes. Option D is incorrect as there's no mention of allergy symptoms leading to hematoma. Option E is also incorrect since hemangiomas do not spread, particularly from liver to breast."
113,2,13665972,What medical procedure was performed on the patient during her first admission and how was it addressed in the second admission?,The patient had an abdominal ultrasound procedure during the first admission and pain management was carried out in the second admission.,The patient had a pancreatic duct stent placement via ERCP during the first admission and the stent was removed during the second admission.,The patient was treated for severe nausea during the first admission and a medication review was done in the second admission.,Guided endoscopic biopsy was performed on the patient during the first admission and repeated during the second admission.,The patient was admitted for a splenectomy procedure during the first admission and received physiotherapy during the second admission.,B,"The discharge summaries provide key information about the medical procedures implemented during the patient's two admissions. On the first admission, the summary notes a procedure referred to as ""ERCP pancreatic duct stent"". In plain terms, this means an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography procedure was undertaken to place a stent in the pancreatic duct. On the patient's second admission, the medical procedure note indicates ""PD stent removal"", which means the stent placed in the pancreatic duct was removed. Although other options mention procedures or treatments that could theoretically occur in a hospital, options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they do not correctly reflect the specific procedures that took place during these particular hospital admissions."
114,2,19122146,What was the primary complaint of the patient during her second hospital visit and what procedure was conducted to manage it?,The patient had a chief complaint of chronic pelvic pain due to endometriosis and underwent an exploratory laparotomy to manage it.,The patient complained of worsening asthma symptoms for which she underwent an inhalation therapy session.,The patient suffered from stiffness in her right knee and was managed through a course of physical therapy.,The patient showed symptoms of hyperprolactinemia and was scheduled for pituitary gland surgery.,The patient was brought in due to stiff right knee and underwent a closed manipulation under anesthesia.,E,"The second hospital visit for patient according to [note 2 start] and [note 2 end] indicates her chief complaint was stiffness in her right knee. For management, she underwent a closed manipulation of the right knee under anesthesia. Option A refers to her first hospital visit in [note 1 start] to [note 1 end]. Options B, C and D are distractors based on the patient's past medical history and procedures but are not accurate in answer to the doctor's question."
115,2,11071924,What steps were taken to manage the patient's viral illness during her hospitalization on 2129-10-28? What were her discharge instructions?,The patient was given Lupron injections and was instructed to take Docusate Sodium for bowel regulation.,The patient was given Morphine and Ativan and was instructed to come back for a lumbar puncture.,"The patient was placed on ibuprofen for pain control and Tamiflu for five days at home, with instructions for self-quarantine and follow up for Swine flu test results.",The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and was instructed not to carry out strenuous activity or put anything in the vagina for six weeks.,The patient's condition was kept on close observation and she was instructed to undergo HIV testing in future.,C,"The discharge summary from 2129-10-28 shows that the patient was managed by placing her on droplet precautions, providing her with ibuprofen for pain control, and Tamiflu for the viral syndrome (choice C). The patient was also advised to self-quarantine at home and given a mask. She was further instructed to follow up on the results of her swine flu test. Choice A pertains to a separate medical issue and is from the second note. Choice B is incorrect because the patient refused a second nasal swab and there is no directive for her to return for a lumbar puncture. Choice D pertains to the second note and is about a completely different condition. Choice E is incorrect because the note mentions that the PCP may consider an HIV test in the future, but it was not an immediate discharge instruction for managing her viral illness."
116,2,13650403,"What were the major surgical or invasive procedures the patient underwent for both of his foot conditions, and what were the distinctive post-operative instructions given regarding the patient's mobility status in both instances?",The patient received a Bunionectomy on both feet and was told to avoid any weight bearing on both feet.,"The patient underwent Flatfoot Reconstruction with Cotton & Endoscopic Gastroc Recession for his right foot and a similar procedure for left foot, the post-operative instruction was to refrain from weight bearing on the operated extremities.",The patient was treated for pes planus deformity through medication and was instructed to use a walking cane for mobility.,"The patient received operative care for his obstructive sleep apnea, after which he was instructed to limit his physical activities.","The patient had surgery for his sickle cell trait condition, and he was advised to stay bed bound.",B,"According to the notes, the patient had a right foot Flatfoot Reconstruction with Cotton & Endoscopic Gastroc Recession and similar surgery for left foot as well. The aftercare instructions for both were to avoid weight bearing on the right and left lower extremities respectively. Options C, D and E are incorrect as they reference conditions or treatments not relevant to the foot conditions or instructions in question. Option A, although mentions an invasive foot procedure, it's incorrect as the patient didn't undergo bunionectomy. The instructions in option 'A' are similar but not the exact to what was indicated in the patient's actual care instructions."
117,2,17439120,What is the main reason for the patient's second admission to the hospital on 2122-12-05?,The patient was admitted due to an attack of allergic rhinitis.,The patient was admitted because of fevers and chills associated with prostatic biopsy infection and urosepsis.,The patient was admitted for prostate cancer surveillance.,The patient was admitted due to left flank pain caused by an obstructing left ureterovescical junction stone.,The patient was admitted for follow-up in the clinic after a week of discharge.,D,"The patient's second admission to the hospital on 2122-12-05 was due to acute onset left flank pain and chills associated with a 4 mm obstructing left ureterovescical junction stone. This is clearly stated in note 2.  Option A is incorrect as there is no mention of the patient having an attack of allergic rhinitis during the second admission. This is mentioned in the discharge summary as a past medical history.  Option B is incorrect as it refers to the patient's first admission to the hospital with prostatic biopsy infection and urosepsis.  Option C is not the main reason. While it's true that the patient was on active surveillance for prostate cancer, this was not the primary cause of his second hospital admission.  Option E is incorrect since it refers to a follow-up rather than the main reason for the admission."
118,2,18341323,"What were the major surgical procedures that the patient underwent, as a part of the treatment for her papillary thyroid carcinoma and which medication did the patient continue to take between the two hospital stays?","The patient underwent gallbladder removal, and continued to take pantoprazole throughout the two visits.",The patient underwent right thyroidectomy and left thyroidectomy and continued to take levothyroxine sodium between the two visits.,The patient went through knee replacement surgery and continued to take acetaminophen throughout her treatment.,The patient underwent an appendectomy and had been on a continuous intake of calcitriol.,The patient had lumpectomy and was continually prescribed oxycodone.,B,"The discharge summary specifies that the major surgeries the patient underwent were completion right thyroidectomy (denoted in note 1) and right humerus metastasectomy and reconstruction with intercalary metal prosthesis (as noted in note 2), both related to the treatment of her papillary thyroid carcinoma. Also, from the two discharge summaries, it can be observed that Levothyroxine Sodium was the medication continued to be taken by the patient. Other medications and procedures mentioned in the distractors (A, C, D, and E), such as pantoprazole, appendectomy, calcitriol, etc., are merely present in the summary but do not answer the specific question."
119,2,19931343,What were the major surgical procedures undergone by the patient on her right and left hip and what was her discharge condition post these procedures?,Patient experienced osteochondroplasty on the right hip and arthroscopy on the left hip. Her condition was considered to be recovered at the time of discharge.,The patient underwent arthroscopy procedures on both her right and left hip. Her discharge condition was stable.,The patient's left hip was subjected to surgical dislocation and acetabuloplasty while her right hip underwent arthroscopy. Her post-discharge condition was unstable.,Both the patient's right and left hips were treated through head/neck osteochondroplasty. She was released in a stable condition.,"The patient had right hip impingement s/p surgical dislocation, head-neck osteoplasty, and acetabuloplasty and left hip impingement through arthroscopy. Post these procedures, her discharge condition was improved.",E,"The patient's right hip was treated with a surgical dislocation, head-neck osteoplasty, and acetabuloplasty (as indicated in note 1). Furthermore, the left hip was treated with arthroscopy (as in note 2). The discharge condition after these procedures was improved (note 2). Option E reflects this information appropriately. The other options are incorrect as they either misrepresent the operations carried out or incorrectly suggest the patient's discharge status. However, they are sensible distractors because they all mention procedures or conditions mentioned within the notes."
120,2,10170151,What was the major issue discussed with the patient concerning her pregnancy that ultimately led to its termination during her first admission ID: 25171569 based on the note charted in 2178-04-17?,The patient had a short cervix and an anterior positioned placenta.,The pregnancy termination occurred due to a positive PPD test which required further medical evaluation.,"She had recurrent vaginal bleeding issues, most likely due to chronic placental abruption.",The fetal heart presented possible cardiologic abnormalities as visualized on certain screenings.,"There was a swift, uncomplicated delivery with minimal postpartum bleeding and a stable health state.",C,"According to the discharge summary dated on 2178-04-17, the patient experienced multiple occurrences of vaginal bleeding since approximately the tenth week. This condition is presumed to be due to chronic placental abruption and eventually led to the termination of pregnancy. Although other issues were noted (such as a short cervix, anterior placenta, possible fetal cardiac anomalies), the major concern leading to the termination was chronic placental abruption. The issue of short cervix and anterior placenta (Choice A), a positive PPD test (Choice B), and a possible cardiac anomaly in the fetus (Choice D) did not lead to the termination. The patient's previous delivery (Choice E) is not related to her first admission and hence is a wrong answer."
121,2,11662925,What kind of medical care and restrictions were prescribed to the patient after the unsuccessful obstructing ureteral calculi removal procedure and the placement of a ureteral stent?,The patient was instructed to resume rigorous activities immediately.,"The patient is allowed to bathe in a tub, swim, or soak immediately after the surgery.","The patient was asked to abstain from driving and consuming alcohol while on pain medications, restriction on heavy lifting for 4 weeks, and avoid soaking in water for 2 weeks post surgery.",The patient was encouraged to consume alcohol while taking pain medications.,The patient was asked to schedule a follow-up procedure for neurosurgery.,C,"After the ureteral calculus removal procedure and placement of a ureteral stent, the patient was prescribed certain medications (such as Acetaminophen and Oxycodone) for pain, and was given specific instructions and restrictions in lifestyle behavior to help their recovery. Option C encapsulates these points accurately, as mentioned in the discharge summary. The other options, though containing information from the summary, do not answer the question about the medical care and restrictions prescribed in context of the specific surgery. Options A, B, D relate to behaviors that the patient was specifically advised against, while E talks about a follow-up for a different procedure (neurosurgery), making them incorrect choices."
122,2,15710678,What was the change in the patient's hematocrit after receiving units of packed red blood cells during the hospitalization charted on the date 2166-03-18?,The hematocrit level decreased from 25.7 to 24.4.,Her hematocrit remained the same at 25.7.,The hematocrit level increased from 25.7 to 31.6.,"The hematocrit level first decreased to 24.4, then increased to 31.6.","The hematocrit level fluctuated between 25.7 and 31.6, ending at 25.7.",D,"When reviewing the discharge summary, it indicates that the patient's initial hematocrit was 25.7. After the first two blood transfusions, her hematocrit dropped to 24.4. After an additional 2 units of packed red blood cells, her hematocrit level was charted as 31.6. Hence, the patient's hematocrit first dropped and then increased, making answer D correct. Answers A, B, C, and E are incorrect although they are derived from the discharge summary. Answer A refers only to the decrease after the first transfusion. Answer B incorrectly states that the hematocrit remained the same. Answer C refers only to the increase following the second transfusion. In answer E, there is no record indicating that the final hematocrit level was 25.7."
123,2,14278950,What was the root cause of the patient's nausea and vomiting during her first admission and what treatment was employed to manage the situation?,"The patient's nausea and vomiting was due to her allergy to Morphine Sulfate and Ephedrine, and she was treated with antibiotics.","The cause of the patient's symptoms was a heartburn, which was managed by keeping the patient on the surgical service for further evaluation.","The patient's symptoms were due to her post-lap gastric banding condition, and an NG tube was employed as a solution, along with changes in her diet.","The patient's nausea and vomiting was due to her panic attacks, and the treatment was Prozac 40mg PO daily.","The patient's symptoms were a result of her ventral hernia, and the treatment was surgical hernia repair.",C,"The patient's vomiting and nausea occurred after she underwent lap gastric banding, as indicated in note 1. The surgical service placed an NG tube in her to manage the symptoms, and they adjusted her diet as well. The distractors, although derive information from the discharge summary, correspond to the wrong situations of her medical history or provide incorrect treatment (Antibiotics for allergies, surgery for hernia causing nausea). Hence, the correct answer is C."
124,2,16921013,What is the progression of the patient's medical therapies for pain management between her two admissions and did any of them raise a concern about her mental wellbeing?,"During the first admission, the patient was prescribed IV pain medications and transitioned to oral oxycodone and lorazepam for pain management. During her second admission, she shifted from oxycodone to Acetaminophen and HYDROmorphone, with no medications pointing towards a mental health concern.","In her first hospital stay, the patient was given diclofenac and lorazepam for pain regulation, later changed to bupropion and Acetaminophen in her second hospital visit. Neither medication regimes indicated a mental health concern.","In the first admission, the patient was started on diclofenac and bupropion, transitioning to oxycodone and lorazepam in the second admission, suggestive of her deteriorating mental wellbeing.","The patient was initially put on bupropion and Acetaminophen, which then transitioned to HYDROmorphone and oxycodone during her second admission. No medications suggested a concern about her mental health.","The patient started with IV fluids and IV pain medications, later transitioning to regular diet and oral medications in the first admission. In her second admission, she was changed to bupropion and Acetaminophen medication therapy, causing a possible concern about her mental wellbeing.",A,"During her first admission, the patient was initially given IV pain medications and later shifted to oral medications, more specifically oxycodone for pain and lorazepam for anxiety/agitation. This information is present in the discharge summary of her first admission. During her second visit, the medication was changed to Acetaminophen for general relief, HYDROmorphone for pain, and she continued taking bupropion which was administered for her depression since her first admission. There is no specific mention of a concern about her mental wellbeing in relation to her medications during either of the admissions.   B, C, D, and E are incorrect as they incorrectly reference the medications used during different admissions, with some stating a mental health concern that did not show up in the patient's notes."
125,2,13665289,What was the patient's hemoglobin level and major complications during her first childbirth and what was her condition during the second pregnancy's admission?,"The patient's hemoglobin level was 14.1 during her first childbirth with a major complication of a vaginal hematoma, and displayed symptoms of shortness of breath during the second pregnancy's admission.","The patient's hemoglobin level was 13.1 during her first childbirth with a major complication of pregnancy-induced hypertension, and was admitted with symptoms of fever during the second pregnancy.","The patient's hemoglobin level was 12.1 during her first childbirth with a major complication of a vaginal hematoma, and had symptoms of fever, myalgias, chills, abdominal pain, and foul-smelling vaginal bleeding during the second pregnancy's admission.","The patient’s hemoglobin level was 12.1 during the first childbirth with no significant complications, and had symptoms of lower abdominal quadrant tenderness during the second pregnancy's admission.","The patient's hemoglobin level was 11.1 during her first childbirth and had a major complication of anemia, while she was admitted with symptoms of chest pain during her second pregnancy.",C,"According to the first medical note, the patient's hemoglobin level was at 12.1 and she had a major complication in the form of a vaginal hematoma during her first childbirth. This corresponds with answer C. As for the second part of the question, her conditions during the second pregnancy's admission as stated in the second medical note involved fever, myalgias, chills, abdominal pain, and foul-smelling vaginal bleeding. Answer choices A, B, D, and E involve differing hemoglobin levels or complications during the first pregnancy, as well as differing symptoms during the second pregnancy's admission, which makes them incorrect but good distractors since they contain details from the medical notes."
126,2,12274703,What was the clinical decision taken to manage the patient's cholelithiasis diagnosed during her first hospitalization?,The patient was treated with behavioral modifications and diet adjustments.,The patient was treated with ERCP followed by continuous monitoring of liver function tests.,The patient was immediately booked for cholecystectomy upon diagnosis.,The patient was admitted for pain control with liver function tests repeated after discharge.,The patient was sent home with oral medication to manage her cholelithiasis.,B,"The correct answer is choice B, which mentions the ERCP procedure that was performed, in addition to monitoring the patient's liver function. This is according to the information in the first note which shows that, despite the presence of gallstones, the symptoms were not considered consistent with cholelithiasis initially. However, the ERCP was conducted later when ultrasound results suggested possible choledocholithiasis, which is a condition related to cholelithiasis. Incorrect answers are A and E (oral medication was used to treat GERD, not cholelithiasis), C (the idea of cholecystectomy was considered but deferred), and D (the patient did require pain control, but liver function tests were performed during hospitalization, not after discharge)."
127,2,13103363,What surgical procedures has the patient undergone to manage the recurrent giant cell tumor of the right proximal humerus?,Resection of the affected bone along with neoadjuvant therapy,Surgical decompression of the affected humerus,Excision of the tumor and bone marrow transplant,Curettage and allograft packing of the right proximal humerus lesion and right shoulder hemiarthroplasty,Radiation therapy to alleviate pain from the tumor,D,"In the provided notes, it is mentioned that the patient underwent curettage and allograft packing right proximal humerus lesion (note 1) and later underwent a right shoulder hemiarthroplasty (note 2), both aimed at managing the recurrent giant cell tumor. Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.   Choice A is incorrect because no mention is made of any resection or neoadjuvant therapy. Choice B is also wrong as no surgical decompression of the humerus was reported. Similarly, Choice C is incorrect because there's no evidence of any tumor excision or bone marrow transplant in the notes. Lastly, choice E is wrong as there's no mention of radiation therapy being used to manage the patient's tumor."
128,2,14697187,What was the range of the patient's blood pressure during her second hospital stay and what medications was she discharged with?,"The patient's blood pressure ranged from 150/90 to 210/110, and she was discharged with Labetalol 200 mg and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen.","The patient's blood pressure ranged from 160-170/90-100 to 140-150s/80-90s, and she was discharged with Nifedipine 30 mg and Labetalol 100 mg.","The patient's blood pressure was constant at 170/100, and she was discharged with Ibuprofen 600 mg and Nifedipine 30CR.","The patient's blood pressure ranged from 127/64 to 150/90, and she was discharged with Oxycodone-Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen 600 mg.","The patient's blood pressure ranged from 140-150s/80-90s to 160-170/90-100, and she was discharged with Nifedipine 30 mg and Ibuprofen 600mg.",B,"In note 2, the patient’s blood pressure value upon arrival ranged from 160-170/90-100 and later ranged between 140-150s/80-90s throughout the duration of her second stay. Also, the patient was discharged on Nifedipine 30 mg and Labetalol 100 mg. Choice A is incorrect because the upper blood pressure value (210/110), though mentioned, was what the patient reported at home and not in the hospital, and her discharge medication did not include Oxycodone-Acetaminophen in the second visit. Choice C is incorrect because her blood pressure was not constant at 170/100 during the second visit, and Ibuprofen was not included in her discharge medications. Choice D is incorrect because the lower blood pressure value (127/64) was monitored during her first hospitalization, not the second hospitalization, and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen 600 mg are not her discharge medications during the second visit. Choice E is incorrect - while it correctly states one of the blood pressure ranges, it incorrectly identifies Ibuprofen 600mg as a discharge medication during the second visit."
129,2,14230405,What complications did the patient experience following his initial surgery for left proximal humerus fracture and what subsequent procedure was performed to alleviate these complications?,The patient suffered from severe pain in the shoulder and subsequently underwent an umbilical hernia repair.,"Post-surgery, the patient experienced progressive osteonecrosis and a subscapularis tendon tear, which were treated by performing a left total shoulder with subscapularis repair.","Following the operation, the patient had an appendectomy to alleviate their complications.",The patient sustained progressive weakness in the left shoulder and was treated with pain catheter and PO meds.,"The patient had localised swelling to the left shoulder, and a hand surgery was performed next.",B,"From the available information, it can be deduced that the patient suffered from progressive osteonecrosis and a tear in the subscapularis tendon as complications of the initial surgery. These factors significantly limited the patient's left shoulder movement and caused persistent pain. To manage these complications, the patient had to undergo a left total shoulder with subscapularis repair.   option A is incorrect since it refers to an unrelated procedure. Option C is also wrong as it relates to an unrelated past surgical history, and option D is misleading as the treatment stated is for post-op pain control, not for the initial surgery complications. Lastly, option E is incorrect as the surgery isn't mentioned in the notes, and it refers to 'swelling,' which isn't the stated reason for the second surgery. The distractors try to mislead using unrelated surgeries and interpretations of various symptoms."
130,2,12384901,"What surgical procedure was carried out during the patient's second admission, and what was the primary complaint that led to this procedure?",Chondroplasty due to left knee pain,Subtotal medial meniscectomy due to gout,Total knee arthroscopy as the definitive treatment for left knee osteoarthritis,Arthroscopic debridement due to hypercholesterolemia,Placement of an external fixator due to a large medial femoral condyle osteonecrosis lesion,C,"According to the second note, the patient underwent a left total knee arthroscopy (otherwise known as a total knee replacement - TKA) during their second admission. The chief complaint driving this procedure was osteoarthritis in the left knee. Although answer A refers to a treatment that the patient did receive, it was during their first admission, not the second. Likewise, choice B mentions a procedure actually performed, but the wrong reason for it. Answer D mentions a non-related illness for a correct procedure, and choice E refers to a completely incorrect procedure."
131,2,12850397,What was the indication to use Aspirin in the patient's past medical history?,The patient was prescribed Aspirin because of his traumatic fracture of right ribs. ,The patient was prescribed Aspirin due to the presence of coronary calcifications detected on a CT scan.,The patient was using Aspirin for management of pain due to a post-fall injury.,The patient was prescribed Aspirin for post-polypectomy gastrointestinal bleeding.,The patient was using Aspirin as a part of regular home medications without any specific indication.,B,"As stated in note 2, the reason for the usage of Aspirin by the patient was the presence of coronary calcifications on a CT scan. This eliminates options A, C, D, and E, which either mention incorrect medical conditions (fracture of right ribs, post-fall injury, post-polypectomy gastrointestinal bleeding) or lack specific conditions (regular home medications without an indication). Though all distractors mention situations where Aspirin could be used, they do not accurately represent its use in the patient's past medical history as asked in the question."
132,2,11922082,What were the changes in the patient's medications for his neck pain from his first admission to the second admission?,The patient stopped taking docusate sodium during the second admission.,The dosage of hydromorphone was increased during the second admission.,Simvastatin was replaced with atorvastatin during the second admission.,The patient stopped taking levothyroxine during the second admission.,The dosage of synthroid was increased during the second admission.,C,"From the first to the second admission, the patient's medication for cholesterol, Simvastatin, was replaced with Atorvastatin. The rest of the answer options are incorrect. Although the patient was taking docusate sodium during the first admission, there is no mention of it in the second admission, but it doesn't specifically pertain to his neck pain (Option A). There is no evidence in the notes to suggest that the dosage of hydromorphone was increased (Option B). The patient was still taking levothyroxine in the second admission (Option D), and there is no evidence to suggest that the dosage of Synthroid was increased during the second hospitalization (Option E)."
133,2,14125568,"What changes were made to the patient's antihypertensive treatment between her first and second hospital visits, and why?","The patient was first given nifedipine, but this was replaced with ibuprofen at the second visit due to heightened blood pressure.","Between the patient's first and second hospital visits, her medication was changed from nifedipine to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide to better manage her elevated blood pressure.","During her first visit, the patient was given percocet and this was increased at the second visit owing to a slightly lower blood pressure reading.",The doctors replaced the patient's initial nifedipine medication with oxycodone since she wasn't responding well to the antihypertensive drug.,There were no changes in the patient's antihypertensive medication; they remained consistent across both visits.,B,"As per the patient's discharge summary, during her first visit she was given nifedipine 60 CR for her elevated blood pressures. However, during her second visit, it was noted that despite the nifedipine treatment, her blood pressures remained elevated. As such, she was started on Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and lisinopril to better manage her condition. The other options are incorrect as they do not accurately detail this transition. Ibuprofen (A) and oxycodone (D) are pain medications, not antihypertensive drugs. Percocet (C) is also a pain reliever and was not used as an antihypertensive medication. Finally, choice E is incorrect because it contradicts the information provided in the summaries."
134,2,12403669,What was the treatment approach and the final condition of the patient during his second admission in relation to his partial small bowel obstruction?,The patient was given analgesics and discharged with moderate symptoms.,The patient was treated with a surgical intervention to clear the blockage.,"The patient was placed on no oral intake, intravenous fluids, and a nasogastric tube, and was discharged upon tolerance of solid foods and symptom control.",The patient was given medications to relieve the obstruction.,The patient's condition worsened and he was kept for observation.,C,"In the patient's second admission, as detailed in note 2, his treatment for partial small bowel obstruction consisted of keeping him on no oral intake (NPO), intravenous fluids (IVF), and a nasogastric tube (NG tube). The patient's diet was gradually advanced to solid foods, which he tolerated well without nausea or abdominal pain. He was then discharged in a stable condition, with instructions to follow up with his primary care provider and gastroenterologist. This matches choice C. Choices A, B, D, and E are not accurate based on the information in the patient's notes. Option A is incorrect because there's no mention of analgesics being used. Option B is incorrect because the patient did not undergo any surgical intervention during his second admission. Option D is wrong because no direct medication was given to relieve the obstruction. Option E is incorrect as the patient's condition did not worsen; instead, he was discharged in a stable, symptom-controlled state."
135,2,14152852,What surgery did the patient undergo during their first admission and what was the discharge condition?,"The patient underwent an emergency cesarean section and was discharged in an ambulatory, clear and coherent condition.","The patient underwent a colposcopy and was discharged in a clear, coherent, and alert condition.","During the patient's first admission, the patient had a laparoscopic appendectomy and was discharged in a clear, conscious, independent ambulatory state.","The patient underwent surgery for a tubal ectopic pregnancy and was discharged in an alert, independent ambulatory state.",The patient received surgery for a hysterectomy and was discharged in an ambulatory state with clear mental status.,C,"The discharge summary from the patient's first admission reveals that the patient had a Laparoscopic Appendectomy and was discharged in a clear, coherent, and alert condition. She was ambulatory and independent at the time of discharge. The other options (A, B, D, and E) are good distractors because they are surgeries or procedures that may relate to the patient's gender, reported symptoms, or medical history, but they are not the correct answer as per given discharge notes."
136,2,13832977,What were the discharge medications prescribed to the patient during his first and second hospital visits and what was the reason for these prescriptions?,"During the first visit, the patient was prescribed anastrozole, acetaminophen, alprazolam, bisacodyl, cyclobenzaprine, docusate sodium, and hydromorphone for controlling pain and anxiety, and prevention of fever. During the second visit, hydromorphone was prescribed to manage post-surgical pain.","The patient was prescribed acetaminophen, alprazolam, and hydromorphone during the first visit for pain relief, and docusate sodium during the second visit for maintaining bowel regularity.","During the first visit, medications including acetaminophen, bisacodyl, cyclobenzaprine, and docusate sodium were prescribed to the patient for fever and spasm and during the second visit, hydromorphone was prescribed for pain relief.","During both visits, the patient was prescribed hydromorphone and docusate sodium for pain relief and maintaining bowel regularity.","Anastrozole, bisacodyl, and hydromorphone were given to the patient in the first visit to control pain and anxiety, while in the second visit, the patient was prescribed only anastrozole.",A,"In the discharge summary of both hospital visits, the specified drugs were listed to be given to the patient upon discharge. Answer A encapsulates all these drugs correctly for both visits and correctly states their purpose. Choices B, C, D, and E present a subset of the actual prescribed medications and, therefore, are incomplete answers. None of the other choices correctly encapsulate the prescriptions for both visits."
137,2,12590128,What was the course of treatment administered to the patient when she noted vaginal bleeding at 24 weeks of her pregnancy and how was her condition at the time of discharge?,"The patient was given betamethasone and regular ultrasounds, and when discharged she was in a stable state.","The patient was given a dilation and curettage procedure, and was discharged in a non-stable condition.","The patient was treated for hypertension, and was discharged in a stable condition.","The patient was given betamethasone and no ultrasound, and when discharged she was in a non-stable state.","The patient was given a Prenatal Vitamin course, and when discharged she was in a stable condition.",A,"The note indicates that the patient was given ""betamethasone course for fetal lung maturity."" She had an ultrasound and did not have any further bleeding. She was discharged in a stable condition with a plan for close follow-up. The other options are incorrect as they either incorrectly mention the course of treatment received by the patient for her vaginal bleeding or inaccurately report her condition at discharge. For instance, option B refers to a dilation and curettage procedure that was not mentioned in note 1 but in note 2 and related to a different time and condition. Option C refers to a treatment for hypertension, which is not reported in the notes. Option D incorrectly states that no ultrasound was made while option E inaccurately refers the course of treatment with Prenatal Vitamin course. None of the incorrect options reflect both the course of treatment for vaginal bleeding at her 24 weeks of pregnancy and her discharge condition as stated in the question."
138,2,18307648,What were the therapeutic measures taken to manage the fractures in the patient's right lower extremity from her first hospital admission post accident to her subsequent admission for orthopedic surgery?,The patient was given Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) for the fractures.,"The fractures were first evaluated to be stable by orthopedic surgery and the patient was discharged home using crutches. In the next admission, patient underwent ORIF right lateral tibial plateau, reconstruction LCL and fibular head fixation.","Physical therapy was given, followed by ORIF right lateral tibial plateau and administration of appeared clear SP.","Patient's right lower extremity was kept in a brace and she was recommended to walk with crutches. In the next admission, physical therapy was given.",Patient was provided WBC-8.0 RBC-4.65 HGB-14.7 HCT-42.8 MCV-92 MCH-31.5 MCHC-34.3 RDW-12.4 for the fractures.,B,"The correct answer is B. From the notes, we understand that during the first hospitalization, the patient’s fractures on the right tib/fib were evaluated as stable by orthopedic surgery. She was safe for discharge with the use of crutches. In her following admission, she underwent Orthopaedic surgery including ORIF right lateral tibial plateau, reconstruction LCL, and fibular head fixation. This explains the sequential therapeutic measures taken to manage the fractures.  Answer A is incorrect as Sulfa was mentioned as an allergy, not a treatment. Answer C is incorrect because the treatment plan did not include the administration of SP during the first or the second admission. Answer D is incorrect as physical therapy was not mentioned as part of treatment in the second admission. Answer E is incorrect as these are results from blood tests and not therapeutic measures for treating fractures."
139,2,12746410,What was the follow-up procedure performed after the patient's cold knife cone procedure for cervical adenocarcinoma in situ?,Patient was treated with a solution at the bleeding area on the postoperative site,Patient underwent a LEEP bed cauterization,Patient was discharged and monitored closely at home,Patient was given medication to control the bleeding,Patient underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy,E,"The discharge summary notes state that after the patient's two cold knife cone procedures for cervical adenocarcinoma in situ, she underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy which is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus. Hence, option E is the correct answer. Although option A, ""Patient was treated with a solution at the bleeding area on the postoperative site"" and Option B, ""Patient underwent a LEEP bed cauterization"" are procedures that the patient underwent, they were not the main follow-up procedure done after the cone biopsy. Option C and D are incorrect as they don't represent a follow-up procedure but instead are methods of monitoring and managing the patient's bleeding post-surgery."
140,2,17420292,What was the patient's latest discharge diagnosis and what future plan of action was suggested?,"The patient's most recent discharge diagnosis was acute pancreatitis and papillary stenosis, with a suggested plan of undertaking aggressive IV hydration at 200 cc/hr and a diet advancement to clear liquids and then advance as tolerated.","The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of abdominal pain, following which she was suggested to maintain a diet of clear liquids and then proceed as tolerated.","The patient was last discharged with a diagnosis of pancreatitis and papillary stenosis, and her future plan consists of staying NPO overnight and if pain-free in the AM, gradually advancing her diet.","The patient's last discharge diagnosis was pancreatitis, and she was advised to schedule an appointment for a follow-up visit with Dr. ___ in six weeks due to her new/acute pancreatitis pain.","The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis & hypothyroidism, post which she was advised to maintain a bowel regimen for constipation and take Dilaudid 0.125mg IV every 4 hours if there's any pain.",D,"Option D is correct because the last discharge diagnosis for the patient according to note 2 was pancreatitis. Moreover, they advised her to have an outpatient follow-up with Dr. ___ in six weeks. This option fits the question correctly. Options A and C refer to the first discharge summary, not the latest one, making them incorrect. Option B presents an incorrect diagnosis, and option E distorts the context of the treatment plan suggested in the discharge summary."
141,2,14021089,"What was the patient's treatment plan for managing her papillary thyroid carcinoma and how has her health responded to this plan so far, based on the available discharge summaries written on March 5, 2182 and April 21, 2182, respectively?","The patient was initially placed on levothyroxine to manage her papillary thyroid carcinoma but showed no improvement, leading to a total thyroidectomy.","The patient underwent an initial prescribed I131 treatment followed by thyroidectomy, which led to worsening health conditions.","The patient, due to her papillary thyroid carcinoma, underwent a total thyroidectomy followed by I131 treatment, and showed tolerance to the procedure with no present complications.","The patient had her thyroid carcinoma managed through a combined treatment of I131 and radiation therapy, resulting in worsened health conditions.","The patient was administered with levothyroxine and lorazepam for her papillary thyroid carcinoma, however, she did not show significant improvement.",C,"According to the notes, the patient initially underwent a total thyroidectomy because of the suspicious papillary carcinoma (as stated in note 1). After the surgery, she was stable, tolerated a regular diet, and was voiding and ambulating independently. In the follow-up visit, the patient went for a scheduled I131 treatment because she had a child at home (as stated in note 2). The patient just experienced moderate fatigue, no other symptoms of hypothyroidism were reported. Therefore, her health condition responded positively to the treatment plan.   Choice A is incorrect because levothyroxine was not used to treat papillary carcinoma but was given after the thyroidectomy to replace the hormones the body can no longer produce since the thyroid was removed.   Choice B is incorrect because the surgical procedure was completed before the I131 treatment, not the other way around, and no worsening health conditions were recorded after both treatments.   Choice D is incorrect because radiation therapy was not mentioned once in the notes, and no worsened health conditions were noted.   Choice E is incorrect because these medications were not the primary treatment for her carcinoma. Her response to surgery and the subsequent I131 treatment was positive."
142,2,13969679,What were the results of the 24 hour urine protein test performed during the patient's two hospital visits and what did they indicate about her condition?,"The 24 hour urine protein level was abnormal, indicating preeclampsia","The 24 hour urine protein level was above 300, indicating kidney damage","The 24 hour urine protein level was below 300, suggesting no preeclampsia",The 24 hour urine protein levels revealed a high blood pressure condition,The 24 hour urine protein levels were insufficient for a valid diagnosis,C,"The notes indicate that during both hospital visits, the 24-hour urine protein was below 300 (note 1: < 300, note 2: within normal limits), suggesting the absence of preeclampsia. The incorrect answer options are good distractors because they do contain terms or concepts mentioned within the discharge summaries but they do not accurately represent the test results or the indicated condition."
143,2,16092848,What were the post-operative complications experienced by the patient after the first surgery and how were they managed?,The patient developed severe pain which was managed through progressive introduction of oral pain medications.,The patient developed an obstruction that was managed through an aggressive bowel regimen.,"The patient had an ileus with no evidence of obstruction. This was managed by making the patient follow a nil per mouth (NPO) regime, providing IV hydration, and an aggressive bowel treatment until the patient had a bowel movement and flatus.",The patient experienced adverse reactions to medication which were managed by altering the prescription.,The patient had severe bleeding that was controlled by medication and medical intervention.,C,"The patient's post-operative complication from the first surgery was an ileus (note 1, lines 26-28). The regulation of the patient's eating and drinking along with the initiation of an aggressive bowel regimen effectively managed the complication. The other options are incorrect; there were no indications in the discharge synopsis of the patient developing severe pain (option A), no obstructions (option B), no adverse medication reactions (option D), or excessive bleeding (option E)."
144,2,11483750,"What is the main variation in the patient's discharged condition between the two visits, recorded on 2148-01-02 and on 2148-11-05?","The first time, the patient was diagnosed with cervical stenosis, and on the second visit, he was diagnosed with back and right leg pain.","During the first visit, the patient complained of back pain, while he reported of neck pain in the second visit.",The patient was allowed to walk as much as he could tolerate on the first visit but was limited to intermittent walking for the second visit.,"The first visit ended with the patient being prescribed hydromorphone, but on the second visit, he was prescribed acetaminophen.","In the first visit, the patient was suggested to stay active after surgery, while in the second visit, his activity was limited.",A,"Answer choice A is correct because the discharge diagnosis in the first visit (2148-01-02) was 'Cervical stenosis' and in the second visit (2148-11-05) it was 'Radicular pain and spondylolisthesis'. The other options, B, C, D, and E, although contain information from the discharge summaries, they do not accurately reflect the variation in the patient's discharged condition in relation to the provided question."
145,2,13116800,What interventions were taken on the patient's subsequent visits following her severe narrowing of the rectosigmoid s/p resection with colostomy?,The patient's diet was advanced and she underwent a kidney removal procedure on one of her visits.,"During a follow-up visit, the patient had a hysterectomy due to injured ureter complications.",The patient underwent a series of dilation procedures and a metal stent placement in the stenotic area during subsequent visits.,The patient was administered antibiotics and pain management medications in one of her visits.,The patient was repeatedly admitted for observation and only provided symptom relief by pain control.,C,"The correct answer choice indicates two procedures: dilation and metal stent placement. These were performed on the patient's subsequent visits following her severe narrowing of the rectosigmoid (as evidenced in both note 1 and note 2). The rest of the answer choices reference other parts of the patient's history and are not directly related to the interventions taken due to the patient's condition of severe narrowing of the rectosigmoid. For instance, option A discusses the patient's diet advancement and kidney removal which is from her past medical history, not the interventions related to her rectosigmoid narrowing. Similarly, option B talks about a hysterectomy which was a past surgical procedure and not related to the given condition. Option D and E mention medications and observation, respectively. Although these could be part of the overall treatment plan, they do not specifically address the interventions taken for the patient's condition as asked in the question."
146,2,12574224,What surgical procedures were performed on this patient during the duration of his two hospital stays and what were his discharge instructions pertaining to physical activities?,The patient underwent a left ankle external fixator placement and a right tibial plafond fixation. His discharge instructions required him to be partially weight bearing on his right leg.,The patient had a right ankle external fixator placement and a subsequent removal followed by an open reduction and internal fixation of his right pilon fracture. His discharge instructions demanded strict non-weight bearing on his right lower extremity.,"Multiple surgeries were performed on the patient including right ankle external fixator placement, open reduction and internal fixation, as well as a rotator cuff repair. His physical activity instructions were ambulatory with a walker.",The patient had an open reduction and internal fixation for his right ankle. The patient's discharge instructions were to engage in light activities.,"Invasive procedures such as right ankle external fixator placement and pilon fracture fixation were performed on the patient. For physical activities, the patient was advised to be mobile with an ankle brace.",B,"According to the discharge notes, the patient underwent a right ankle external fixator placement during his first hospital stay. Subsequently, he was readmitted for the removal of the external fixator and had an open reduction and internal fixation for his right tibial plafond. The discharge notes also specifically mentioned that the patient was to be non-weight bearing on his right leg, thus making Option B the correct answer. The other options are incorrect as they either specify incorrect surgical procedures or incorrect discharge instructions for physical activities. For instance, Option D suggests that the patient is allowed light activities, which contradicts the non-weight bearing instructions. Similarly, Option C incorrectly suggests a rotator cuff repair was done, which is nowhere mentioned in the notes."
147,2,14808557,"What was the cervical length of the patient during her admission on 2182-05-26, and how did this compare to her cervical exam during the admission on 2182-07-18?",The cervical length was 38mm on 2182-05-26 and was relatively fixed at 50% during the admission on 2182-07-18,The cervical length was 52% on 2182-05-26 and changed to 4cm during her admission on 2182-07-18,The cervical length was closed/long in 2182-05-26 and remained closed/long during her admission on 2182-07-18,The cervical length was 38mm in 2182-05-26 and modified to 4cm during her admission on 2182-07-18,The cervical length was closed on 2182-05-26 and remained closed during her admission on 2182-07-18,D,"During the patient's admission on 2182-05-26, her cervical length was specifically noted as 38mm in the discharge summary. During her admission on 2182-07-18, her cervical exam results indicated it was 4cm. Although other options glance about certain aspects of the patient's cervical condition during the two admissions, they fail to encompass fully or misrepresent the comparisons called out in the question. While option C has some truth in that her cervix was closed and long on 2182-05-26, it does not accurately reflect the specific measure given. Option E is incorrect because the phrase ""closed"" refers to the status of the cervix, not its length. Option A and B incorrectly stated the cervical length as percentages."
148,2,19913435,What were the options for management of significant cervical insufficiency discussed with the patient during her first admission and what was the course of action taken?,"Discussion with patient included options such as: immediate surgery, delivery via cesarean section, or hormone therapy treatment. Patient chose to proceed with surgery.","Management options discussed included: administration of antibiotics, insertion of a cervical pessary, or a transvaginal ultrasound. Patient opted for antibiotics treatment.","Options such as: therapeutic bed rest, termination of pregnancy, or transabdominal cerclage were discussed. Decision was made to go with transabdominal cerclage.","Discussed options included: expectant management, amnio to rule out infection followed by rescue cerclage, and termination. Patient chose amniocentesis and planned for rescue cerclage, but due to complications, expectant management was ultimately chosen.","Management courses discussed were: physical therapy, progesterone treatment, or planned cerclage. Patient decided to continue with progesterone treatment.",D,"Answer choice D paraphrases the correct information from note 1: the options for the patient's significant cervical insufficiency included expectant management, an amniocentesis to rule out infection followed by a rescue cerclage, and termination. The patient decided to undergo an amniocentesis and rescue cerclage. However, during the rescue cerclage procedure, they discovered that it couldn't be done, and the patient chose expectant management. Options A, B, C, and E are incorrect. They are good distractors because they include the treatment options for cervical insufficiency and other services provided by the OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY unit, but they do not accurately reflect the treatment discussion and decisions made during the patient’s first admission."
149,2,18102615,What was the primary cause suspected for the patient's abdominal pain during her admission on 2161-06-25 and what was her primary complaint during her admission on 2167-07-02?,The patient's abdominal pain was suspected to be caused by rheumatoid arthritis and her primary complaint in the second admission was UTI.,The patient was suspected to have kidney stones causing her abdominal pain and her main reason of admission on 2167-07-02 was related to tonsillitis.,It was suspected that acute pancreatitis caused her abdominal pain and her primary complaint during her second admission was gestational hypertension.,The patient was suspected to have gallstones causing her abdominal pain and her main complaint on 2167-07-02 was congestive heart failure.,The abdominal pain was believed to be due to appendicitis and the primary issue during the second admission was pre-eclampsia.,C,"The discharge summary from the first admission clearly states that the patient's abdominal pain was due to acute pancreatitis. Incorrect options were introduced to mislead with other conditions discussed in the note. In the second admission, the patient was admitted for gestational hypertension, hence she was evaluated for 'PIH eval'. Other options listed are incorrect as they are not stated as issues in the discharge summary but still linked to the information from the summary. For example, UTI was mentioned but was not the reason for the second admission whereas tonsillitis, pre-eclampsia, and congestive heart failure, are not mentioned in the second admission."
150,2,12337935,"What was the gestational age and complications, if any, of the patient's last pregnancy recorded in the discharge summaries?",The patient had her last pregnancy at 21 weeks gestational age and faced cervical incompetence.,The last pregnancy was at 14.0 weeks gestational age and showed no complications.,The patient's last pregnancy was at 40 weeks 3 days gestational age and was complicated by gestational hypertension.,The patient's most recent pregnancy occurred at 15 weeks gestational age with complications of cervical insufficiency.,Last pregnancy was at 13 weeks gestational age and no complications were reported.,C,"The last note indicates that the patient was admitted for induction of labor at 40 weeks 3 days, and it was complicated by gestational hypertension. This was the most recent pregnancy noted in the discharge summaries. Option A is incorrect as it refers to a previous pregnancy with cervical incompetence, not the last one. B, D, and E are incorrect as the gestational ages mentioned are far less than what is given in the last note and do not indicate the true level of gestational progress or the proper complications from the most recent pregnancy."
